A short way for the Hamburgers for which the regional train is enough-on this day it was for 855 Hamburg football fans and about 150 other unfortunate but a much longer excursion because the federal police took their harassment to the extreme and a whole fan train in Station of the Hamburg margin Bergedorf stopped and with around 400 officers the fans harassed and found all identities.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  The pretext: you are looking for 60 \"violent offenders\", in which a small chat had occurred with supporters of Borussia Dortmund last September in the Mannheim train station. 31 of them are now of the opinion of having identified, including the use of so-called \"super-recognizer\", police officers who specialize in the memory of faces.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n   Already in Rostock, where some HSV rags had rioted against a stadium snack and there were further arguments, bottle throws, etc. Between Hamburg fans and police officers, the police at the train station after the game fans before departure of the train, whereby panic came up . Then in Bergedorf\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n   the regional express was stopped at 7:45 p.m.\n  </span>\n  <em>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    \u201e\n   </span>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   The train stops here and does not continue. Everyone is now checked. \"\n  </em>\n  . The checks began at 8:10 p.m., the last ones were only through at 2:20 a.m. In that time, the almost thousand inmates had to endure in the heat of the crowded train, without drinking water and, with a steaming of visits to the toilet and a wizard help (\"there are no\" - that is the bulls that are said to have expressed themselves). Several people are said to have received circulatory problems and sometimes collapse; Minors were felt without consideration; People are said to have screamed out of panic and pain.\n  <em>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    \"The police were very aggressive towards the HSV fans, very little was communicated from the start\"\n   </span>\n  </em>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n   ,\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n   Anonymous fan reports to \"T-Online\".\n  </span>\n  <em>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    \u201cThe right hand did not know what the left. A policeman pushed me away and said that I should go back in the row. I just said his colleague sent me here. \"\n   </span>\n  </em>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    Women were also checked, although only men were sought in Mannheim according to the allegations of the crime. The police forces on site were not informed - which you can well imagine. A young girl was even prevented from getting out of some stations in front of Bergedorf because the control is in Bergedorf.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    D\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    is HSV supporters club\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hsv_sc/status/1759228426248982930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1759228426248982930%7Ctwgr%5Ede292be897016d1f1f4454b49ee2c76dfd88c42a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-online.de%2Fregion%2Fhamburg%2Fid_100347254%2Fhsv-bei-hansa-rostock-bundespolizei-nach-grosskontrolle-scharf-kritisiert.html\">\n     Now wants to complain against the operations management and asks all those affected for memory protocols\n    </a>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hsv_sc/status/1759228426248982930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1759228426248982930%7Ctwgr%5Ede292be897016d1f1f4454b49ee2c76dfd88c42a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-online.de%2Fregion%2Fhamburg%2Fid_100347254%2Fhsv-bei-hansa-rostock-bundespolizei-nach-grosskontrolle-scharf-kritisiert.html\">\n   <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n     .\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </a>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    At this point you have to keep in mind that the reaction of such procedures almost always tested in other areas in order to later apply it to the revolutionary movement.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    Parallels to this illegal use, in which large amounts of personal quantities due to the allegation of the\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    Fracture of the peace\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    s for hours under miserable conditions, there are\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    For example, even with the Lina protests in various Cities of the FRG on May 31 last year, where countless, without having committed a crime, ends up for a long evening in the police kettle and beyond\n   </span>\n  </span>\n  <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n    in.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <img alt=\"HSV Bergedorf Bullen Einsatz I\" src=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Sport/2024/HSV_Bergedorf_Bullen_Einsatz_I.jpg\" srcset=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Sport/2024/HSV_Bergedorf_Bullen_Einsatz_I.jpg\"/>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">\n   <em>\n    Source: t-online.de (both pictures)\n   </em>\n  </span>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/t-brd/8324-sport-polizei-haelt-855-hsv-fans-fast-7-stunden-in-zug-gefangen", "keywords": ["Internetplattform", "revolution\u00e4re Bewegung", "Dem Volke Dienen", "Nachrichten", "Theorie"], "author": "awwa", "description": "Internet platform for the development of a revolutionary movement", "title": "Sport: The police keep 855 HSV fans caught in Zug for almost 7 hours", "tags": ["Hamburg", "Sport"]}
