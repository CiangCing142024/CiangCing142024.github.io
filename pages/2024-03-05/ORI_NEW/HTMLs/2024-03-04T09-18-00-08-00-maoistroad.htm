   The
elections for the European Parliament in May-June will take place in
a period of multiple-level attack on the rights of the peoples of
Europe and furthermore in a period of war and bloody conflicts on the
European continent.

   In
all previous years, the dominant imperialist powers in the European
Union have consolidated the exploitation and plundering of the
peoples and workers in the countries of Europe. Extreme austerity
policies have been implemented, the poor and middle classes have been
squeezed with salary cuts and the attack on their labour rights, and
the peasants have seen the onset of the CAP policy that targets them.
Youth continued to be at the centre of the attack with European
policies striking at studies and labour rights; additionally, not
only did the Bologna policies not bring better days for young people
studying, but it worsened the conditions of studying and even forced
many students to abandon education. Working youth, poor working class
youth, those living on the fringes of poverty, migrants and
“second-class citizens” as they are called, have been dealt a
severe blow. On one hand they were the first to accept the measures
of cuts and austerity; on the other hand they saw their democratic
rights being overturned.

   In
all the developments of recent years, the EU is once again emerging
as a force that supports and participates in unjust wars, a force
responsible for the slaughter of peoples. The unjust war in Ukraine,
apart from the stamp of the imperialists of Russia and the USA, also
bears the stamp of EU’s intervention and support of fascist and
far-right groups. At the same time, the ongoing ethnic cleansing of
the Palestinian people has the support of the forces of the European
Union. The repression and the ban on the mobilizations of solidarity
to the Palestinian people is the primary direction of the EU
countries. The decision of the European Parliament -by an
overwhelming majority- to recognise "Israel's right to
self-defence" while there is a prolonged massacre in Gaza of a
people living for years under the occupation of the fascist state of
Israel is an obvious example of how democratic and humanitarian the
EU edifice is. It is clear that solidarity with the Palestinian
people and the struggle for freedom in Palestine means abstaining
from the war-mongering EU edifice and abstaining from the European
elections.

   The
policies of extreme racism, the rise of far-right parties in the
countries of the European Union and in the European Parliament are
supported by and underpin the reactionary, racist and anti-communist
policies of the main systemic forces. New forces have emerged and old
forces have been strengthened, which represent the extremes of
capitalism, exploitation and social, ethnic, religious, cultural and
gender discrimination. All this ideological and political offensive
that has proceeded in parallel with the attack on the rights and
conquests of decades was necessary for the imperialist bourgeoisies
of the EU. It was needed to put the workers and the oppressed in the
spotlight and put the blame for the ongoing crisis on them. These
far-right and fascist policies not only do not oppose the EU but are
its “flesh and blood”. This is the political perception of the
capitalist imperialist system which manifests itself when it is in
crisis or in danger.

   At
the same time, the pandemic crisis and the outbreak of SARS-Covid 19,
although initially did create a problem for the production process
and the capitalist system as a whole, turned into an opportunity for
an additional attack through anti-worker and anti-

   The
myth of “Europe of the peoples”, of the social-human face of the
European Union is now showing its true face. The face of war,
exploitation and barbarism. The face of imperialism-capitalism which
is only interested in the reproduction of its profits and its
political supremacy over its opponents. It is obvious to anyone who
wants to see it that a handful of imperialist countries are running
the EU. They are promoting the exploitation of the bourgeoisie
against all the other peoples’ and working classes and at the same
time they are squeezing the wealth out of the remaining dependent
countries. This is the reality of the European Union. A union
dominated by contradictions and antagonism, a union that is doomed to
fail.

   This
rotten and exploitative edifice also needs the semblance of democracy
to be sold to the people. It needs the European Parliament to work to
disorientate the people and convince them that it can be changed and
fixed. But the truth is that the European Parliament is a puppet
without any meaningful and decisive functions, a spectacle set up to
deceive the peoples of Europe and to distract them from their
struggle. It is a “greenhouse” where the system's lobbies grow,
in which the only thing the so-called MEPs obey to is the “money
bags” available to the capitalists to promote their interests
inside and outside the EU.

   We
support the struggles of the peoples and workers. These are the
struggles that the governments of the EU countries are bashing and
vilifying. We support the strikes that broke out in France for the
right of the people to a pension they can live with, the strikes of
transport workers in Germany and Spain. We support the struggles of
the peasants like recently in France and Greece. The continuation and
the path towards justice for the workers' and peoples’ struggles
does not go through the acceptance of the miserable illusions about
the European Parliament and the EU. The working peoples’
mobilizations are the hope for a better future for the workers and
peoples of Europe.

   The
way of the peoples is outside the European Parliament and against the
EU, a way of solidarity and fellowship. For a life with rights and
gains against imperialism and exploitation. A life that can only be
won by a COMMON FRONT of the peoples against this barbaric and
reactionary alliance of imperialists and capitalists.

   All
of us who sign this document, left and communist organizations,
refuse to legitimate the operation of embellishment of a historically
reactionary imperialist construct. We refuse to participate in a
farcical and mockery process like that of the European elections. We
call for mass abstention from the European elections and actively
fight to bring the working peoples’ movements to the forefront of
the struggles. We call on the peoples of Europe not to vote in the
European elections as they are a farce, and become active subjects in
the struggle against the policies of the European Union. We call on
democrats and progressive people to put a stop to the war-mongering
policies supported by the European Union that have brought war in our
neighbourhood. We are fighting to get our countries out of the EU
edifice. We support the right of peoples to fight and struggle for
their rights, for a society without exploitation and wars. We call
for mass abstention from the European elections and for mass and
active participation in the peoples’ struggles.
