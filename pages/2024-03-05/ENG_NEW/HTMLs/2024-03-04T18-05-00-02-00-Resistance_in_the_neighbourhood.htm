   "24 -year -old American soldier set fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington ..."
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>
  "My name is Aaron Busnell. I am an active member of the US Air Force and I will no longer be a genocide complicit. I am going to subsidize an extreme protest act, but compared to what they are experiencing
  <a href="https://www.lifo.gr/tags/polemos-israil-hamas" target="_blank">
   People in Palestine
  </a>
  , it's not extreme at all ... ". In these words, on February 25, 2024, 24 -year -old American soldier Aaron Busnell set fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington shouting "freedom in Palestine". The day after, succumbing to his wounds, he left his last breath in the hospital. It is striking that while he was wrapped in flames, a police officer of the Israeli Embassy guard, he was marking him with a gun, while his colleague screaming "I don't need weapons, I need fire extinguishers!"
 </p>
 <p>
  24 -year -old Aaron, the "human man", has served in the US Armed Forces for almost four years. He had graduated from basic education "first in class" and according to the first testimonies of friends and acquaintances was "social, gentle, cheerful and positive", which denies any attempts to attribute his act to a mental disorder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, almost three months ago, on December 1, 2023, a woman wrapped in the Palestinian flag set fire outside the Israeli consulate in Atlanta, USA and was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
 </p>
 <p>
  How much, such incidents have happened around the world, without being able to penetrate the law of the silence of international media?
 </p>
 <p>
  Acts of despair or heroic acts of protest? In any case, the crime that takes place in Gaza since October 7, the genocide of the Palestinian people who have so far led to over 30,000 dead, with over half of being young children, the slow and excruciating death of hundreds daily by daily Food, water and medicine shortages, the constant bombings that have turned the country into a skull, cannot be silenced. Not even the popular anger. Millions of protesters daily in all lengths and widths of the planet, even in the great metropolises of capitalism, fill the streets for the slaughter.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of these acts of protest, from young Aaron's self -identification to the millions of protesters create, but also show, the serious tricks that the genocide in Gaza provokes inside the imperialist states of the West. Terrrps that were also shown in their "reluctance" (except for other reasons) to join the US Naval Enterprise in the US in the Red Sea. A company that, despite the initial statements of the US Minister of National Defense on 20 participating countries, met the objections of France, Spain, Denmark, Australia and Italy.
