  The list of employees who also resigned also includes Lieutenant Colonel Merav Granot Stoller and Lieutenant Colonel Tzupia Moshkovich. The latter, according to the report, “was in charge of the Shayetet 13 unit” before Hagari's appointment.

In fact, according to channel 14, Hagari served as assistant of Gadi Eisenkot and Benny Gantz.
