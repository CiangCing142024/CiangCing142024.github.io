   Today we publish transcription 
 Complete of the Center for Strategic and 
 International Studies “Ukraine in the Balance: A Battlefield Update 
 on the war in ukraine ”, which last Friday we publish them 
 incomplete, we also made the mistake of consigning the CSIS as a 
 Yankee Imperialism Institute, when it is from English imperialism 
 As can be seen at the UK publication, this is the kingdom 
 United. We lohico with the rush of time, because we consider that 
 It was very important that our readers conceive, in the opinion of 
 The military and security experts of Yankee imperialism, such as 
 They are Eliot Cohen, former state department advisor, Emily Harding, 
 An intelligence expert of the SCIS that was previously CIA, of the 
 US National Security Council, etc., and Mike Vickers, 
 former Undersecretary of Defense Intelligence, Operations Officer 
 of the CIA.

 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   The importance of the document is that 
 contains the discussion between these experts that represent the 
 interests of one of the factions of Yankee imperialism, that of 
 current Biden government and PD, on how the development of the 
 War from its beginning to date, the stages that according to them carry 
 Tour, until you reach the current moment of the War of positions, 
 With the different terrestrial, aerial and naval bells, where they show the successes and failures, the strengths and weak, etc. 
 From both part, the symbolic importance of the taking of Avdiivka 
 For political development in Russia, linked to the death of Levany, 
 and its limited military value. Make an interesting comparison between 1914 and 2023, where 
 They see great potential for instability and innovation on both sides 
 In this war, his appreciation of the Naval Campana of the Ukraine 
 It is important.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   See how Imperialists focus on their "help" 
 military to impose dependence on the Ukrainian nation, that is 
 get through the back door, while the Ukrainian nation combat 
 the invasion of the aggressive forces of Russian imperialism. I know there 
 reveals his cynicism, when he recognizes that with this "help" 
 They win are their own companies, they say:
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   „(…) The money we spend on 
 Ukraine does not leave the United States to the defense industry of the 
 USA .. You go to US companies that send help to Ukraine. The 
 Vast majority of this stay here. ”
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   That is double gain.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   <br/>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   The interests of the government 
 Imperialist Yankee of Biden are expressed in the opinions of these 
 experiences, among many others, when they talk about the meaning of this 
 War, etc. The statements of the representatives of all imperialist countries regarding war, in terms of "help", sending of armament and threat of being used has or seeks to have an effect on the opinion of the countries involved, in the elections and internal political development , because as reads the second annex and the news about the conversations of German ocial Mass destruction, including the military. Of its proopias conditions and possibility. Especially of the strategic balance at the level of those weapons of the Russian and Yankees imperialists.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   Well, above all this we will return more 
 forward. But, we reiterate in reference to the two annexes, in 
 our position on the development of contradictions in this 
 War of aggression of Russian imperialism against the nation 
 Ukraine, in which the main contradiction is oppressed nation 
 Against Russian imperialist aggression war. Than the imperialists 
 In their wars against oppressed nations they can only 
 Coquisote failures and get engaged in the quagmire. That he 
 Yankee Emprialism is the fat dog and the main enemy of the 
 Peoples of the world and Russian imperialism is the skinny dog, such as 
 Aggressive imperialism in Ukraine is the main enemy there.

 that. And we have had - we have had a session on that as good. Let me 
 Start: if we could open the battlefield map. This is at the beginning 
 of this month. We get out of the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, Defense 
 Intelligence. And what I wanted to do is remind everyone where we have come 
 of. So you can't see it on the map itself, but you visualize it after 
 Russian initial attacks on at least five axes did control the 
 territory, some of which we can see here. They also tried to push 
 down from Belarus and parts of Russia to take kyiv, in what 
 They failed. Járkov City, which, as you can see, is not under Russian control, 
 in which they failed. Then we saw multiple phases in which the Ukrainians 
 They could effectively resume part of this territory, here in Kharkiv, with 
 an offensive operation.

    Yes, if this graph is supposed to relieve my 
 frustration, it is only a work species. (Laughs.) I would call him hesitation. 
 The United States response has been hesitant. I think, without charity, I know 
 I could say that we have been to play while Rome burns. We have been 
 debating among us, exactly what a small weapons system 
 It will lead to the top or not now for two years. And I think Mike is right.

    There is a cube of that. And then partially self -centered. 
 And the autodisuasion piece is this constant to convince ourselves of 
 that if we provide the next system or additional capacity, then that will be what 
 that tilts Russia to expand the conflict. It simply has not happened. 
 Russia as interested as we are restricted to Ukraine. AND

 A great job here. In the CSIS, I know that some of our colleagues in 
 Washington have also done so that the types of weapons you need in a 
 fight in the Pacific are very different than the weapons that are needed in a

    Can I participate in this? This is a really table 
 interesting. So you know, order of magnitude, something like 10,000 
 Jabalinas, that makes sense. That is the anti -tank missile you need. He 
 Abrams tank number. However, or with patriot batteries, that's 
 ridiculous. I mean, and the problem is that we tell ourselves, oh, 
 Well, we have given you, you know, high -end aerial defenses, the Patriots. 
 But a battery? Thirty -one tanks? By the way, we have hundreds of 
 stored abrams tanks. These are Abrams's old model. They are not the 
 that our soldiers use. They're available. They could have gone there 
 a long time. And I think it is reflected as a failure what to think: we have not 
 managed to think with the proper urgency level. I agree with Mike and 
 Emily in that. But we have not managed to think about the correct scale.

    My former boss Mike Vickers also said that. (Laughter.) 
 I want to return to a point, Emily, who did - you raised the perspective of

 forget or not realize that when it comes to the Russians, you know, the

 Where do Russians get help? And for those who want to focus or

    Yes, frankly, I think it's mainly a track

 To what extent and how Europeans and high -level war are useful, for

 Naval capacities, including anti -submarine war. That takes you out of the problem 
 of the percentage. And much more to the capabilities to perform operations.

   Yes. So it's 
 When I take away my indignant politician and put my hat of 
 Impartial analyst, or at least I do my best to do it. If you see 
 The linear analysis of where this conflict is directed, we must think that Russia 
 He will try to take advantage of his advantage in men and possibly power of 
 fire, although we have an intense debate about who will have the advantage in 
 firepower. But they continue to throw metal and people in the problem.

   You have to think that Ukraine will be trapped in this 
 defensive position for at least next year, while trying to discover 
 Some fundamental things and a reassessment of the strategy. So, 
 Looking, you know, what are you doing? To gather the labor you need to face 
 To the Russians? What do you do with mandatory military service or not? What do you do to 
 Try to obtain this hodgepodge of different materials they have and 
 combine it in an effective and coherent combat force. But that's really 
 Inherent to, we are sitting almost still while we try to solve this and

   So what would that evaluation change? Those who

   The first option is that the United States approves the 
 Help package; Europeans do not use that as an opportunity to say 
 "UF" and go back to what they have been. In doing so, they also advance 
 with a huge amount of help; that Ukraine continues to carry the fight to 
 Russians We were talking about surprises before. One of my surprises is the little 
 that the Russian population has really felt the impact of this conflict. If that

 Find a way of choosing subaters differently. I mean, me

   On the Russian side, these are much more likely issues 
 And high impact, could there be roller troops riots? We saw what 
 Unpleasant with the Wagner group. You know, could something like this happen again 
 On a smaller scale along the Russian front lines? Is there one 
 possibility? That at some point in 2025 there will be a fall in the 
 Russian production of ammunition? I think that would change the rules of the game to 
 the conflict if it were really true and if China had not come to 
 save them. And then the real black swan is that something arises from the murder 
 from Navalny, that really becomes some kind of internal disturbance 
 Within Russia that attracts Putin's attention to return to internal problems 
 Russians more than continue the war in Ukraine. You know, the fighter for the 
 Freedom in me really expects that to happen, but I don't see many 
 indications that this can be the way. We go

    Well I think 
 You are probably thinking of some very mundane things. Things like: how 
 Can I simply sustain strength? How can I rotate tired troops? 
 You know, how ... how do I train not only the new troops but also to the 
 new troops as individuals? - Do you know, the Ukrainians have not been so 
 intense as we would be in individual troops training, but in 
 reality what is probably even the most important thing at this time is 
 vitally important. But upper level training of units of 
 Battalions/brigades, training of older states, I think there is much of that. 
 They are thinking clearly: they have created this new command for aerial systems 
 Not beed, get such things to stand up. And I think they 
 - You know, they want to deliberately - the reason why they have clung to 
 Avdiivka because it has some political meaning for them. But I think, as in 
 Bakhmut, who decided that the Russians really bleed, because 
 I think they understand (not everyone in the West do it: that resources 
 Russia are not infinite and that if the Army Dustusia is suffering losses 
 Very large, even among young officers and others. ignition: they will have 
 problems to perform any type of maneuver important operation only 
 because they will not have the officers who can carry out…. Then I think 
 There is that. I think absorbing the new technology that

 2024, in addition to processing

 The world as we believe should be managed. We don't care about freedoms
