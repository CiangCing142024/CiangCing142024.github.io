   The year 2023 was the deadliest
  </a>
  For the repressive forces of the Pakistani state in a decade, losing more than 500 agents and soldiers. The number of insurgences and armed groups operating in the country is very high, with conflicts present at the border with Afghanistan, on the border with Iran, in Baluchistan, etc. Recently have occurred

  This growth in armed activity is being especially intense in the Baluchistan region, where the people fight against the state of Pakistan and against the interests of monopolies. In this region, multiple contradictions are exacerbated, a nation oppressed by imperialism, and Baluchistan where their people fight for their right to work and live in their lands against the large companies plunder of natural resources.

   Mineral resources are enormous and there is a great interest of imperialisms for them:
  </a>
  There is a variety of great value for gold, silver, copper, iron, lithium, etc., etc., in more than 1,600 mines. For example, the Reko DIQ mine represents one of the largest gold and copper reserves in the world, and is owned by the great Yankee monopoly Barrick. Also the Chinese Metallurgical Group Corp (MCC) monopoly is present in the area.

  The Pakistani state obeys its imperialist masters and unleashes repression against the people in Baluchistan. The figures of missing stand out, which

  , they encrypt 23,000 people since 2011. Mobilizations against such state abuse, even if they are peaceful, are repressed with brutality, with retentions for days, torture, etc. False meetings are also a method that organizations denounce for the democratic rights of Baluchistan, with

  But what has highlighted the most is the intense armed insurgency in Baluchistan, and that is threatening the interests of Chinese and Yankees monopolies,
  <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/07/mining-projects-face-security-threats-in-pakistans-balochistan-province/">
   who are pressing the Pakistani government
  </a>
  to increase security in the area, and therefore repression. Several Baluchistan resistance organizations such as the Baluchistan Liberation Front or the Baluchistan Liberation Army have been tildied with terrorists in accordance with the laws of various imperialist powers. During this start of the year there have been numerous armed actions of draft by the armed Baluchí groups.

   At the end of January

  There were three coordinated attacks, including a strong attack on a prison, which eliminated 15 Pakistani agents. A few days ago there was another outstanding action, an attack against a police police station that

  This intense armed activity has marked the elections that were held yesterday. The elections from the outset have been a process that has clearly been directed and executed as a complete farce by the dominant Pakistani and imperialism classes. From the first moment, Imran Khan has been kept out of play with constants and sudden

  . Some media also wanted to see Khan as a progressive or less reactionary alternative than that represented by Nawaz Sharif, but the reality is that he was faithfully committed to

   Protect the interests of Chinese socialimperialism
  </a>
  and suppress the Baluchí people. In addition, Nawaz Sharif's return to the country as a candidate supported by the military, has left the stage for the farce that has taken place on February 8. But the masses broadly distrust the electoral promises of the various candidates who have appeared to the elections and

  </a>
  <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/505973/corruption-spotlight-pakistan-economy-spirals.aspx">
   ón will improve after this new electoral farce.
  </a>
  The truth is that even many of the bourgeois media point to a lack of total transparency, and that everything has been prepared for Sharif to win the elections with the help of the military.
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9c04832a4482ef221ae89662ba7a64cf">
  To this is added the

   deep crisis
  </a>
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/2/7/pakistans-election-can-the-incoming-government-bring-economic-stability">
  </a>
  of bureaucratic capitalism in Pakistan. Economic indicators are entirely dramatic: 40% of the population lives below the poverty threshold; Inflation has grown up to more than 30%. The people clearly see the situation: according to surveys conducted last week, about 70% believe that economic conditions are worsening. On the other hand, the control of Yankee imperialism over the country is also clear if the recent agreement is observed
  <a href="https://time.com/6293769/imf-loan-pakistan/">
   of the International Monetary Fund with Pakistan
  </a>
  , to which he has provided 3,000 million dollars, after having agreed in July an immediate disbursement of 1.2 billion dollars. This economic crisis is part of the crisis of bureaucratic capitalism, which is also expressed in the serious political crisis in the country. Pakistani dominant classes and imperialism, mainly Yankee, seek to stabilize the country with the latest elections and formation of a new government for the State, although in front of them they have the clear distrust of the people. Now another added problem is that most elected candidates are "independent", which means, from Khan's party. But they will not be allowed to form government, since this is only allowed for the parties. The biggest party will be Nawaz Sharif's party, which will form government, but it will be without a majority in Parliament, totally unstable, which will even more sharpening the political crisis in Pakistan.

 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ee7bf425d16b4eca5876b41fac433c3b">
  The general situation as we see is an intense general crisis of bureaucratic capitalism in the region of southern Asia, which specifically in Pakistan, is very intense and has no signs of resolving. The only solution is to completely sweep the origin of the problem, which is imperialism itself and the oppression and exploitation of oppressed peoples in the area.
