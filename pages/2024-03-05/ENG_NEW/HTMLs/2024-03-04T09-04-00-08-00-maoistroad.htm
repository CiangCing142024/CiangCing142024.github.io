    Since the emergence of capitalism, many women were 
 linked to production and were exposed to double exploitation 
 of the system, which pushed them to fight in an organized way in 
 unions with the men of their class and against the power of the 
 capitalists
   </p>
   <p>
    There were hundreds of workers' strikes who, from 
 long before declaring on March 8 as the International Day of the 
 Woman, forged the path of emancipation of the proletarian woman of the 
 exploitation yoke.
   </p>
   <p>
    In recent years, the world has witnessed the upward trend 
  In the fight of female mass movements by multiple 
 claims and that, in general, condense the struggle of women 
 against the most macho and reactionary expression of the entire system 
 Political and economic prevailing: the second and last phase imperialism 
 of decomposition capitalism.
   </p>
   <p>
    In many cases women have taken the streets and squares, such as 
 part of the daily struggle against conditions of oppression and misery 
 that capitalists impose on the entire working class; In others, against 
  vulgar, sexual, criminal and reactionary violence that the genre commits 
 male against women; and against the open 
 discrimination that the bourgeoisie exercises from its institutions.
   </p>
   <p>
    From the academic, intellectual and institutional environments of the 
 bourgeoisie has responded to this struggle with the promise of adopting 
 measures to guarantee "gender equality"; Under this sophism 
 It aims to make women believe - especially women 
 proletarian - that imperialist capitalism - their states and 
 institutions - can adopt measures to reform itself and carry 
  To society at a point where I guaranteed the end of all inequality 
  social and gender inequality.

   <p>
    Every so often that false promise is signed as a commitment to the 
 capitalists, as did for example with the 17 objectives of 
 Sustainable Development (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda. According to the first objective, 
  they aspired to end poverty in all their forms and that all 
 women and men have the same rights to the use of 
 economic resources, to access to basic services, property, 
  Earth control and other forms of property. Of course, it is not 
 It is true that they fight for it! According to Antonio Guterres, general secretary 
 of the UN: «Achieving gender equality will take 300 years to the rhythm 
 current".
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, the end of poverty and inequality between men and 
 women will not come from the goodwill of the capitalists themselves; to the 
 Contrary to what is promised that by 2030 approximately 830 
  % of the worldwide female population in extreme poverty, which 
 corresponds to more than 340 million girls and women, and almost 25 % 
 (236 million women and girls) will go hungry or deficiency 
 Food
   </p>
   <p>
    In the last 20 years, women's access to employment, 
 working conditions and income differences to varied very little. 
  According to the ILO, in the so -called "developing countries", 
 women who cannot find a job reach 24.9 %, while 
 Unemployed men in those same countries are 16.6 %. In 
 Colombia, of the 1.5 million lost jobs in 2020 
 They recovered 403,000 in 2021 and only 157,000 were occupied by 
 women. Although there was some job recovery at the end of 2021, 
 The unemployment rate closed by 13.7 %, managing to replace only around 
  of 2 percentage points compared to 2020.
   </p>
   <p>
    In terms of salary gaps worldwide, women 
 They cross a terrible situation, earning only 51 cents for 
  every dollar that men perceive. This great margin not only 
 attributes to the high female unemployment rates, but also to the 
 fact that, on average, women receive lower income when 
  They are used. These conditions worsened during the first 
 semester of 2020, with the destruction of jobs, and that 
 reached the highest rate in recent history, according to the bank 
 Inter -American Development (IDB), and that severely affected the 
 women.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the Colombian context, the salary gap between men and women 
  It is worrying, since women receive approximately $ 300,000 
  less than men. According to Dane (2019), this salary gap 
 general was 12.9 %, which means that, for every 100 pesos that a 
 Man won in total labor income, a woman received 87.1 
 pesos. In addition, the wage gap per hour for 2019 was -2.3 %, 
 indicating that, although women earn more per hour on average, their 
 Total income is lower because women allocate on average 41 
 weekly hours to paid work, in contrast to 49 hours 
 average men.
   </p>
   <p>
    This means that, to the low salaries that the class receives 
 Worker in general, women must support a decrease in their 
 income for attending unpaid work, which is none other than 
 tasks that most women in their homes must do to 
 guarantee the reproduction of the workforce, and that must 
 The capitalists demanded in the general wage increase.
    <code>

   </p>
   <p>
    The double moral of the capitalists serves to get the maximum 
 benefit at the expense of proletarian women in the world. On one side, 
  justify the salary gap between men and women as a product of 
 the "occupational segregation" that justifies that professions and 
 trades exercised and preferred by women receive less remuneration 
 that those of men, thus require the same level of training and 
 ability that other "male professions"; that is, capitalism 
 Kake women for choosing low salaries.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition, according to capitalists, difficulties in satisfying 
 demand for employment of women are due to the trend of women and 
  to your need to choose jobs with "flexible modalities" (access to 
  nursery, short distances between work and home, costs and 
 hours of transport), because "the social norm" imposes on the woman the women 
 domestic responsibilities, on the other hand, in the case of men these 
  They do not have to give up more hours of work and, therefore, not 
 They sacrifice up to 20 % of their economic income.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the other hand, the capitalist system, for more "good intentions" 
 of some little girls who intend to give a human varnish to 
 This bloodthirsty system advances in its collapse process, worsening 
 The working conditions of the entire working class, generating the 
 degradation of society and the extension of wage slavery, 
 pure and hard slavery. According to the ILO between 2016 and 2021 there was a 
 increase of 2.7 million people submitted to forced labor, 
 which meant that by 2021, forty -nine million six hundred 
 A thousand people lived in modern slavery conditions; of course, 
 The women of the working class receive the worst part.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we concentrate in Colombia, the panorama is no more encouraging. Tough 
  to recent ads to have reduced unemployment to 9.3 % (which 
 The bourgeoisie statesmen call "unemployment"); his excitement for 
 Bringing this percentage to a single digit is not so significant if 
 We consider that, from 23 cities and metropolitan areas, only 6 arrived 
  Really at a single digit, the others remain above 10 % 
 of "unemployment" being Quibdó and Riohacha the cities with the elderly 
 unemployment rates with 23.8 % and 13.8 %, respectively.
   </p>
   <p>
    Likewise, the national total unemployment rate in November 2023 
  For women it was 11.1 %, and that of men of 7.4 %. 
 They celebrate the supposed reduction of the gap to 3.7 percentage points, 
 but in November 2023 the occupation rate at the national level reached 
  58.3 %, with a national occupation rate of 70.7 % and 
 that of women 46.7 %. Then, shut up on the 24 points 
 percentage of the gap in the percentage of occupation.
   </p>
   <p>
    In 2024 capitalists advance more ferocity to squeeze 
 The life of the entire working class, especially that of women 
 forcing them to endure the exacerbation of conditions: the loud 
 of life, the reduction of salaries, dismissals, persistence of 
 broad salary gaps, condemnation of the informal economy of 
 subsistence, difficulties in accessing formal jobs and well 
 remunerated. All these conditions are used by 
 capitalists, while pushing the working class towards degradation 
 moral and women are condemned to the bestialities of machismo.
   </p>
   <p>
    Cases such as those of vancamp´s tuna workers, who “take for 
 Surprise »to the Minister of Labor, they are significantly generalized 
  throughout the industry, especially in the sectors where it is hired 
 Female labor: manufacturing industry, flowers, 
 Confections, health, accommodation, food preparation, 
 cleaning services ... generalized are also the complaints of 
 women and their trade union organizations ranging from the 
 discount and salary sales for going to the bathroom in several companies of the 
  country, as workers from cleaning unions report in Bogotá, 
 They go through ignorance of occupational diseases, dismissals without fair 
 cause for being a member of the union organization as reported 
 Sintraime Santander in January of this year with a rally against the 
 Cetelsa by Nesan factory and get to work and sexual harassment by 
 part of the supervisors, as Sintraquim denounced in Cali the year 
 After the dismissal of several companions who did not remain silent 
 Before harassment.
   </p>
   <p>
    In recent years, women - particularly unionists - 
 They have been victims of different forms of discrimination, exclusion and 
 Violence: sexual, economic and anti -indical. All this is a consequence 
 of the oppression of the capitalists over the entire working class and that 
 doubly affects proletarian women. Therefore, the conquest of 
 the gender equality of which the bourgeoisie and the little 
 bourgeoisie, will not come from the common struggle of women of all 
 classes for the reform of the bourgeois system, nor will it be the result of a 
 Exclusive fight against male sex and its privileged position.
   </p>
   <p>
    The communists are convinced that true emancipation 
 The woman can only be done, as the comrade Clara Zetkin said: 
  «Through the common struggle of women and men of the proletariat 
 exploited against privileges, the power of men and women 
 of the possessing and exploiting classes ».
   </p>
   <p>
    For all this we believe it is necessary to call all women and 
 men of the working people, who just claim all their 
 rights, to be joined to the ranks of the revolutionaries and 
 Let's prepare a
    <strong>
     March 8 International Women's Day, Combative and Revolutionary
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    We call the leaders and activists of trade union organizations and 
  of masses to develop an extensive work of propaganda, education and 
 organization among working women, youth, students, 
 unemployed and join both men and women of the working class in a 
 great mobilization day, in a
    <strong>
     March 8 International Women's Day, Combative and Revolutionary
    </strong>
    in 
  who, in addition to lifting general and immediate claims 
 that concern the entire working class (for lowering and freezing the prices of 
  The family basket, public services and gasoline, on the rise 
 General of wages, subsidy to unemployed and underemployed, by 
 formal employment, job stability and end the outsourcing and 
 labor intermediation ...) lift together - men and women— 
 claims that in particular interest women:
   </p>
   <p>
    • Guarantee the abortion assisted free of free by the State
    <br/>
    • Prevention and punishment measures to any act of verbal, psychological or physical violence
    <br/>
    • Special treatment for pregnant women and infants
    <br/>
    • Real equality of wages and promotion to management positions in all areas
    <br/>
    • Women's user use
    <br/>
    • Expansion of diurnal and nocturnal nurseries
   </p>
   <p>
    Claims that generally respond to the class interests of the proletariat and its allies of the poor peasantry.
   </p>
   <p>
    The communists are convinced that strengthening and unleashing the 
 Women's fight within the fighting of the labor movement 
 represents a significant advance for faster and more progress 
 strong of the labor movement and for a rapid transformation of the 
 existing social conditions.
   </p>
   <p>
    «The emancipation struggle of proletarian woman cannot be a 
 fight similar to what the bourgeois woman develops against the man of 
 his class; On the contrary, his is a fight that is linked to that of 
 Man of his class against the class of the capitalists. She, the woman 
 proletarian, does not need to fight the men of their class to 
 Draft the barriers that free concurrence has raised.
    <strong>
     The proletarian woman fights side by side with the man of her class against capitalist society. Clara Zetkin
