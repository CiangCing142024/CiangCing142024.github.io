  About 100,000 people were affected by a historic flood in Acre in late February. The National Secretariat of Protection and Civil Defense (SEDEC) put 17 of the 22 Acre cities in emergency on February 25. For years plans for flood prevention have been allegedly assembled in the region, but never leave the paper. On February 27, 340 people were homeless and 127 homeless.
 </p>
 <p>
  The flood began in Assis Brasil with the flood of the Acre River basin. In a short time there were the floods of the streams in Rio Branco, followed by the flood of the Acre River, which impacted Rio Branco, Assis Brasil, Brasileia, Epitaciolândia, Porto Acre, Placido de Castro, Capixaba, Xapuri, South Cruise, Seine Madureira, Feijó , Tarauacá, Santa Rosa, Jordan, Marshal Thaumaturgo, Porto Walter and Mâncio Lima.
 </p>
 <p>
  On February 28, Rio Acre reached the 15.56 meter mark in the municipality of Brasiléia, surpassing the historic flood of 2015. At that time, the river reached 15.55m. About 75% of the city is affected. The locomotion is only possible through river as the earth's way is isolated. Already in the capital, Rio Branco, the river hit 16.82 meters.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Plans do not leave the paper
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2020, the city hall conducted a survey with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM), exposing that in 52 years of monitoring, the capital of Acre had recorded 41 floods of the Acre River.
 </p>
 <p>
  The survey conducted four years ago aimed to build a plan to face climate and environmental change, but never left the paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the research, Acre underwent large floods in the year 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. In all, these episodes, the poor were the most affected, especially villages of riverside peasants. Rural and indigenous areas are also affected.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even so, the state follows without solid planning for flood prevention.
