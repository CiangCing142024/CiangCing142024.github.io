This is the third protest in the region against the installation of the roads on the roads, which have the bidding of the company Caminhos da Serra Gaucha (CSG).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The concentration of protesters began in the morning at 9am. A huge police apparatus was mobilized to try to intimidate protesters. In contrast, drivers who were going through the journey honored frequently in support of the mobilization.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The toll, which will start operating this month, has the value of R $ 12.30 in both directions, and without exemption to the majority of the city's population, except for residents of only 3 neighborhoods of the municipality closer to the toll. For the Valley of Happiness region, where most people have to move to work to large cities such as Montenegro and Novo Hamburgo, the climate is of indignation and deep distrust in the municipalities and state government.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/rs-moradores-de-capela-de-santana-bloqueiam-estrada-em-protesto-contra-a-instalacao-de-pedagios-abusivos/\">\n   In February, the population of Capela de Santana, a neighboring city, blocked the highway\n  </a>\n  In repudiation of the installation of other tolls of the same company in the region, citing abusive prices that many residents simply cannot afford.
