<p>
    Since the emergence of capitalism, many women were 
 linked to production and were exposed to double exploitation 
 of the system, which pushed them to fight in an organized way in 
 unions with the men of their class and against the power of the 
 capitalists
   </p>
<p>
    There were hundreds of workers' strikes who, from 
 long before declaring on March 8 as the International Day of the 
 Woman, forged the path of emancipation of the proletarian woman of the 
 exploitation yoke.
   </p>
<p>
    In recent years, the world has witnessed the upward trend 
  In the fight of female mass movements by multiple 
 claims and that, in general, condense the struggle of women 
 against the most macho and reactionary expression of the entire system 
 Political and economic prevailing: the second and last phase imperialism 
 of decomposition capitalism.
   </p>
<p>
    In many cases women have taken the streets and squares, such as 
 part of the daily struggle against conditions of oppression and misery 
 that capitalists impose on the entire working class; In others, against 
  vulgar, sexual, criminal and reactionary violence that the genre commits 
 male against women; and against the open 
 discrimination that the bourgeoisie exercises from its institutions.
   </p>
<p>
    From the academic, intellectual and institutional environments of the 
 bourgeoisie has responded to this struggle with the promise of adopting 
 measures to guarantee "gender equality"; Under this sophism 
 It aims to make women believe - especially women 
 proletarian - that imperialist capitalism - their states and 
 institutions - can adopt measures to reform itself and carry 
  To society at a point where I guaranteed the end of all inequality 
  social and gender inequality.
    <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Every so often that false promise is signed as a commitment to the 
 capitalists, as did for example with the 17 objectives of 
 Sustainable Development (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda. According to the first objective, 
  they aspired to end poverty in all their forms and that all 
 women and men have the same rights to the use of 
 economic resources, to access to basic services, property, 
  Earth control and other forms of property. Of course, it is not 
 It is true that they fight for it! According to Antonio Guterres, general secretary 
 of the UN: «Achieving gender equality will take 300 years to the rhythm 
 current".
   </p>
<p>
    Thus, the end of poverty and inequality between men and 
 women will not come from the goodwill of the capitalists themselves; to the 
 Contrary to what is promised that by 2030 approximately 830 
  % of the worldwide female population in extreme poverty, which 
 corresponds to more than 340 million girls and women, and almost 25 % 
 (236 million women and girls) will go hungry or deficiency 
 Food
   </p>
<p>
    In the last 20 years, women's access to employment, 
 working conditions and income differences to varied very little. 
  According to the ILO, in the so -called "developing countries", 
 women who cannot find a job reach 24.9 %, while 
 Unemployed men in those same countries are 16.6 %. In 
 Colombia, of the 1.5 million lost jobs in 2020 
 They recovered 403,000 in 2021 and only 157,000 were occupied by 
 women. Although there was some job recovery at the end of 2021, 
 The unemployment rate closed by 13.7 %, managing to replace only around 
  of 2 percentage points compared to 2020.
   </p>
<p>
    In terms of salary gaps worldwide, women 
 They cross a terrible situation, earning only 51 cents for 
  every dollar that men perceive. This great margin not only 
 attributes to the high female unemployment rates, but also to the 
 fact that, on average, women receive lower income when 
  They are used. These conditions worsened during the first 
 semester of 2020, with the destruction of jobs, and that 
 reached the highest rate in recent history, according to the bank 
 Inter -American Development (IDB), and that severely affected the 
 women.
   </p>
<p>
    In the Colombian context, the salary gap between men and women 
  It is worrying, since women receive approximately $ 300,000 
  less than men. According to Dane (2019), this salary gap 
 general was 12.9 %, which means that, for every 100 pesos that a 
 Man won in total labor income, a woman received 87.1 
 pesos. In addition, the wage gap per hour for 2019 was -2.3 %, 
 indicating that, although women earn more per hour on average, their 
 Total income is lower because women allocate on average 41 
 weekly hours to paid work, in contrast to 49 hours 
 average men.
   </p>
<p>
    This means that, to the low salaries that the class receives 
 Worker in general, women must support a decrease in their 
 income for attending unpaid work, which is none other than 
 tasks that most women in their homes must do to 
 guarantee the reproduction of the workforce, and that must 
 The capitalists demanded in the general wage increase.
    <code>
     1
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    The double moral of the capitalists serves to get the maximum 
 benefit at the expense of proletarian women in the world. On one side, 
  justify the salary gap between men and women as a product of 
 the "occupational segregation" that justifies that professions and 
 trades exercised and preferred by women receive less remuneration 
 that those of men, thus require the same level of training and 
 ability that other "male professions"; that is, capitalism 
 Kake women for choosing low salaries.
   </p>
<p>
    In addition, according to capitalists, difficulties in satisfying 
 demand for employment of women are due to the trend of women and 
  to your need to choose jobs with "flexible modalities" (access to 
  nursery, short distances between work and home, costs and 
 hours of transport), because "the social norm" imposes on the woman the women 
 domestic responsibilities, on the other hand, in the case of men these 
  They do not have to give up more hours of work and, therefore, not 
 They sacrifice up to 20 % of their economic income.
   </p>
<p>
    On the other hand, the capitalist system, for more "good intentions" 
 of some little girls who intend to give a human varnish to 
 This bloodthirsty system advances in its collapse process, worsening 
 The working conditions of the entire working class, generating the 
 degradation of society and the extension of wage slavery, 
 pure and hard slavery. According to the ILO between 2016 and 2021 there was a 
 increase of 2.7 million people submitted to forced labor, 
 which meant that by 2021, forty -nine million six hundred 
 A thousand people lived in modern slavery conditions; of course, 
 The women of the working class receive the worst part.
   </p>
<p>
    If we concentrate in Colombia, the panorama is no more encouraging. Tough 
  to recent ads to have reduced unemployment to 9.3 % (which 
 The bourgeoisie statesmen call "unemployment"); his excitement for 
 Bringing this percentage to a single digit is not so significant if 
 We consider that, from 23 cities and metropolitan areas, only 6 arrived 
  Really at a single digit, the others remain above 10 % 
 of "unemployment" being Quibdó and Riohacha the cities with the elderly 
 unemployment rates with 23.8 % and 13.8 %, respectively.
   </p>
<p>
    Likewise, the national total unemployment rate in November 2023 
  For women it was 11.1 %, and that of men of 7.4 %. 
 They celebrate the supposed reduction of the gap to 3.7 percentage points, 
 but in November 2023 the occupation rate at the national level reached 
  58.3 %, with a national occupation rate of 70.7 % and 
 that of women 46.7 %. Then, shut up on the 24 points 
 percentage of the gap in the percentage of occupation.
   </p>
<p>
    In 2024 capitalists advance more ferocity to squeeze 
 The life of the entire working class, especially that of women 
 forcing them to endure the exacerbation of conditions: the loud 
 of life, the reduction of salaries, dismissals, persistence of 
 broad salary gaps, condemnation of the informal economy of 
 subsistence, difficulties in accessing formal jobs and well 
 remunerated. All these conditions are used by 
 capitalists, while pushing the working class towards degradation 
 moral and women are condemned to the bestialities of machismo.
   </p>
<p>
    Cases such as those of vancamp´s tuna workers, who “take for 
 Surprise »to the Minister of Labor, they are significantly generalized 
  throughout the industry, especially in the sectors where it is hired 
 Female labor: manufacturing industry, flowers, 
 Confections, health, accommodation, food preparation, 
 cleaning services ... generalized are also the complaints of 
 women and their trade union organizations ranging from the 
 discount and salary sales for going to the bathroom in several companies of the 
  country, as workers from cleaning unions report in Bogotá, 
 They go through ignorance of occupational diseases, dismissals without fair 
 cause for being a member of the union organization as reported 
 Sintraime Santander in January of this year with a rally against the 
 Cetelsa by Nesan factory and get to work and sexual harassment by 
 part of the supervisors, as Sintraquim denounced in Cali the year 
 After the dismissal of several companions who did not remain silent 
 Before harassment.
   </p>
<p>
    In recent years, women - particularly unionists - 
 They have been victims of different forms of discrimination, exclusion and 
 Violence: sexual, economic and anti -indical. All this is a consequence 
 of the oppression of the capitalists over the entire working class and that 
 doubly affects proletarian women. Therefore, the conquest of 
 the gender equality of which the bourgeoisie and the little 
 bourgeoisie, will not come from the common struggle of women of all 
 classes for the reform of the bourgeois system, nor will it be the result of a 
 Exclusive fight against male sex and its privileged position.
   </p>
<p>
    The communists are convinced that true emancipation 
 The woman can only be done, as the comrade Clara Zetkin said: 
  «Through the common struggle of women and men of the proletariat 
 exploited against privileges, the power of men and women 
 of the possessing and exploiting classes ».
   </p>
<p>
    For all this we believe it is necessary to call all women and 
 men of the working people, who just claim all their 
 rights, to be joined to the ranks of the revolutionaries and 
 Let's prepare a
    <strong>
     March 8 International Women's Day, Combative and Revolutionary
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
<p>
    We call the leaders and activists of trade union organizations and 
  of masses to develop an extensive work of propaganda, education and 
 organization among working women, youth, students, 
 unemployed and join both men and women of the working class in a 
 great mobilization day, in a
    <strong>
     March 8 International Women's Day, Combative and Revolutionary
    </strong>
    in 
  who, in addition to lifting general and immediate claims 
 that concern the entire working class (for lowering and freezing the prices of 
  The family basket, public services and gasoline, on the rise 
 General of wages, subsidy to unemployed and underemployed, by 
 formal employment, job stability and end the outsourcing and 
 labor intermediation ...) lift together - men and women— 
 claims that in particular interest women:
   </p>
<p>
    • Guarantee the abortion assisted free of free by the State
    <br>
    • Prevention and punishment measures to any act of verbal, psychological or physical violence
    <br>
    • Special treatment for pregnant women and infants
    <br/>
    • Real equality of wages and promotion to management positions in all areas
    <br/>
    • Women's user use
    <br/>
    • Expansion of diurnal and nocturnal nurseries
   </br></br></p>
<p>
    Claims that generally respond to the class interests of the proletariat and its allies of the poor peasantry.
   </p>
<p>
    The communists are convinced that strengthening and unleashing the 
 Women's fight within the fighting of the labor movement 
 represents a significant advance for faster and more progress 
 strong of the labor movement and for a rapid transformation of the 
 existing social conditions.
   </p>
<p>
    «The emancipation struggle of proletarian woman cannot be a 
 fight similar to what the bourgeois woman develops against the man of 
 his class; On the contrary, his is a fight that is linked to that of 
 Man of his class against the class of the capitalists. She, the woman 
 proletarian, does not need to fight the men of their class to 
 Draft the barriers that free concurrence has raised.
    <strong>
     The proletarian woman fights side by side with the man of her class against capitalist society. Clara Zetkin

  High-ranked officers resigned the Israeli Army spokesman team due to the ongoing war in Gaza, according to the Israeli press.

<p>
  “The second in command of Daniel Hagari's team, Moran Katz, along with many high -ranking officers, presented their layoffs in the light of the conflict in Gaza,”

<p>
  The list of employees who also resigned also includes Lieutenant Colonel Merav Granot Stoller and Lieutenant Colonel Tzupia Moshkovich. The latter, according to the report, “was in charge of the Shayetet 13 unit” before Hagari's appointment.

  The report indicates that Hagari was "appointed to the position of FDI spokesman without having previously performed any communication function in the unit" and that "its connections with former cabinet chiefs identified with a particular political party raise some questions." In fact, according to channel 14, Hagari served as assistant of Gadi Eisenkot and Benny Gantz.

  Israelite aggression also resulted in the forced travel of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of forced displaced people to move to the densely populated city of Rafah in the south, near the Egyptian border- in the one that became the largest city in Palestine. mass exodus since Nakba 1948.

  Israel states that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during Operation Flood of Al-AQSA on October 7. The Israeli press published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed that day for "friendly fire."

   In
all previous years, the dominant imperialist powers in the European
Union have consolidated the exploitation and plundering of the
peoples and workers in the countries of Europe. Extreme austerity
policies have been implemented, the poor and middle classes have been
squeezed with salary cuts and the attack on their labour rights, and
the peasants have seen the onset of the CAP policy that targets them.
Youth continued to be at the centre of the attack with European
policies striking at studies and labour rights; additionally, not
only did the Bologna policies not bring better days for young people
studying, but it worsened the conditions of studying and even forced
many students to abandon education. Working youth, poor working class
youth, those living on the fringes of poverty, migrants and
“second-class citizens” as they are called, have been dealt a
severe blow. On one hand they were the first to accept the measures
of cuts and austerity; on the other hand they saw their democratic
rights being overturned.

   In
all the developments of recent years, the EU is once again emerging
as a force that supports and participates in unjust wars, a force
responsible for the slaughter of peoples. The unjust war in Ukraine,
apart from the stamp of the imperialists of Russia and the USA, also
bears the stamp of EU’s intervention and support of fascist and
far-right groups. At the same time, the ongoing ethnic cleansing of
the Palestinian people has the support of the forces of the European
Union. The repression and the ban on the mobilizations of solidarity
to the Palestinian people is the primary direction of the EU
countries. The decision of the European Parliament -by an
overwhelming majority- to recognise "Israel's right to
self-defence" while there is a prolonged massacre in Gaza of a
people living for years under the occupation of the fascist state of
Israel is an obvious example of how democratic and humanitarian the
EU edifice is. It is clear that solidarity with the Palestinian
people and the struggle for freedom in Palestine means abstaining
from the war-mongering EU edifice and abstaining from the European
elections.

   The
policies of extreme racism, the rise of far-right parties in the
countries of the European Union and in the European Parliament are
supported by and underpin the reactionary, racist and anti-communist
policies of the main systemic forces. New forces have emerged and old
forces have been strengthened, which represent the extremes of
capitalism, exploitation and social, ethnic, religious, cultural and
gender discrimination. All this ideological and political offensive
that has proceeded in parallel with the attack on the rights and
conquests of decades was necessary for the imperialist bourgeoisies
of the EU. It was needed to put the workers and the oppressed in the
spotlight and put the blame for the ongoing crisis on them. These
far-right and fascist policies not only do not oppose the EU but are
its “flesh and blood”. This is the political perception of the
capitalist imperialist system which manifests itself when it is in
crisis or in danger.

   The
myth of “Europe of the peoples”, of the social-human face of the
European Union is now showing its true face. The face of war,
exploitation and barbarism. The face of imperialism-capitalism which
is only interested in the reproduction of its profits and its
political supremacy over its opponents. It is obvious to anyone who
wants to see it that a handful of imperialist countries are running
the EU. They are promoting the exploitation of the bourgeoisie
against all the other peoples’ and working classes and at the same
time they are squeezing the wealth out of the remaining dependent
countries. This is the reality of the European Union. A union
dominated by contradictions and antagonism, a union that is doomed to
fail.

   This
rotten and exploitative edifice also needs the semblance of democracy
to be sold to the people. It needs the European Parliament to work to
disorientate the people and convince them that it can be changed and
fixed. But the truth is that the European Parliament is a puppet
without any meaningful and decisive functions, a spectacle set up to
deceive the peoples of Europe and to distract them from their
struggle. It is a “greenhouse” where the system's lobbies grow,
in which the only thing the so-called MEPs obey to is the “money
bags” available to the capitalists to promote their interests
inside and outside the EU.

the peasants like recently in France and Greece. The continuation and
the path towards justice for the workers' and peoples’ struggles
does not go through the acceptance of the miserable illusions about
the European Parliament and the EU. The working peoples’

  The Federal Prosecutor's Office considered the evidence against the four young peasants of Rondônia. The activists participated in the taking of Santa Elina Farm, the scene of the Battle of Corumbiara, and had been arrested by the PM of Rondônia on May 14, 2021, accused of illegal gun and radio transmitters during an illegal operation against the camp. At the time, the League of Poor Peasants characterized the arrest as political persecution, denouncing that the only source for the legal process was testimonials of military police.
 </p>
<p>
  At the time, the PM of Rondônia was directed by José Hélio Cysneiros Pachá (known as “The Holy Elina Carnage”) chosen by the Bolly Churcher Governor Colonel Marcos Rocha. Popular movements and lawyers denounced that the intentions of the government of Rondônia was to repress and take revenge on the peasant struggle and those activists who participated in the historic camp Manoel Ribeiro.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Lawyers Association gives acquittal details
 </h4>
<p>
  The Brazilian People's Lawyers Association Gabriel Pimenta (Abrapo) stated that the Federal Public Prosecution Service corroborated the defense's theses, considering doubtful and contradictory the evidence against young people, and decided to acquit the four activists (three peasants and one student of Unir) .
 </p>
<p>
  Abrapo also explains that in the analysis of the proof, the MPF and the Federal Criminal Court ridiculed the evidence of the flagrant (possession of weapon and possession of communicating radios). The defense denounced that the weapon found with the four was a blatant forged by the police to criminalize the struggle for the land, but had not had any analysis by the judiciary. In addition to ignoring the illegality that the only witness heard was the police themselves, the weapon that was allegedly in possession of one of the activists was used to convict activists in state courts.
 </p>
<p>
  With the new understanding of the MPF, it will be possible to question the conviction, requesting a criminal review that Abrapo considers “quite promising”.

  It concludes by stating that "this is an important victory for the collective struggle, the lawyers of the people, Abrapo, Cebraspo, newspaper and, and all the supporters of the struggle for the land for those who live and work in it."

<b>
   Declaration of Georges Abdallah, political prisoner in France, read in Marseille on February 25, 2024.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Dear friends, dear companions,
 </p>
<p>
  For over four and a half months, the Palestinian people, through all its social and political components, have been facing a massive genocidal aggression to Gaza and military operations no less deadly in the West Bank, where supremacy colonists and soldiers of the employment army abandon themselves daily to the worst excesses, with the aim of intensifying colonization and making life conditions unbearable for the majority of popular masses.
 </p>
<p>
  Arbitrary arrests, killings of activists, destruction of houses and other abuses are becoming increasingly the daily fate of all the Palestinians in the West Bank.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, the imperialist states of the West lift, in one way or another, with the Zionist entity, orchestrale a propaganda campaign, justifying and supporting this criminal Zionist war, denigrating the main forces that oppose it all day And, above all, criminalizing here any initiative to support the struggle of the Palestinian popular masses and their fighters' avant -garde.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialist bourgeoisie of this country, just as he celebrates the entry to the Panthéon of a heroic figure of the anti -fascist resistance (Missak Manuchian, Ndt), invokes, with all the shame, the "right of self -defense" of the occupant Zionist in the face of the Resistance of the Palestinian national movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Few voices in social -democratic intelligence remind the system guard dogs that the colonialist occupant has no legitimacy. The occupation and the army of employment, with everything that brings with it, are completely illegitimate. On the other hand, the occupant resistance in all its forms is the most legitimate and noble expression of the "right of peoples to self -determination".
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, it is very difficult to conceive this legitimacy when a special place has been preserved in your head for Marshal Pétain or for another no less execrable Marshal Bugeaud ...
 </p>
<p>
  Having said that, dear friends and companions, perhaps it would be useful to remember that active international solidarity is an indispensable weapon in the fight against the colonization of Palestine and the genocidal war that is intimately linked to it. It is on the basis of this active solidarity that we can participate in the change of strength relationships here, in the belly of the imperialist beast, and elsewhere, in the process of building the "historical social block", a global and potential subject of the national liberation movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, not ignored that it was thanks to your active and solidarity mobilization that the "power agents" of capital have been forced to sell and revoke the ban on manifesting in solidarity with the Palestinian people.
 </p>
<p>
  In other words, despite the entire process of fascisting in progress in this country, the simple fact of mobilizing in solidarity on the international scene contributes, in a sense, to the strengthening of the "convergence of struggles" and to the structuring of the "historical social blockade "In view of taking his role as an active political subject.
 </p>
<p>
  If the imperialist bourgeoisie celebrates in these days the Pantheonization of Manouchian immediately after approving the "immigration law", it is because it mainly tries to erase and bury the values embodied by the struggle and martyrdom of all resistance fighters as a hand.
 </p>
<p>
  Dear friends, dear companions, from the beginning of the twentieth century to today, the Palestinian people have never stopped fighting the Zionist in settlement project. Several decades of struggle, sacrifice and suffering have shaped the Palestinian identity up to the marrow. The thousands of martyrs and prisoners and the hundreds of refugees in the fields, in Palestine and in the neighboring countries, have contributed to considerably complicating the existential conditions of the Palestinian people and consequently the objective conditions of its resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, it is only in the general framework of this "historical resistance" that the construction of the anti -medical political subject flourish and bloom, and it is precisely in this context that we can better grasp the dynamic articulation of its components and the various factors that structure the "will collective "to promote the anti -colonial, anti -medical and anti -imperialist action.
 </p>
<p>
  It is only in light of all this that today we can understand why "Palestine can only win", despite what at first glance appears as a huge imbalance in strength relationships: on the one hand there is the Zionist entity, organic extension of Western imperialism, and on the other the Palestinian popular masses who, for more than a century, have been people and continue to do so today, in the dynamics of a struggle whose place in play goes far beyond the boundaries of historical Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  These people, who had to take the tasks historically due to all the Arab masses, in particular to those of the Arabic mashrek, found himself for more than a century in the grip of a particular type of colonial settlement, which prevented him from being socially being structured, Like any other population of the region, through the dialectic of the class struggle in a traditional way of colonial production.
 </p>
<p>
  These people defeated the entire colonial settlement policy implemented for over a century by the Zionist expression of the imperialist West. The ethnic cleaning of the land of Palestine and its indomitable inhabitants is more than a failure. More than half of the Palestinian people live today in historical Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  The Zionist movement has never succeeded and will never be able to break the unshakable will of Palestinian women and men, young and old, to conduct the struggle on all fronts to free Palestine, all of Palestine. It is this historical resistance, deeply rooted in the collective memory, which constantly revives the Palestinian identity.
 </p>
<p>
  Dear friends, dear companions, despite the genocidal aggression on a massive scale against Gaza of these days, in which the tens and tens of thousands of martyrs and injuries have been added to the terrible widespread destruction of the entire living space of Gaza, the resistance remains Unexable, protected and embraced by popular masses.
 </p>
<p>
  Gaza will never bring the white flag of the surrender ... neither the Zionists nor any criminal force will ever be able to break the will of the resistance to Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  We must never forget that it is from the bowels of these refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon that the historic Palestinian fighter force has emerged: the Fedayyìn. Today more than ever, this resistance to the genocidal aggression is alive and brings the promise of the Fedayyin.
 </p>
<p>
  That a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish in support of Palestine and its promising resistance!
 </p>
<p>
  Solidarity, all solidarity, with resistants in Zionist prisons and in isolation in Morocco, Turkey, Greece, Philippines and elsewhere in the world!
 </p>
<p>
  Solidarity, all solidarity, to young proletarians in popular neighborhoods!
 </p>
<p>
  Capitalism is nothing but barbarism, honor to all those who oppose there in the diversity of their expressions!
 </p>
<p>
  Together friends and companions, only together we will win!
 </p>
<p>
  Palestine will live and Palestine will surely win!
 </p>
<p>
  To all of you, companions and friends, my warmest revolutionary greeting.

   We get the next complaint of a company's base worker Recoverar S.A.S. We thank the partner to consider the voice of the exploited and oppressed, because it is. We take the opportunity to invite other workers to send their complaints against all outrage from the exploiters. We have common enemies and we must fight against them, organized and guided by proletarian ideology.

   At the main plant of Recover S.A.S in Itagüí, a company that is dedicated to recycling, workers are facing workplace harassment by supervisors, through the complaint and union representation, and thanks to this, they have avoided that the work recharge increases and the work rhythm.
  </p>
<p>
   In meat food, workers are also doing the same, as they protect themselves from labor abuse of production because they are an obstacle to the employer who seeks to overexploot the workers.

   The workers are acting well when denouncing and defending themselves; However, they must also form activist committees that allow them It seeks to generate fear and intimidation.
  </p>
<p>
   It is also important to link their struggle with others that are pounding their class brothers in other sectors of production or society against salaried slavery.
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore, some activists are promoting a national popular assembly to collect the most felt claims of workers and it is convenient to participate.

   We publish these two news as annexes, which are very vinvulated to be able to make a closer idea in the war front between the Russian imperialist invader and the forces of the Ukrainian national resistance.

   Today we publish transcription 
 Complete of the Center for Strategic and 
 International Studies “Ukraine in the Balance: A Battlefield Update 
 on the war in ukraine ”, which last Friday we publish them 
 incomplete, we also made the mistake of consigning the CSIS as a 
 Yankee Imperialism Institute, when it is from English imperialism 
 As can be seen at the UK publication, this is the kingdom 
 United. We lohico with the rush of time, because we consider that 
 It was very important that our readers conceive, in the opinion of 
 The military and security experts of Yankee imperialism, such as 
 They are Eliot Cohen, former state department advisor, Emily Harding, 
 An intelligence expert of the SCIS that was previously CIA, of the 
 US National Security Council, etc., and Mike Vickers, 
 former Undersecretary of Defense Intelligence, Operations Officer 
 of the CIA.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
<br>
</br></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The importance of the document is that 
 contains the discussion between these experts that represent the 
 interests of one of the factions of Yankee imperialism, that of 
 current Biden government and PD, on how the development of the 
 War from its beginning to date, the stages that according to them carry 
 Tour, until you reach the current moment of the War of positions, 
 With the different terrestrial, aerial and naval bells, where they show the successes and failures, the strengths and weak, etc. 
 From both part, the symbolic importance of the taking of Avdiivka 
 For political development in Russia, linked to the death of Levany, 
 and its limited military value. Make an interesting comparison between 1914 and 2023, where 
 They see great potential for instability and innovation on both sides 
 In this war, his appreciation of the Naval Campana of the Ukraine 
 It is important.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   See how Imperialists focus on their "help" 
 military to impose dependence on the Ukrainian nation, that is 
 get through the back door, while the Ukrainian nation combat 
 the invasion of the aggressive forces of Russian imperialism. I know there 
 reveals his cynicism, when he recognizes that with this "help" 
 They win are their own companies, they say:
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
<br>
</br></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   „(…) The money we spend on 
 Ukraine does not leave the United States to the defense industry of the 
 USA .. You go to US companies that send help to Ukraine. The 
 Vast majority of this stay here. ”
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
<br>
</br></span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   That is double gain.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The interests of the government 
 Imperialist Yankee of Biden are expressed in the opinions of these 
 experiences, among many others, when they talk about the meaning of this 
 War, etc. The statements of the representatives of all imperialist countries regarding war, in terms of "help", sending of armament and threat of being used has or seeks to have an effect on the opinion of the countries involved, in the elections and internal political development , because as reads the second annex and the news about the conversations of German ocial Mass destruction, including the military. Of its proopias conditions and possibility. Especially of the strategic balance at the level of those weapons of the Russian and Yankees imperialists.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Well, above all this we will return more 
 forward. But, we reiterate in reference to the two annexes, in 
 our position on the development of contradictions in this 
 War of aggression of Russian imperialism against the nation 
 Ukraine, in which the main contradiction is oppressed nation 
 Against Russian imperialist aggression war. Than the imperialists 
 In their wars against oppressed nations they can only 
 Coquisote failures and get engaged in the quagmire. That he 
 Yankee Emprialism is the fat dog and the main enemy of the 
 Peoples of the world and Russian imperialism is the skinny dog, such as 
 Aggressive imperialism in Ukraine is the main enemy there.

    However, most analysts are 
 issuing sobering evaluations about Ukraine's perspectives to 
 2024 If you do not receive American help. As the war enters its 
 third year, both sides struggle to find enough men to

 of Russia, around 144 million people, three times that of Ukraine, 
 It gives a significant advantage in labor.

 more possible another round of mobilizations. Instead, incentives have promoted

 Important, the author of the recently published memories, “By All Means

 that. And we have had - we have had a session on that as good. Let me 
 Start: if we could open the battlefield map. This is at the beginning 
 of this month. We get out of the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense, Defense 
 Intelligence. And what I wanted to do is remind everyone where we have come 
 of. So you can't see it on the map itself, but you visualize it after 
 Russian initial attacks on at least five axes did control the 
 territory, some of which we can see here. They also tried to push 
 down from Belarus and parts of Russia to take kyiv, in what 
 They failed. Járkov City, which, as you can see, is not under Russian control, 
 in which they failed. Then we saw multiple phases in which the Ukrainians 
 They could effectively resume part of this territory, here in Kharkiv, with 
 an offensive operation.

    I think the other way in which the analogy of 
 World War I is misleading - and again, it is because people do not

 There are many casualties. I don't want to minimize that - and it's absurd and there is no, you know, 
 No particular innovation.

    Well, that's a good transition for Emily. As 
 Would you value the American spare, including debates in Congress? And of

 United has provided so far. Then we can go to the maps. Around 
 of 2 million bullets of 155 millimeters, 2,000- in addition to Stingers, Javelins and

    Yes, if this graph is supposed to relieve my 
 frustration, it is only a work species. (Laughs.) I would call him hesitation. 
 The United States response has been hesitant. I think, without charity, I know 
 I could say that we have been to play while Rome burns. We have been 
 debating among us, exactly what a small weapons system

    There is a cube of that. And then partially self -centered. 
 And the autodisuasion piece is this constant to convince ourselves of 
 that if we provide the next system or additional capacity, then that will be what 
 that tilts Russia to expand the conflict. It simply has not happened. 
 Russia as interested as we are restricted to Ukraine. AND 
 the more that we allow them to continue advancing without retreating, the most will

 A great job here. In the CSIS, I know that some of our colleagues in

 To what extent and how Europeans and high -level war are useful, for

 Naval capacities, including anti -submarine war. That takes you out of the problem

   Yes. So it's 
 When I take away my indignant politician and put my hat of 
 Impartial analyst, or at least I do my best to do it. If you see 
 The linear analysis of where this conflict is directed, we must think that Russia 
 He will try to take advantage of his advantage in men and possibly power of 
 fire, although we have an intense debate about who will have the advantage in 
 firepower. But they continue to throw metal and people in the problem.

   You have to think that Ukraine will be trapped in this 
 defensive position for at least next year, while trying to discover 
 Some fundamental things and a reassessment of the strategy. So, 
 Looking, you know, what are you doing? To gather the labor you need to face 
 To the Russians? What do you do with mandatory military service or not? What do you do to 
 Try to obtain this hodgepodge of different materials they have and 
 combine it in an effective and coherent combat force. But that's really 
 Inherent to, we are sitting almost still while we try to solve this and 
 Wait for any type of Russian offense like the one we saw in Avdiivka.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;">
<span face='"Arial","sans-serif"'>
   So what would that evaluation change? Those who 
 The evaluations of the Ukrainian side would change, I think they are much more 
 Probable that the big ones, changes on the Russian side. So I'll review them 
 first.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;">
<span face='"Arial","sans-serif"'>
   The first option is that the United States approves the 
 Help package; Europeans do not use that as an opportunity to say 
 "UF" and go back to what they have been. In doing so, they also advance 
 with a huge amount of help; that Ukraine continues to carry the fight to 
 Russians We were talking about surprises before. One of my surprises is the little 
 that the Russian population has really felt the impact of this conflict. If that 
 Change, if we find a way to make the Russian population understand the 
 Costs of this conflict. to them in their places of origin. And then, if Ukraine 
 Find a way of choosing subaters differently. I mean, me 
 give in to military analysts in the room, who would know exactly 
 how it would be seen, but they find ways to focus on a particular area and 
 achieve progress there, could see that changing that scenario I proposed to 
 2024.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;">
<span face='"Arial","sans-serif"'>
   On the Russian side, these are much more likely issues 
 And high impact, could there be roller troops riots? We saw what 
 Unpleasant with the Wagner group. You know, could something like this happen again 
 On a smaller scale along the Russian front lines? Is there one 
 possibility? That at some point in 2025 there will be a fall in the 
 Russian production of ammunition? I think that would change the rules of the game to 
 the conflict if it were really true and if China had not come to 
 save them. And then the real black swan is that something arises from the murder 
 from Navalny, that really becomes some kind of internal disturbance 
 Within Russia that attracts Putin's attention to return to internal problems 
 Russians more than continue the war in Ukraine. You know, the fighter for the 
 Freedom in me really expects that to happen, but I don't see many 
 indications that this can be the way. We go

    Well I think 
 You are probably thinking of some very mundane things. Things like: how 
 Can I simply sustain strength? How can I rotate tired troops? 
 You know, how ... how do I train not only the new troops but also to the 
 new troops as individuals? - Do you know, the Ukrainians have not been so 
 intense as we would be in individual troops training, but in 
 reality what is probably even the most important thing at this time is 
 vitally important. But upper level training of units of 
 Battalions/brigades, training of older states, I think there is much of that. 
 They are thinking clearly: they have created this new command for aerial systems 
 Not beed, get such things to stand up. And I think they 
 - You know, they want to deliberately - the reason why they have clung to 
 Avdiivka because it has some political meaning for them. But I think, as in 
 Bakhmut, who decided that the Russians really bleed, because 
 I think they understand (not everyone in the West do it: that resources 
 Russia are not infinite and that if the Army Dustusia is suffering losses 
 Very large, even among young officers and others. ignition: they will have 
 problems to perform any type of maneuver important operation only 
 because they will not have the officers who can carry out…. Then I think 
 There is that. I think absorbing the new technology that
   </span>

    get. Those are going to be their concerns to 
 2024, in addition to processing
   </span>
<span>
    Other campaigns we have talked about.

    I mean, you know, that naval campaign has been 
 Extremely successful and I think they will want to continue with it. The attack campaign 
 deep, too. And then I suspect that 
 They will be thinking a lot about what will happen in 2025, and he will be thinking a lot 
 in this. About it. So I suspect that this is a year in which they will be in 
 great extent in the positional struggle, trying to prepare for what could

 Europe. You know, we can talk about democracy, and this is the whitest war and

 For the defense of Europe, and Europe is still very important for states

   . And you know, 
 there would be more threats to Europe if Russia won, and could also carry some 
 time. And we would also have, you know, maybe a weakening of the 
 European resolution, followed by a weakening of the US resolution. 
 You know, as Eliot said, we tend to lead these things. And it is very important 
 Let us do it. And then I think it is also a global problem. It is not just a

   Yes, I would love to try to draw a straight line from what 
 That is happening in Ukraine until, you know, someone's wallet in 
 Kansas

    . It is a little long trip, but be patient. If you think about the 
 way in which the United States operates on the world stage, we have deliveries 
 Just in time on Walmart shelves. We have supply chains that 
 They cover everyone. And all these things are possible because the United States and 
 His allies have attached to a world system that tries to respect the State

 They happen

   . What Putin has done with his invasion of Ukraine that is to say: I don't 
 None of that imports. I want the world system to be reaped in the way that 
 I like it. I want to show that the UN makes no sense, that the United States 
 It is weak, that American democracy is not as good as it seems. AND 
 I want the United States to fight internally, alone, against yourself, instead 
 to use its vast global power to guarantee a safer world and 
 prosperous. The Chinese saw that and said: we like that idea. What we want 
 It is a world that is safe for Chinese companies. We want to manage 
 The world as we believe should be managed. We don't care about freedoms 
 personal We do not care democracy. What matters to us is to make money 
 For us and for our business. So we also agree with 
 That as a plan. Let's see how we can alter this global system in our favor.

<p>
  The Heroic National Resistance of Palestine has revealed a feature of the new moment of revolutions we entered. In it we see regional confrontations that snap and simultaneously scale, in an unprecedented rhythm, and involving interests the most multifaceted and at the same time interlated.
 </p>
<p>
  While the resistance corner of the Sionist State's genocidal forces in the gaza, the Yankees are forced to reactivate their operations in North Africa to try to neutralize the intrepid Yeamenite people who do not accept passive attempt by Holocaust Palestinian. This would be enough to end Yankee imperialism in severe strategic crossroads: but, adding the scheduling of the conflict in Ukraine, in which Russian imperialism recovers some positions, which forces the imperialists to climb the threats of a war between them without, without Precedents.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the Yanks have their biggest long -term concern in Asia. There, China launched its long -range strategy of the “New Silk Route” and reached new foundations for the dispute with the Yankee, penetrating its capital on vast zones of influence and semicolonies of Yankee imperialism; The Chinese social-imperialist regime has also elevated military spending and established that the main contradiction to be solved is the “ability to defend”, that is, here too, the greatest militarization of its society and economy for the war of conquest. On the other hand, imperialists Ianques responded with training of military vessels in the southern sea, strengthening the Taiwan and Hong Kong territories, hostile to the social-imperialist regime; At the same time, it established in its strategic policy that the biggest threat to US security in perspective is China Social-Imperialist.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, the world imperialist system has already prepared to raise wars and conflicts around the world: in the last two years, a dizzying growth of world military spending has been recorded. The equivalent of R $ 10.9 trillion with weapons and military equipment were moved. Greater than Brazil's GDP, the amount is less than the spending in the second world war and is driven by these two more magnitude conflicts in recent times.
 </p>
<p>
  For this scenario, the European Union will allocate 240 million euros to military spending. A European Union diplomat said it is necessary to “prepare for much more demanding times”, indicating that the war will continue to be the main trend for the coming years. Russia, atomic superpower, has announced that it will allocate two fifths of its economy to the war industry: 376 billion euros. Although all imperialist superpowers and powers are increasingly spending on military ground, they are the Americans who take the lead, with $ 4.5 trillion (41% of the total spent worldwide).
 </p>
<p>
  Such an imperialist arms race, because they overcome their rivals on means of war to impose their interests on each other, but on very fragile ground.
 </p>
<p>
  When the Chinese real estate monopoly EVERGRENE announced its bankruptcy on August 18, 2023, the danger alert was lit in all imperialist powers. China, which is the second country that spends the most military level, has been presenting since 2018 a trend to fall in economic growth rate. That year, China had a growth rate of 6.6%, the lowest in 40 years so far. For 2030, a growth of 3% per year is expected - in Chinese terms, which has been growing on average 10% per year for forty years, this is a catastrophe. With the growth of the “real estate and financial bubble”, it is no longer possible to prevent the crisis of Chinese capitalism, which will necessarily come, reaching all major economies without exception.
 </p>
<p>
  In both statements and actions, imperialists admit the danger of what they call “multicrisses”, euphemism for the general crisis of decomposition of the world system. The magazine
  <em>
   The Economist
  </em>
  He released a recent survey in which he admits, even in an institution advocating the old order, that more than 92% of the world's population is not in regimes with full democratic freedoms. If the ideologues of the old order, which exist precisely to beautify it, are required to admit in these terms the seriousness of their crisis, it is a significant sign of the times. Times, by the way, when 43% of the US population estimates that a civil war is likely in the next 10 years.
 </p>
<p>
  There is no doubt that we find ourselves right now in those historical moments when, by analogy, the slow crumbling of an old decaying structure is observed. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles, in essential to Palestine, brought to light the degrading situation of imperialism. The masses should be supported in these examples, redouble the desire to fight and defy dethrone the emperor, after all, the Palestinian cause shows with singular clarity: he is already falling.

  On the morning of March 2, the Ceará Front of Support for Palestinian Resistance promoted an important agitation “in memory of the more than 112 murdered in the Flour Massacre, by the end of Zionism and the Assassin State of Israel and in defense of the Palestinian people and of the Palestinian National Resistance ”with microphone, Palestinian flags and pamphleting.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to the hundreds of distributed pamphlets, part of the masses spontaneously demonstrated support for agitation, with sayings such as “Live Free Palestine!”. He captured special attention to the denunciation of the coverage of communication monopolies, which, like the great minions of imperialism, approached the flour massacre as a "confusion."

  A Palestinian man who went through agitation gave his active support to protesters. In a private conversation, he revealed that his sister still lives in the West Bank and is under constant threat of the hordes of Zionist settlers.
 </p>
<p>
  In the speech, the Ceará Front of Support for Palestinian Resistance stated that it is the duty of all Brazilian democrats and internationalists to defend the Palestinian people and their national resistance. They also stated that pro-Palestinian mobilization should be intensified in the country, with agitation, leafleting, public debates and demonstrations.

  About 100,000 people were affected by a historic flood in Acre in late February. The National Secretariat of Protection and Civil Defense (SEDEC) put 17 of the 22 Acre cities in emergency on February 25. For years plans for flood prevention have been allegedly assembled in the region, but never leave the paper. On February 27, 340 people were homeless and 127 homeless.
 </p>
<p>
  The flood began in Assis Brasil with the flood of the Acre River basin. In a short time there were the floods of the streams in Rio Branco, followed by the flood of the Acre River, which impacted Rio Branco, Assis Brasil, Brasileia, Epitaciolândia, Porto Acre, Placido de Castro, Capixaba, Xapuri, South Cruise, Seine Madureira, Feijó , Tarauacá, Santa Rosa, Jordan, Marshal Thaumaturgo, Porto Walter and Mâncio Lima.
 </p>
<p>
  On February 28, Rio Acre reached the 15.56 meter mark in the municipality of Brasiléia, surpassing the historic flood of 2015. At that time, the river reached 15.55m. About 75% of the city is affected. The locomotion is only possible through river as the earth's way is isolated. Already in the capital, Rio Branco, the river hit 16.82 meters.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Plans do not leave the paper
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In 2020, the city hall conducted a survey with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM), exposing that in 52 years of monitoring, the capital of Acre had recorded 41 floods of the Acre River.
 </p>
<p>
  The survey conducted four years ago aimed to build a plan to face climate and environmental change, but never left the paper.
 </p>
<p>
  After the research, Acre underwent large floods in the year 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. In all, these episodes, the poor were the most affected, especially villages of riverside peasants. Rural and indigenous areas are also affected.
 </p>
<p>
  Even so, the state follows without solid planning for flood prevention.

  On March 2, more than 100 residents of São Sebastião de Caí, Metropolitan Zone of Porto Alegre, blocked the KM 4 of the RS-122 highway against the installation of a toll that charges abusive prices for the residents of the city. This is the third protest in the region against the installation of the roads on the roads, which have the bidding of the company Caminhos da Serra Gaucha (CSG).
 </p>
<p>
  The concentration of protesters began in the morning at 9am. A huge police apparatus was mobilized to try to intimidate protesters. In contrast, drivers who were going through the journey honored frequently in support of the mobilization.
 </p>
<p>
  The toll, which will start operating this month, has the value of R $ 12.30 in both directions, and without exemption to the majority of the city's population, except for residents of only 3 neighborhoods of the municipality closer to the toll. For the Valley of Happiness region, where most people have to move to work to large cities such as Montenegro and Novo Hamburgo, the climate is of indignation and deep distrust in the municipalities and state government.

   Writing Note:

  The article below was written by students of psychology from the Federal University of Paraná and sent to us by the corresponding site of

  The new wave of the precariousness of Brazilian education is now captained by the new high school, whose pedagogical policy annihilates the humanitarian and scientific aspects of education and reduces it to the most nefarious utilitarianism: it aims at the conformation of young people to structural unemployment, preparing them for being “entrepreneurs” pot cake and narrowing their political horizons to “what goes on”.
 </p>
<p>
  The implementation of such a harmful project cannot come, as is usual, without an ideological cover -up, which takes place in many ways in the current government management, Luís Inácio, after all, used the “defense of science” as one of its main Electoral motors. Thus, the attempt to implement the new high school is accompanied by several fallacies - such as the supposed importance of integral education without any investment that enables schools to apply properly to the full regime - and welfare proposals that serve more to mask the precariousness than compensate it-this is the case of the shameful “foot” of high school. We can also think of the current policy of psychology in schools as, so far, an mainly aesthetic measure.
 </p>
<p>
  Federal Law 13,935, 2019, approved the Social Assistance and Psychology Service in all public basic education schools and gave a year for the implementation of the program, leaving responsibility to education systems. According to the Paulista Medical Association website (APM), however, the implementation of the program only began in early 2022. In Paraná, this law remained only on paper until, it seems, the end of 2023, when a Notice was opened for hiring social and psychology professionals.
 </p>
<p>
  A synthesis made by APM from the 2022 school census points out that only 13% of schools in Brazil have hired psychology professionals. Private schools, however, have up to ten professionals, while the public, when they have, is just one.
 </p>
<p>
  Firstly, it should be noted that psychological service in schools is of paramount importance and cannot be essentially outpatient, that is, it should not have as its main function remedy situations of panic and anxiety crises. The psychologist is a professional who must be integrated with pedagogical dynamics and participate in the construction and execution of local and regional educational policies. It is essential, at this moment, that the professional class mobilizes to effect its right to be in schools and not let this law become a piece of paper among many others. This involves taking part in the struggles against the precariousness of education, being today the main one the fight against the new high school, and for a true scientific and democratic reform of education. It is worthless the existence of rights without the means to realize them. The approval of Law 13.935/2019 means nothing but demagogy about education and mental health and will continue this way without the mobilization of the class.
 </p>
<p>
  This understanding of the psychologist as an actor in a broader system is also important not to fall into a widely widespread conception in the press monopolies: that the psychologist is solely responsible for the “psychic welfare” of the school community. It is common, when we read reports on the performance of the psychology professional in schools, that psychological practice is reduced to the aforementioned outpatient care or, even worse, is cited as an absolute prevention for "massacres" in schools.
 </p>
<p>
  It should be understood that the school is not only a place where young people decorate textbooks, as the new high school intends, but it is, for much of the youth, the essential pole of socialization and construction of meanings of life. Cases of massacres in schools cannot be understood as the work of anomalous individuals, with some syndrome, whom merely lacked individual psychological counseling. On the contrary, it is a symptom of bankruptcy of the humanizing potential of the educational system.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, it is essential for psychologists who work or intend to work in the educational system that organize themselves-in addition to the struggles of their professional class to effect hiring-along with students and other education professionals in the fight against a precarious, anti-cinientific and utilitarian project of education. The new high school mutilates the school's humanizing potential and makes it an increasingly conducive space for psychological suffering, marginalization and violence. A policy worthy of mental health in education depends on a pedagogical policy that transforms the school into a democratic, scientific and progressive polo, not an unemployed entrepreneur factory.

  The official history of my city says that when the large land owners, the previous inhabitants, the Puri, were all or almost all decimated. It was not a mere carnage. They had already been shifted from somewhere in the Holy Spirit and decided to no longer accept the expulsion. They resisted to death, brave. I know that some at least lived, for anywhere in my family tree, says my mother, there was a Puro - and my mother is not given to lie. I also know because I once met a Puro descendant lady who had punched a police officer's head on the doorway while he was trying to invade his house and wouldn't dare to question her. But what does this have to do with floods? I get there, but it's not good to hurry the thought, so have patience.
 </p>
<p>
  See. The landlords arrived. Before that the place was what they would call the savage. This in nineteenth -century Brazil, in Minas Gerais, could and often meant a gold trafficking route. For these lands that I know as the palm of my hand, not much different or more special than other palms of other hands and that in fact, I confess, I never stopped to analyze as long as necessary, passed the Crown Tax Evasors and the Settlement was prohibited. Almost mid-1800, only colonization took place. In 1882, the city was fully emancipated and, in 1891, the district was conformed, which in fact had an area that today comprised 12 different municipalities. In 1887, a ballast railway from the Alto-Muriahé Railroad, two years later bought by the English monopoly
  <em>
   The Leopoldina Railway Company Limited
  </em>
  , it was built to establish communication with the ports of the country's then capital, Rio de Janeiro, when economic development seemed very close and the yes who once made the route could finally rest.
 </p>
<p>
  What attracted the railroad was the coffee, introduced in 1848 and whose production at its peak reached 100,000 bags per year. A blow to the São Paulo coffee economy, due to a destructive frost, increased the importance of production in the region in the late nineteenth century. We were, however, more than eventual substitutes for São Paulo production, the pioneers of the 1929 crisis. The collusion known as the Taubaté agreement, which involved the Latifundes of the Southeast and the governments of Francisco Antônio de Sales, in Minas, Jorge Tibiriçá, in São Paulo, and Nilo Peçanha, in Rio de Janeiro, ratified by President Afonso Pena, has rushed to us in over two decades the decay of this culture artificially maintained by the old state. After the crisis induced by the rejection of our coffee bags in 1907, which did not agree with the standards of the agreement, the cattle raising was expanded on the one hand, and some adventurers sought to bring us the industry, on the other . I can't help but consider building the soil a little heroic where I was born from the first Porcelain insulators factory in South America in 1917. A considerable industry was also installed at the same time for the manufacture of lathes and lime. In 1926, however, companies entered insolvency. With the 1929 crisis affecting coffee production, we folded the bet on the “agricultural destination” to stabilize the economy.
 </p>
<p>
  In the midst of all this story, districts were dismembering. One in 1922, two in 1938, two in 1953 etc., until it reached the last in 1993. The statement of the “agricultural destination” was, paradoxically, paired with the reduction of agricultural abilities. Much of the lands most suitable for planting coffee went to the municipalities dismembered. From thirteen large warehouses in the 1930s, we went to three in the 1950s. Adhering to the policy of eradication of “unproductive” coffee plantations, the same that promised massive industrialization and impacted 71% of the coffee tree of neighboring Espírito Santo (35% of all The impacted territory in the country), we gained roads in the 1960s, without, however, having much more to transport them. In 1976, the old railroad was eradicated, not without first taking away a substantial amount of people, many practically runaway. In order not to be unfair with history, we had another industry in the city, the second oldest dairy industry in the country, born there in 1915 as a soap factory. He employed a lot of people, transferred the office to Valadares in 1984 and today its ruins are a museum, literally, and a bathroom for stretch party, in the figurative sense, near the place where the train arrived.
 </p>
<p>
  After 140 years since the foundation, the old nickname “Princess of the Zona da Mata” seems strange. Perhaps our fairy tale was told in reverse.
 </p>
<p>
  The fact is that of the 353,404 km² that are considered municipal territory, incredible 5.45 km² are urban, while almost 30% of homes do not have adequate sewage and less than 40% are on public roads with proper urbanization. At the same time, less than 19% of the population is occupied, more than 30% earns up to half a minimum wage and almost 70% of our revenues come from external sources. Another fact is that the population decreases instead of increasing.
 </p>
<p>
  The installments of the population that do not find employment in the service sector, the only minimally functional in the urbanized environment, in part will seek it in the fields, in the coffee with naked hands, hoping to get the income that will support them the whole year. Not long ago, the solution to others was to board and work on the oil tankers, but a walk on the streets of Macaé and a look at his beach is enough to realize that this time is gone and along with her the possibility of seeing the family of 15 in 15 days after winning the month. There is so many, therefore, the decision to leave alone or with their family to get in another corner.
 </p>
<p>
  To those who tolerated the exhibition without question whether it is a chronicle, a history booklet, or a research from IBGE-and those who tolerated it despite the questioning-congrater, first, then reaching the point. And the point is the relationship between the universal and the particular.
 </p>
<p>
  It's no ridm, I promise.
 </p>
<p>
  If the last great function of the old railroad was to take away the people, this was also the first function of the road. From 1907, in the first crisis, to 1978, from 1978 to 2024, the difference is the largest or lowest flows. In the 1960s, like our capixabas neighbors, that scratching of coffee plantations and other endless plantations. They all came out in search of the large cities, the capitals, where the “development” would come from politics. Much of the earth was redirected to livestock, modifying in appearance, as a friend and countryman recently pointed out, the
  <em>
   betting
  </em>
  of the Minas Gerais epic.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, poor peasants were not consulted in the decision and, unlike the rich, were not compensated for the arrival of "development" - but many of them had their work and even their life sacrificed to this strange God. The reason was so perfectly bureaucratic that Kafka would laugh: technical assistance was a condition for access to financing; Access to rural credit, in turn, also depended on access to technical assistance; Thus, the peasant could not acquire rural credit to diversify the plantation or modernization because it had no assistance, just as it could not obtain the financing granted by eradication for not having assistance. Who would give the technical assistance? To this day it has not been answered the unknown and a long time we would pass by the gates of the law trying to decipher it. Only 19% of rural properties have access to it and the “technification” of the field remains on the horizon, not so beautiful or convincing, covered with endless pastures and five oxen in sight.
 </p>
<p>
  This tale of my city, this melancholy and absurd tale, is just one of the many that explain the facts that conflined to the emptying of the Minas Gerais field, Capixaba and throughout the country. Like many others of the same order, he conflicted and conflicted with so many different orders everywhere, flowing into the current situation, where the population of the countryside tends to see while the population of homeless people, widely concentrated in large urban centers, It increases vertiginly - 211% between 2012 and 2022, against an increase of 11% of the general population. The so many small towns that swarm so pronounced in a vast state as mines, as well as the palm of the author's hand in relation to other palms of different hands, have gone through a similar evolutionary process, semi-identical in some cases, of dismemberments of the ruin of the economy, especially the peasant, and considering them urban is almost a derision. They are, when very, small and precarious “warehouses” for the purchase of imported inputs. In addition, only the testimony of now more than five centuries of landlords, with all the carnage of indigenous and peasants, all the paramilitary apparatus used today against them, embossed under the disgusting and fragile façade of the “unscathed” “agribusiness” POP - Testimony of a fantasy called “Agrarian Reform”.
 </p>
<p>
  "But what about the floods?" Yes, I come to them. In addition, on top of all the historic dismissal, there were still the floods. I must have seen at least seven or eight of them, a few in a row, two so high that they reached the second floor of the houses on my street - and followed in 2020 and 2021. In the midst of the chaotic situation of the day after downtown waters , mixture of mud and mice dead with rubble and broken glass broken furniture and mirror ready to tear the foot of someone, what I remember most is the solidarity among people, who, knowing that the kite trucks would pass two, three , twenty times in the center before they reached the other neighborhoods, they cleaned the street together, either in the midst of a chat about any offal or laughing, they thanked the skies for their homes to stand and helped each other to go down the furniture. Hurntly placed on the terrace, often from the neighbor's house.
 </p>
<p>
  But the floods, damn ones, and along with them the landslides, which recently killed eight people in Baixada and southern Fluminense.
 </p>
<p>
  After taking the same way as many of those who once were looking for a job to the old worker neighborhood where my school was or on the street (in the village time) where the houses were built on huge stone blocks and glued each other at the other on request the owner of the dairy, in which I lived, after making this path, which was the way of escape, the path of
  <em>
   Leopoldina Railway
  </em>
  , Despite having done so for very diverse reasons, I finally understood the depth of the deemed denead.
 </p>
<p>
  Too obviously, they are on the streets of our old capital, every corner, in each square, the evidence of a crime against the people, crowded and hungry. It is possible to follow the criminal's footsteps to the closed factories of St. Christopher. The slums are semi -feuded reinventions of Engels Manchester. But the floods, I say, for some reason show me the common roughness of things.
 </p>
<p>
  And not exactly the floods, in fact, because the waters, like the rails, are apolitical by themselves. The question is who they reach and punish and why they continue to punish.
 </p>
<p>
  When I go to the bar nearby, my sensitive waiter still cries about the devastation of the property of peasants in Rio Grande do Sul last year. The driver tells me about the eight dead and the neglect of the municipalities with these cities that only serve to feed the capital with cheap labor, it included. The doorman tells me that in Caxias it can be ugly if it rains again. And when I take the elevator, I come to the words of Lima Barreto in 1915: “Rio de Janeiro, Avenida,
  <em>
   squares
  </em>
  of the electrical brakes, it cannot be at the mercy of rain. ”
 </p>
<p>
  This is how I reach the Puris, Minas Gerais, to Espírito Santo,
  <em>
   Leopoldina Railway
  </em>
  , to the five oxen in the pasture of the lands of the victims of eradication and that are stretched and stretched by my vast state as a pustula and repeat and repeat from the south to the north of the country, to the beggars in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Water pumps paid with PAC money and never installed to prevent floods in Caxias, the dead and ruined of Rio Grande do Sul and in the Fluminenses lands.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, it's all the same Gordian knot, which at least simplifies the act of cutting it.

   "24 -year -old American soldier set fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington ..."
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  "My name is Aaron Busnell. I am an active member of the US Air Force and I will no longer be a genocide complicit. I am going to subsidize an extreme protest act, but compared to what they are experiencing
  <a href="https://www.lifo.gr/tags/polemos-israil-hamas" target="_blank">
   People in Palestine
  </a>
  , it's not extreme at all ... ". In these words, on February 25, 2024, 24 -year -old American soldier Aaron Busnell set fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington shouting "freedom in Palestine". The day after, succumbing to his wounds, he left his last breath in the hospital. It is striking that while he was wrapped in flames, a police officer of the Israeli Embassy guard, he was marking him with a gun, while his colleague screaming "I don't need weapons, I need fire extinguishers!"
 </p>
<p>
  24 -year -old Aaron, the "human man", has served in the US Armed Forces for almost four years. He had graduated from basic education "first in class" and according to the first testimonies of friends and acquaintances was "social, gentle, cheerful and positive", which denies any attempts to attribute his act to a mental disorder.
 </p>
<p>
  Also, almost three months ago, on December 1, 2023, a woman wrapped in the Palestinian flag set fire outside the Israeli consulate in Atlanta, USA and was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
 </p>
<p>
  How much, such incidents have happened around the world, without being able to penetrate the law of the silence of international media?
 </p>
<p>
  Acts of despair or heroic acts of protest? In any case, the crime that takes place in Gaza since October 7, the genocide of the Palestinian people who have so far led to over 30,000 dead, with over half of being young children, the slow and excruciating death of hundreds daily by daily Food, water and medicine shortages, the constant bombings that have turned the country into a skull, cannot be silenced. Not even the popular anger. Millions of protesters daily in all lengths and widths of the planet, even in the great metropolises of capitalism, fill the streets for the slaughter.
 </p>
<p>
  All of these acts of protest, from young Aaron's self -identification to the millions of protesters create, but also show, the serious tricks that the genocide in Gaza provokes inside the imperialist states of the West. Terrrps that were also shown in their "reluctance" (except for other reasons) to join the US Naval Enterprise in the US in the Red Sea. A company that, despite the initial statements of the US Minister of National Defense on 20 participating countries, met the objections of France, Spain, Denmark, Australia and Italy.
 </p>
<p>

   Now stop the genocide of the Palestinian people!

<p>
  Officers revealed in late February pointed out that the number of indigenous people killed in IT Yanomami grew in the first year of Lula government compared to Bolsonaro's last. In 2022, 343 indigenous people died from the crisis triggered by the great mining supported by the old state. In 2023, with the maintenance of the crisis, the number rose to 363. The numbers are consistent with the overall ineffectiveness that even affected the most basic initiatives to circumvent the crisis.
 </p>
<p>
  The government claimed that there was a "underwear" in 2022, so the number increased by 2023. A clear attempt to escape responsibilities. In 2023, 30,000 malaria chaos were recorded in Yanomami territory, an increase of 4,696 cases compared to the January newsletter. Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAG) also reported an increase of 1,506 cases, with final balance of 7,104 occurrences. Finally, the year 2023 ended with 26,747 influenza cases, 6.2 thousand more than in the previous report of the Ministry of Health.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Military and government did not take action
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The year 2023 was marked by the government's innovation in the fight against the crisis. Early on, Lula appointed the reactionary armed forces for basic functions, such as the delivery of basic baskets. Until June, half of them had not been delivered. Even so, the government has not changed responsibility and did not exchange the officers responsible for the operation. In the opposite direction, it expanded the military presence in the region by establishing two military bases in IT Yanomami.
 </p>
<p>
  This year, 50 boxes of medicine for the Yanomami Special Sanitary District (DSEI-Y) were found in an abandoned house in the municipality of Boa Vista, in Roraima, during an “operation” against narcotics. Among the medicines were Yanomami essential items, such as antibiotics, deworms, analgesics, anesthetics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Infectious diseases and worm contamination were some of the reasons for Yanomami deaths, especially children.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   The true reasons for the crisis
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The truth is that the government did not take any measure that, in fact, to resolve the deepest issues that cause the crisis in IT Yanomami. Currently, the central problems caused in IT are generated by the presence of the great mining.
 </p>
<p>
  The great mining features the participation of latifaces, great bourgeois, politicians and even military personnel of the high official of the reactionary armed forces.
  <strong>
</strong>
  Last year, the High Command of the Air Force also refused to advertise illegal aircraft data in the Amazon region during an investigation against the mining. In the middle of the same year, Lieutenant Colonel Alves Pinto was investigated for leaking police operations data to large prospectors in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  These sectors of the ruling classes entice landless peasants to the work of mining, subject to the worst working conditions and, often, servants of production.
 </p>
<p>
  The solution to the issue would therefore necessarily pass the delivery of land to the peasants, to avoid, first of all, the possibility of enticing peasants in a situation of misery for work in the TIs.
 </p>
<p>
  On the contrary, the government in 2023 did not even buy a meter of land for land reform. The number of zero lands purchased was identical to Bolsonaro in 2022.

<p>
  General Freire Gomes, then army commander at the time of the 2022 coup agitation, spoke for more than seven hours to investigators. Estadão writer Marcelo Godoy, who had access to the testimony, said that the general attributed to Bolsonaro and personal problems some of his attitudes, or lack of.
 </p>
<p>
  The general said, for example, that
  <strong>
   prevented
  </strong>
  the disassembly of scammer camps in front of the army facilities. He even admitted that he even gave the Planalto Military Commander, who on December 29 had demanded the removal of camps in Brasilia: Gomes interposed, scolded his subordinate and ordered the "green chickens" to be there, because he feared Hit the then president. On January 8, ten days later, the extremist direction of extremists left to break into government, STF and Congress facilities and came back. Whoever commanded that thing should thank General Freire Gomes for the strategic logistics provided.
 </p>
<p>
  It was this same general who signed - along with the other two Armed Forces commanders - the official note of November 11, 2022, which he treated the requests for military intervention of "democratic manifestations." And it said more: that it was necessary not to “censor” of these protesters, choir with pockets.
 </p>
<p>
  Gomes also confirmed that there were meetings, in which he was present, with Bolsonaro and in which he became aware of the Defense Defense Defense and State State Decree project. Not only: Freire Gomes himself received reports, directly from Bolsonaro's former administrator, X-9 Mauro Cid. “Today, he moved a lot in that decree, right. He reduced a lot. He did something more direct, objective and short and limited, ”the whistleblower told the general in a message as to suggest that such a modification showed that Bolsonaro had been convinced. But by whom, and what?
 </p>
<p>
  But it wasn't just that. It was during the command of Freire Gomes that the army participated in the Electoral Transparency Commission (April-until onwards), making biased questions to support a suspicion, which was later used by Bolsonaro for his disruption.
 </p>
<p>
  For all suspicions, Freire Gomes has the same, generic and comprehensive answer: everything she did - and what she didn't - was by hierarchy, under Bolsonaro's orders or with the aim of not being insubordinated to avoid aggravating the crisis. The result was just the opposite: the crisis worsened until the imminence of institutional rupture, which proves to be only half truth to the general's word. Finally, he said that though he knew everything, he said nothing, because he could not prove, he would be discredited and replaced by someone prone to the coup. Yes, because "no one would ever believe" that Bolsonaro was preparing a break, and it would be "very difficult" to prove something against him (as he is now proving, with unbelievable ease!).
 </p>
<p>
  Judging by your excuses, we are facing
  <em>
   Freire Gomes, the saint
  </em>
  . But reality unmasks him. We are facing
  <em>
   FREIRE GOMES, THE BOARD
  </em>
  ! Maybe that's why Braga Neto nicknamed him with that rude epithet. It is the general who will be remembered as the one who waited until the last bid for the definition of the facts, to choose which side to follow.

    Feminist blitz in the metro of Rome, pink writings on walls and vagons: "Sister you are not alone". It would be at least 50 girls and young women who, at one week after March 8, broke into the metro of Rome. "Sister you are not alone", reads the wall after their passage. But also "less police, more transfeminism", "the witches are back". The blitz comes exactly one week from the date of March 8, the International Women's Day. The signature, as stated under some of the writings on the Metro walls, is of the Aracne assembly, a Roman student transfeminist assembly.

  The 2
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of February marks the anniversary of the victory of the Red Army in the battle of Stalingrad (02/02/1943). Hitler’s fascist hordes tried to conquer the USSR in three months with their Blitz Krieg, something they had already done in several European countries. They wanted to destroy and conquer the Socialist Homeland. But the highest and most illustrious German leaders did not count on the imposing, courageous and heroic people under the firm leadership of Comrade Stalin. These are heroic pages of the international proletariat that can never be forgotten, they are indelible demonstrations of courage and heroism in the face of the Nazi beast.
 </p>
<p>
  Already in 1941, the glorious Red Army, under the direction and command of Comrade Stalin, had already opposed with fearless resistance the fierce Nazi-German attack, at the gates of the city of Moscow. They targeted Stalingrad because it was the industrial center of the USSR, which at that time had the strategic role of producing artillery goods for the resistance troops. The city was located around the Volga River, which was an important route connecting the western part of the country with its distant eastern regions. Furthermore, Hitler counted on the propaganda effect that meant taking the city named after the great Stalin. With the command of “No step back” from the great leader of the international proletariat and the Bolshevik Party, Stalingrad decisively did not retreat or evacuate its 400 thousand inhabitants and the masses joined the War of Liberation of the socialist Fatherland. In the winter of 1942-43 alone, the Germans lost more than 7 thousand tanks, 4 thousand planes, 17 thousand guns. Since the start of the German invasion, the Red Army had put nine million Nazi-fascist officers and men out of action, of whose no less than 4 million died on the battlefield.
 </p>
<p>
  This is how Chairman Mao Tse-Tung explains the meaning of this battle:
 </p>
<p>
  “During those forty-eight days, the news of each setback or triumph from that city gripped the hearts of countless millions of people, now bringing them anxiety, now stirring them to elation. This battle is not only the turning point of the Soviet-German war, or even of the present antifascist world war, it is the turning point in the history of all mankind. Throughout these forty-eight days, the people of the world watched Stalingrad with even greater concern than they watched Moscow last October. […] following the battle for the defense of Stalingrad, the situation will be totally different from that of last year. On the one hand, the Soviet Union will launch a second winter counteroffensive on a vast scale, Britain and the United States will no longer be able to delay the opening of the second front (though the exact date cannot yet be foretold), and the people of Europe will be ready to rise up in response. On the other hand, Germany and her European accomplices no longer have the strength to mount large-scale offensives, and Hitler will have no alternative but to change his whole line of policy to the strategic defensive.”
 </p>
<p>
  Stalingrad offered its share of blood, more than 20 thousand lives in a war street by street, house by house, attic by attic, floor by floor, room by room, chapters of heroism that shook the world, beginning the counteroffensive to defeat Nazi-fascism during the Second World War!
 </p>
<p>
  In these heroic pages, women bravely stood out. They unleashed their revolutionary fury by taking up their positions in the struggle for their emancipation as part of the emancipation of the class. They could not surrender, renounce all the achievements that the construction of socialism had already given them, it was necessary to defeat the Nazis and advance further.

   Hereby we publish an unofficial translation of some excerpts published in the article, which come from the memories of Marshal Vasili. I Chuikov, commander of the 62
   <sup>
    nd
   </sup>
   Army of Stalingrad:
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (…) Although in the past many women served in the armed forces and on the front lines on their own initiative, Soviet women went to the front called upon by the Party and the Komsomol [Communist Youth of the Soviet Union], deeply aware of their defense duties and of the interests of their socialist country. They had been prepared for this by our Communist Party, because at the time our State was the only one in the world in which women enjoyed, according to the Constitution, the same rights as men. (…)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   There is no exaggeration in saying that women fought alongside men everywhere during the war.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   It must also be remembered that in the second half of 1942, when our armies had withdrawn to a line running through Leningrad, Mozhaysk, Voronezh, Stalingrad and Mozdok, leaving densely populated areas in enemy hands, and then new recruits were needed. Women, massively joined the Army and this made it possible for us to restore our units and bases until their full efficiency. (…)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   The communications’ units of the 62
   <sup>
    nd
   </sup>
   Army were mainly made up of women, which carried out their instructions with dedication. If we sent them to a communications position, we could be sure that communications would be secure. Artillery and mortars could shot against the position, planes could drop bombs on it, enemy troops could surround it – but, unless we ordered to do it, women did not abandon their position even in the face of death.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   I know the case of a girl who stayed at a communications position near Basargino station – a young woman whose name was Nadia Klimenko. Her comrades had been killed or injured, but she remained at her position and continued to report what was happening on the battlefield. This was her last report to the Army communications center: “There is no one left at the position. I’m alone. Shells explode all around…To the right I can see tanks, with crosses painted on them, moving, with infantry behind…It’s too late for me to leave. I don’t care if they shoot! I will continue to inform you in the same way. Listen! A tank approaches to my position. Two men jump out of it…They are looking around – I think they are officers. They’re coming towards me. My heart stopped beating for fear of what might happen…” This was the end. Nobody knows what happened to Nadia Klimenko. (…)

<p>
  Demands were raised for the release of recently imprisoned political prisoners, including Partizan reader Arzu Aksakal, with the slogan “Let the dungeons be destroyed, freedom for the prisoners”. The crimes of the government in regards to the 2023 earthquake were denounced frequently. Photographs of women murdered or disappeared in the earthquake as well as women murdered as a result of patriarchal violence were carried. The struggle of women in the workplace and universities were also raised, as well as solidarity with those suffering from war and occupation around the world, and support of the struggle of the Saturday Mothers who have been demanding to learn the fate of those who have disappeared in custody of the old Turkish State.

  We also share an unofficial translation of a statement by the YDK:
 </br></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
  The burden of the world on our shoulders, the weaving workers in our memory, the struggle for freedom in our consciousness…
 </h2>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  On the 8th of March 1857, 40,000 women weavers went on strike in New York, USA, demanding “equal pay for equal work”. In the fire that broke out during this strike, 129 women workers who were locked in the factory lost their lives.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  The 1850s were years when labor movements were on the rise in the USA. Industrial workers were working under extraordinarily difficult conditions. Women led the working class of the period and went on strike to demand a reduction of the 16-hour workday to 10 hours, correction of inhumane working conditions, an increase in wages, and equal rights for women workers.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  After this event, at the meeting of the women of the 2nd International (International Socialist Women’s Conference) in Copenhagen, Denmark, Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg, leaders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, proposed that the 8th of March should be International Women’s Day and the proposal was accepted.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Since then, women have been fighting for the demands put forward by the murdered weavers.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Women continued to be inspired by this history of resistance and took to the streets every 8th of March, despite all the pressure, difficult conditions and bans. All over the world, women have struggled and continue to struggle for their invisible, ignored and underpaid labor. As in other countries, women in Turkey, Kurdistan and the Middle East are taking to the streets and shouting their demands on the streets.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Today, women are being condemned to more poverty, which has been exposed by the deepening economic crisis on a global scale, and are being slaughtered by the wars going on around the world. The roads of migration become the roads of death for women. If they are not on the road, they are subjected to attacks such as harassment and rape in addition to poverty where they stay, and they are killed in their homes, workplaces and streets as a result of male violence.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Today, the fascist AKP-MHP bloc, the representative of the patriarchal State, constantly attacks women’s vested rights. These attacks have become even more reckless after the annulment of the Istanbul Convention, which was signed with the rising wave of women’s struggle and rebellion. Women who struggle for their rights and gains are also subjected to all kinds of violence by the patriarchal State.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  In this geography, as in Palestine and Rojava, poor peoples, mostly women and LGBTI+s, are massacred in the wars waged by the imperialist-capitalist system in search of markets.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  On the other hand, the blatant massacre of workers and nature in Erzincan İliç by the patriarchal State and its representatives AKP-MHP will cause serious problems in the region in the coming years. This massacre will place a new and heavy workload on the shoulders of women. Already today, women are worried about their future in the region, wondering what they can do for a healthier future for their children.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  We saw a similar situation when the 6th of February Maraş earthquake turned into a massacre of hundreds of thousands of people. Women were forced to shoulder very heavy burdens for the survival of those left behind and are still trying to survive in the earthquake zone by shouldering burdens that are getting exponentially heavier.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  In the wars caused by the sovereigns, the burden of the poor peoples, the burden of the massacre of nature and all living things through ecological massacres, the burden of the massacre of people, nature and living things in the region through the earthquake, and the burden of the poverty caused by the economic crisis are also placed on the shoulders of women. Just as their labor at home is ignored, the worth of the labor they create in workplaces and factories is decreasing day by day.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Despite all the countless burdens, women stubbornly and persistently do not give up their struggle all over the world. We women, with the burden of the world on our shoulders, with the weaving workers in our memory, persistently continue the struggle for freedom that we inherited and engraved in our consciousness despite all wars, massacres and attacks. We are in every moment of life and struggle, as in the resistance of Palestinian women, as in the resistance of Rojavan women against the war waged by the imperialist-capitalists and their lackey the Turkish State using all kinds of technology, as in the resistance of women who have been shouldering the invisible but increasing burden since the 6th of February, as in the resistance of women at Agrobay, Özak, Sputnik, Burda Bebek and in countless factories who claim their labor, which is ignored and seen as cheap labor, as in the resistance of women. We are also present in the struggle for survival against the violence, harassment and rape they are subjected to at home with the argument of the patriarchal State’s “sacred family”, and in the effort to organize in universities despite all oppression and attacks. We are also the ones who put a stop to the patriarchal State that hatefully tries to make our lives dependent on cotton threads with elevator massacres. We are the women and LGBTI+”s who do not withdraw from workplaces, workplaces, streets and action areas despite all attacks and ignoring. We will be on the streets this 8th of March as we are every 8th of March. We continue our march for freedom this 8th of March as well. We call on all women to take action on the streets to enlarge this march.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  Long live 8th of March, long live women’s solidarity!
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">

  For the repressive forces of the Pakistani state in a decade, losing more than 500 agents and soldiers. The number of insurgences and armed groups operating in the country is very high, with conflicts present at the border with Afghanistan, on the border with Iran, in Baluchistan, etc. Recently have occurred

  This growth in armed activity is being especially intense in the Baluchistan region, where the people fight against the state of Pakistan and against the interests of monopolies. In this region, multiple contradictions are exacerbated, a nation oppressed by imperialism, and Baluchistan where their people fight for their right to work and live in their lands against the large companies plunder of natural resources.
  <a href="https://narratives.com.pk/featured/balochistan-minerals-from-dust-to-glory/">
   Mineral resources are enormous and there is a great interest of imperialisms for them:
  </a>
  There is a variety of great value for gold, silver, copper, iron, lithium, etc., etc., in more than 1,600 mines. For example, the Reko DIQ mine represents one of the largest gold and copper reserves in the world, and is owned by the great Yankee monopoly Barrick. Also the Chinese Metallurgical Group Corp (MCC) monopoly is present in the area.

   who are pressing the Pakistani government

  to increase security in the area, and therefore repression. Several Baluchistan resistance organizations such as the Baluchistan Liberation Front or the Baluchistan Liberation Army have been tildied with terrorists in accordance with the laws of various imperialist powers. During this start of the year there have been numerous armed actions of draft by the armed Baluchí groups.

  There were three coordinated attacks, including a strong attack on a prison, which eliminated 15 Pakistani agents. A few days ago there was another outstanding action, an attack against a police police station that

  This intense armed activity has marked the elections that were held yesterday. The elections from the outset have been a process that has clearly been directed and executed as a complete farce by the dominant Pakistani and imperialism classes. From the first moment, Imran Khan has been kept out of play with constants and sudden
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/30/1227870386/pakistan-imran-khan-sentenced-10-years">

  . Some media also wanted to see Khan as a progressive or less reactionary alternative than that represented by Nawaz Sharif, but the reality is that he was faithfully committed to

   Protect the interests of Chinese socialimperialism
  </a>
  and suppress the Baluchí people. In addition, Nawaz Sharif's return to the country as a candidate supported by the military, has left the stage for the farce that has taken place on February 8. But the masses broadly distrust the electoral promises of the various candidates who have appeared to the elections and

<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/505973/corruption-spotlight-pakistan-economy-spirals.aspx">
   ón will improve after this new electoral farce.
  </a>
  The truth is that even many of the bourgeois media point to a lack of total transparency, and that everything has been prepared for Sharif to win the elections with the help of the military.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9c04832a4482ef221ae89662ba7a64cf">
  To this is added the
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/2/7/pakistans-election-can-the-incoming-government-bring-economic-stability">
   deep crisis
  </a>
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/2/7/pakistans-election-can-the-incoming-government-bring-economic-stability">
</a>
  of bureaucratic capitalism in Pakistan. Economic indicators are entirely dramatic: 40% of the population lives below the poverty threshold; Inflation has grown up to more than 30%. The people clearly see the situation: according to surveys conducted last week, about 70% believe that economic conditions are worsening. On the other hand, the control of Yankee imperialism over the country is also clear if the recent agreement is observed
  <a href="https://time.com/6293769/imf-loan-pakistan/">
   of the International Monetary Fund with Pakistan
  </a>
  , to which he has provided 3,000 million dollars, after having agreed in July an immediate disbursement of 1.2 billion dollars. This economic crisis is part of the crisis of bureaucratic capitalism, which is also expressed in the serious political crisis in the country. Pakistani dominant classes and imperialism, mainly Yankee, seek to stabilize the country with the latest elections and formation of a new government for the State, although in front of them they have the clear distrust of the people. Now another added problem is that most elected candidates are "independent", which means, from Khan's party. But they will not be allowed to form government, since this is only allowed for the parties. The biggest party will be Nawaz Sharif's party, which will form government, but it will be without a majority in Parliament, totally unstable, which will even more sharpening the political crisis in Pakistan.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ee7bf425d16b4eca5876b41fac433c3b">
  The general situation as we see is an intense general crisis of bureaucratic capitalism in the region of southern Asia, which specifically in Pakistan, is very intense and has no signs of resolving. The only solution is to completely sweep the origin of the problem, which is imperialism itself and the oppression and exploitation of oppressed peoples in the area.

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b6bf46129846746626be6905a759438b">
  Buekele, is a component of a generation that comes from the leaf litter of an internal conflict recreated by the revisionism of the FMLN [Farabundo Martí for National Liberation]; Sand paramilitarism [Nationalist Republican Alliance] and US mercenaries in the 80s of the last century.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-218b70ff41cdd746bb3e83ab80984a15">
  As expected, with the capitulation of the FMLN many guerrillas and paramilitary, without political north and carriers of a transnochad for making control of the old landowner bureaucratic state.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-fe656cd3253ab883316e422cd6dcee72">
  That is, the genesis of violence, internal bands, hitmen, etc., responds to structural problems, but, also, goes hand in hand with a whole failed political process that generated an uncontrolled and at the same time functional violence, such as what happened in the equator.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ae3590a79848848e3e52e5b3ef134fb8">
  Obviously, the masses were disenchanted from the FMLN leadership that "took out her nails," bureaucratized and became a more component of that bureaucratic bourgeoisie that was desired to be close to the state apparatus to reproduce politically and economically. Not different was with sand and the extreme right, a kind of thugs of the buyer bourgeoisie intimately linked to the repressive and intelligence devices of imperialism. In that scenario, any month The roughly beaten by the buying bourgeoisie, created the conditions for a young man, with fascist, assuming the presidency, developed a political and economic program very close to fascism, which outside a classic format, adapts to a semicolonial society and Semi -feudal, conflictive, with deep contradictions, where any cattle raising the story of "peace", "freedom" outside the weaknesses or bankruptcy structure, was going to have support.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c5e206af2e325f5db0d87b17763b91ce">
  Bukele has been shown to the world as the new ruler model. Young, radical, informal, decisive, boss in "a safe country to live."
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ef4ee239bb7f856546117d110b071bb0">
  The Muletilla of Security, above all, of the classes, of the contradictions, of the relations of production, of the misery, of unemployment and bureaucratic inefficiency (except to throw shots or repress the masses), it has given a luck of "Light dictatorship" that oppresses the people, violated bourgeois freedoms and institutions and delivered a strong and consolidated power to the repressive devices of the State.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1256a3e28bcc88e519f1b0b536e8a06e">
  However, El Salvador, in economic terms, is a disaster. It has an annual growth that barely reaches 1%, of the lowest in America; It has the highest poverty rate in America. It has an external and internal debt that comes nothing less than 85% of GDP. It owes the bicoca of 10,000 million dollars to the workers' pensions. 50% of Salvadorans have no job or work in informality.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5e214a506fb279660d195241b6315853">
  The life expectancy of men in El Salvador is one of the lowest in the continent, 66, women: 75 years. It is the country with the slowest growth in the region. It has the highest imprisonment rate in the world, incredibly 1.6% of the population is detained in prisons. The educational system at all levels is critical, lacking adequate infrastructure, but has the most modern prisons in the region, not only that, "exports" its penitentiary model to other countries, such as ours.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-82a1632952b7de3d01a32ccc40fbb0c2">
  El Salvador, like Ecuador, its states are parasites of remittances. The contribution made by the millions of Salvadorans who emigrated to the US is in the order of 26% in relation to GDP. A brutality, without a doubt.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bd3e62cf43dad12bec2eea880210ca31">
  That is, there is crisis of bureaucratic capitalism and its old state, but they have an important sector of the imprisoned population; That, in addition to having been observed by the permanent violation of Human Rights, it has given way to a new generation of children who do not live with their parents, either because they are as prisoners or have emigrated to the US. Can you expect this not to generate a new army of violent in the short term?
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c6309e5b51729257ced97e5de230d9d8">
  In Ecuador they sell us the idea that the "Bukele" model is the one we must follow; Moreover, they compare Daniel Noboa with Bukele; They paint him as his successor, or worse, his "double." In fact, Noboa tries to copy his style, irreverent, and the first thing he did was go out to pursue and imprison low -mount criminals, but also tattooed boys, young people who spend in the poor neighborhoods in the corners; where being poor is already a stigma to be attacked, arrested and processed as a terrorist. Not only that, he wanted to go from "living" by declaring war material as scrap and delivering to the US putting the country in an international crisis for the answers that Russia issued.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2b218f43a64c12211acbee079b90c378">
  We must understand, all these models of governments point to three specific objectives: strengthen the Yankee imperialist presence in our countries, today weakened with the lack of response of their allies in Ukraine and, to some extent, in Gaza, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Iran. Recover or energize bureaucratic capitalism in Third World countries, mainly from America, its "backyard", to conjure the revolution and, more corporatize the masses and the peoples, putting, ahead, ahead, presidents and servile Lacayas authorities to the US and that they can be "firm", "determinants", regardless of whether they explore or incur fascist behaviors, in the final, the propaganda machinery of imperialism, knows, in great form, handle and manipulate the consciousness of the masses.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-df0eeb1063ee1732992e73f1e8ac5ec3">
  Bukele and Noboa are parasites from the US; They are ascent fascists and must be fought as appropriate!
