The peasants know very well the Military Police of the area and therefore they strongly reject them. AND explains the reason \u201cThe Military Police in Jaqueira, and more specifically the 10th Battalion of the Military Police, is denounced because it is used by the big landlord company Agropecu\u00e1ria Mata Sul S/A to gather information on the struggling peasants, by intimidating women and children in order to escalate the conflict in Barro Branco\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the lawyer was dealing with those police officers, the peasants prepared for the attack: they organize themselves quickly, used fireworks to rise awareness among all the peasants in the encampment, erected a barricade and a crowd of peasants arrived to the place. This crowd started to chant: \u201cPolice out of here!\u201d. The Military Police retreat from the area.\n </p>\n</div>", "pdf_content": "", "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/11/19/peasants-of-barro-branco-expel-military-police/", "type": "article", "title": "Peasants of Barro Branco expel Military Police \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "A Nova Democracia reported yesterday on a new criminal action lead by latifundium against the peasants in Barro Branco, Pernambuco.
