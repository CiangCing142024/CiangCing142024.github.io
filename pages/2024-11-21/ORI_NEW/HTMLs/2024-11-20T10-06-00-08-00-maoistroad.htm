 <h2>
  How Trump's election came and what it brings to the planet
 </h2>
 <p>
  The US election has concluded, recording an at least comfortable 
victory for Trump. A victory that flatly contradicted the chorus of 
"predictions" and "estimates" of the most "authoritative" agencies and 
"analysts" who, until the last minute, even through exit-polls in US 
states, presented a picture of an "electoral derby" or even a Harris 
lead! This construction is also a measure of the "democracy provided" by
 electoral processes for capitalist parliaments in general, let alone in
 the USA, with the given electoral-political system and the undisguised 
domination of the electoral process by billionaires!
 </p>
 <p>
  As post-electoral distortions about the terms of this electoral 
victory and phony concerns about the real goals of the US abound, here 
are some initial points on this issue.
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Trump's electoral victory was undoubtedly based on the support of 
billionaires and we would say that Musk is only the tip of the iceberg. 
Key power centers have been firmly behind him and at his side throughout
 the civil-war-like election period, seeking to shape —through him and 
with him— responses to the big and urgent issues facing US imperialism. 
And it is precisely because these answers are being sought and shaped 
that the turmoil and overall reconfiguration of the US political system 
will continue. It is not only the "Democrats" who are looking for a 
navigating line and a leader after their "exhaustion" with Biden and the
 last-minute change with —the "unknown" until July— Harris. Also for the
 Republicans, the "line-identity" of Trump and —of similar and upgraded 
standards of his vice-president— Vance, creates new elements, "new 
party", as it was recorded during the election with a number of their 
traditional and front-line staff (Cheney etc.) coming out against Trump.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   The line with which Trump won the election was based on the American
 nationalism of "MAGA", the most powerful nationalism, the one that 
corresponds to the objectives of the first imperialist power on the 
planet. On the basis of this nationalism he developed all aspects of his
 ultra-reactive demagogy and managed to electorally rally the majority 
of the working and popular strata living in conditions of brutal 
exploitation, poverty, misery and social barbarism. Precisely because 
"America above all" was presented as the only condition that can save 
the "American dream" within the US, to answer the acute problems of the 
masses, in an economy pressured by the crisis, particularly after 
Biden's unsuccessful programs. At the same time, however, and to make 
this condition a reality, all the reactive measures, all the atrocities 
included in the "Trump program" become a prerequisite. From the savage 
tax breaks for big business to the crackdown on immigrants and women. A 
class raid, part of the overall class attack on the proletariat and 
people's rights.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   The victory of this electoral line took place in
 the context of the presidential elections and in particular in the 
specific unprecedented reactive and acrimonious conditions that 
prevailed during the election period in the USA, which gave the feeling 
of a country deeply divided and with civil-war-like dimensions. 
Obviously, this victory, particularly in order for it to exist, made the
 most of the very negative class-political correlation under which the 
working popular masses are situated, the disintegration of the working 
class and the absence of significant militant revolutionary forces and 
voices with a noteworthy reach. After all, the forces that present 
themselves as "anti-Trump" forces, in the US and internationally, and 
across the board (from the "Democrats" in the US to... PASOK in our 
country) are —at the very least— consistent servants of the line of 
capital and imperialism’s aggression against the working class and the 
peoples. And of course these forces are openly and actively hostile to 
any struggle, to any resistance of the masses against this line. 
However, we believe that this electoral victory cannot and will not stop
 the course of the mass and workers’ struggles, the militant processes 
that have been going on for years (not only) within the USA.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   Trump's electoral victory does not constitute a certain and swift 
response to the question of the relative retreat of the US, to the 
question of the pacing of US imperialism towards the goal of global 
hegemony/sovereignty, which is the basic common goal of all the 
conflicting centers and dominant powers within the US. The Trump 
presidency, with what it has so far proclaimed, comes seeking:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   a)
 Managing the Ukrainian impasse, which is currently the central, 
strategic issue for the US. A management aimed, on the one hand, at 
controlling the further escalation of the war, as this escalation brings
 the nuclear threats of Russian imperialism very close to being carried 
out. On the other hand, however, this management must be such that it 
does not recognize a victory for Moscow and does not open the way for 
the disintegration of NATO.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   b) A more decisive approach to China,
 the lifting of barriers on the new "Silk Road", the reversal of 
Beijing's "zones" of establishment in a number of countries and regions 
on which Chinese imperialism largely bases its strategic upgrade.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   A
 key and crucial precondition for the promotion of both these directions
 is the political direction of the Trump presidency to confront the 
European imperialists "one by one", but also as an alliance, as an EU. 
That is, the intensification of US blackmails separately on Germany, 
France but also Italy, and on the basis of the specific issues facing 
each of them. The obvious goal of such a direction is for the US to 
distract one or some of them, to haunt them without objection to their 
strategic choices. The recent Draghi report highlighted this danger and 
sought (or, more correctly perhaps, wished) to address it. However, the 
situation in Germany, with the governing coalition in collapse, also 
emerged on the basis of the major issues already shaped by German 
imperialism, but also in view of the expected American blackmail and 
with the question of Berlin's responses. The rise of Trump finds the two
 EU locomotives in political and economic crisis, with a simultaneous 
inability to express a unified stance both towards the war in Ukraine 
and towards developments in the Middle East.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With what specific 
measures and options these directions are to be expressed, what they 
will produce, what modifications and what adventurism they will need, 
remains to be seen and to be judged in real terms on the table of 
imperialist antagonisms, full of sharp contrasts. Moreover, there are a 
number of other hot spots, such as the Middle East, where the Trump 
administration will be called upon to gauge in conjunction with its 
aforementioned aspirations, whether and how to continue along the line 
of escalating Iranian tightening —which it had followed in its previous 
term— but then without the strategic given and impasse of the war in 
Ukraine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </li>
  <li>
   The workers and peoples of the world have many very good reasons to 
be concerned about what the Trump presidency brings to the planet. None 
of these reasons not only are they not identical, but not even related 
to the concerns of the imperialists of Europe and a number of dominant 
and reactionary forces on the planet.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Trump administration's 
line is, even before it takes office, a milestone of upgrading of the 
anti-worker, anti-people rampage underway on a global scale. A station 
that seeks to be of comparable weight to the Reagan-Thatcher line that 
signaled the generalized aggression in the early 1980s. This is the 
common ground of all the imperialists and capital, of all the political 
forces that serve them, everywhere in the world. It is their common 
ground for dealing with the capitalist crisis that is spreading and 
deepening, feeding off each other in the imperialist conflicts. It is 
their common ground that is rooted in the negative correlation, in their
 quest to transform the workers into "tools" of capital, and the peoples
 into subjects to imperialism.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the same time, the Trump line 
to serve US imperialism's goal of global hegemony/sovereignty, whichever
 paths it takes, will continue and intensify the preparation of the 
conditions for World War III.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strengthening of the mass 
resistances and struggles, the building of the working people's forces 
on the basis of their own rights and their own perspective, the 
strengthening-construction of the revolutionary communist direction in 
the movement and struggle, is the only real answer to the developments 
we face.
