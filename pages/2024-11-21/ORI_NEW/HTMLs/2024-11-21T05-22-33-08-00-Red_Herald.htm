  We hereby share a statement we have received from Campaign Against State Repression (CASR)
 </p>
 <p>
  On 30th October 2024, the Home Ministry of Chhattisgarh has issued a circular which states that Moolwasi Bachao Manch is an unlawful, anti-development organisation and has been banned under the draconian Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act (CSPSA), without citing any concrete reasons for the same.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Moolwasi Bachao Manch is a democratic mass organisation of adivasi peasants in Bastar fighting against corporate loot and militarision, in particular, they have been fighting against the establishment of camps and been at the forefront of the anti-camp movement. These military camps only benefit the state and not the adivasis-peasants as they clear the way for capitalists to plunder the country’s resources. For this reason, the state has been continuously harrassing and suppressing the organisation which raises the democratic voices of the people. The organisation has been exercising its fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and fighting against the state’s activities which harm the lifestyle, livelihood and culture of the adivasis. Over the  past 6 months, numerous activists of the organisation have been kidnapped  under the pretence of detention. Further, many activists associated with the organisation, including Sarju Tekam and Suneeta Pottam, have been arrested under the false charge of being members of CPI Maoist. Numerous activists have also been tortured in the state’s illegal custody.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is part of the State’s attempt to completely dissolve Moolwasi Bachao Manch, and to clamp down on the democratic right to dissent of the Adivasis. The banning of the organisation is part of the state’s intensified campaign against Moolwasi Bachao Manch. By banning the organisation, the state will find it easier to clamp down on the activists working for the rights and voice of the exploited and oppressed groups like adivasis with even further impunity. By banning the organisation, the state is able to exercise extra-ordinary powers of the draconian security law.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The state has also been tagging all of these activists as Maoists, in an attempt to criminalize voices that speak truth to power. The State’s intimidatory tactics and attempt to clamp down on dissent are against the constitutional rights that each citizen has in this country. The state is attacking those activists who utilize the rights that exist to ensure the protection of Adivasis. These are the individuals who talk about the encounter killing of Adivasis and the state violence on Adivasis and by attacking the voices by talking about the repression, they plan on ensuring the silence of the Adivasis.
  <br/>
  CASR urge all democratic minded people and organisation to come together and condemn this  fascist attack on Adivasi Rights organisation.
