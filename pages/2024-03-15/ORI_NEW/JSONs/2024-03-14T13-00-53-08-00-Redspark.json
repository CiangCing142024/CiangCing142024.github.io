It was also attended by allied organizations, such as Solidarity International, ARARAT Armenian Collective, MLPD, German Filipino Friendship, Kurdish Women, Resbak, Philippine Buro and Interburo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to BAYAN-Europe, Marcos Jr\u2019s visit to Germany and other European countries from March 11-15 should serve as an occasion for all Filipino migrants and human rights defenders to condemn the brutal regime that commit gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL).\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIt is wrong to welcome this Marcos junket, the main purpose of which is to deodorize the stinking image of Marcos and his family in the international community,\u201d according to the BAYAN-Europe statement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Historically, the allied organizations in Germany have been among the most committed supporters of the movement against the Marcos fascist dictatorship in the 70s and 80s.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marcos Jr\u2019s visit is expected to seal negotiations for Germany to supply drones to the Philippines supposedly for maritime security against China. This Military aid will be awarded amid the gross violations of international humanitarian law and heavy militarization and indiscriminate bombing of the countryside perpetrated by the Marcos regime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The protesters also called on the European Union to stop supporting the Marcos Jr regime by ending military aid. Germany and the EU are both signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which supplies military aid, weapons and other military equipment to the Philippines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It can be recalled that during the Duterte regime, the EU strongly condemned the war on drugs and human rights violations. In February 2022, the EU Parliament issued a resolution that threatened to withdraw the Philippines\u2019 GSP+ and other incentives, such as the benefit of zero tariff (no layer tax) on goods from the EU, if the Duterte regime did not stop the violations. Germany is the largest trading partner of the Philippines in Europe.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Source : https://philippinerevolution.nu/angbayan/filipinos-protest-marcos-visit-to-germany/\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.redspark.nu/en/imperialist-states/from-ang-bayan-filipinos-protest-marcos-visit-to-germany/", "type": "article", "title": "From Ang Bayan: Filipinos Protest Marcos\u2019 Visit To Germany - Redspark", "description": "Ang Bayan March 14, 2024 Ferdinand Marcos Jr\u2019s visit to Berlin on March 13 was met with protests by Filipino", "modified time": "2024-03-14T21:13:42+00:00", "author": ["Alan Warsaw"], "categories": ["Germany", "Imperialist States", "People's War", "Philippines"], "tags": ["ALPAS Pilipinas", "Ang Bayan", "Antifascism", "ARARAT Armenian Collective", "Arms Trade Treaty", "ATT", "BAYAN-Europe", "Berlin", "China", "communist party of the philippines", "CPP", "CPP-NPA-NDF", "CPP-NPA-NDFP", "Dictatorship of Marcos", "Duterte", "EU", "Europe", "European Union", "Fascism", "Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr", "Ferdinand Marcos Jr.", "GABRIELA-Germany", "German Filipino Friendship", "Germany", "Interburo", "Kurdish Women", "Marcos", "Marcos II Regime", "Marcos-Duterte Regime", "Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany", "MLPD", "National Democratic Front of the Philippines", "NDFP", "new people's army", "NPA", "People's War", "Philippine Buro", "Philippine Revolution", "Philippine Revolution Web Central", "philippines", "PPW", "PPW in the Philippines", "Resbak", "Rodrigo Duterte", "Sara Duterte", "Solidarity International", "US-Duterte regime", "US-Marcos Dictatorship", "US-Marcos-Duterte Regime"], "source_name": "Redspark"}
