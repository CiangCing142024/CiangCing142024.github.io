   The KKE is calling on Thursday 14/3 today, at 7pm in the Propylaea, the gathering and march of the provocative prosecutor's prosecution for the 12-year-old Sepolia case, which acquits the victims and condemns the victims!
  </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
   BELOW THE POLICY OF A SYSTEM THAT MAKES-SUPPORT-DIAGNOSIS!
  </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<strong>
   Let's be all there ...
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Anger and indignation at the prosecutor's vulgar proposal in the 12 -year -old case from Sepolia.
  </strong>
  The rape turned into meetings for a 12 -year -old child who were systematically rushed by dozens of adults "above all suspicion". In fact, the 12 -year -old is considered guilty as it is considered to be half of the meeting. The rapist and mastic Micho is considered innocent of the accusations of rape and mastrian. Just "facilitated" the 12 -year -old. All the categories fall into the mother with no doubt.
 </p>
<p>
  The prosecutor's attitude is "consistent". He served the political system and its expressors to the end. Micho knows and hides many and powerful. ND local commander, with close ties with the church, while at the same time coordinating the trade of people and prostitution in the Sepolia region. How much dirt? How much canoe? What can justice first of all?
 </p>
<p>
  From the first moment the case was unveiled and the crimes were revealed, the system did everything he could to cover the victims and kill the victims. The mother was in prison, her 12 -year -old and her brothers were threatened with their lives. Without any psychological, medical or financial support, she even deprived her of the right to come into contact with her mother.
  <strong>
   State, police, judges, did what they could to convince all 12 years that they should not speak and report their rapists.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The people are angry in the face of injustice and the concealment of the rotten. Similar fate had other cases of concealment of rich and high -ranking rapists and assassins. From the agriculture case in Thessaloniki to the mass crime of Tempi, the so -called "justice" presents the same consequence, serves the laws and those for whom they are written. The few and the powerful guaranteed rights and freedoms and whenever needed, mitigating and doubts are discovered. For the many, the poor, the oppressed, the law is relentless, a bite on his head.
 </p>
<p>
  The same "consistent" is the police, which conceals rape, inside and outside the police stations. It does not discriminate to rapists and not, it covers them all. And he is always at the forefront, ready to suppress any demonstration, concentration, strike. With the same consistency he chased and hit the demonstrators yesterday in Sepolia. The people who came out on the road to express their anger, fight for a fair decision and denouncing the concealment was confronted with MATs and Chemicals. This supports the attack on the people and their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The people are angry, not only today, not only because they do not tolerate a criminal and a basis like mich, but also for all the other suffering that has loaded him. Private universities, crime in Tempi, accuracy, disasters, war, auctions, terrorism, criminal code, fascism, afternoon surgeries, carinating, poverty….
 </p>
<p>
  This system has condemned us long before the crimes are committed. We will not let it acquit the culprits.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Guilty to the capitalist system itself, governments, judges, repression bodies.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   We must also look consistent with the 12 -year -old, towards ourselves. To condemn Micho and all the culprits! To hope for a life with rights!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   All on the streets! The river is not turning back!
  </strong>

  The International Communist Union (EKB): To the communist and revolutionary prisoners on the 18 March International Political Prison Day ”!
 </h2>
<p>
  March 18 is the Solidarity Day with International Political Prison. Founded by the Comintern in 1920, the Red Assistance Organization dedicated 18 March to the political prisoners, the foundation day of the Paris Commune in 1923, and declared it as “Solidarity Day with International Political Prison”. Solidarity is raised with political prisoners on March 18th around the world.
 </p>
<p>
  Against the order of exploitation and persecution we have lived in thousands of years, great resistance has been carried out at every stage of history and large costs have been paid.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
    This is, above all, an ideological war embodied in two enemies and irreconcilable classes. Since it keeps the contradiction between the oppressor and oppressed of the objective conditions of the imperialist system, the massacre and imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries does not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, deepening contradictions are directly reflected in class oppositions and the gap of the revolutionary and communists who are massacred, imprisoned and imprisoned are filled with new ones.
   </p>
<p>
    As the contradictions of the sovereign system deepens and their dilemmas increase, as their fears of the “grave scraper grew up, the ruling classes do not hesitate to emerge with their true character more concrete. The deepened and alleviated crisis of the system also makes the bourgeoisie and the exploitative ruling class of all kinds of exploitative state mechanism more and more centralized by its laws and actual organizations, making its pressure mechanisms more prominent. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which define themselves as “ideal” and “advanced democracy ,, the successive security laws, the new laws that increase the powers of the state's law enforcement powers show us that the bourgeoisie's“ democracy mask ”is behind. With all the reaction, the bourgeoisie re -fortune the position of the working class and oppressed laborers and oppressed peoples.
   </p>
<p p="">
<p>
     The reactionary Indian state has imprisoned more than ten thousand communists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha to prevent the popular war.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has not been released even though he has finished the sentence given by French imperialism for nearly 40 years. Mumia Abu-Jamal Black Panthers Member has been in prison by US imperialism for more than 40 years. In the different geographies of the world, thousands of communist, revolutionary and oppressed nations lived in prisons of the prisoner of the prisoners in prisoners.
    </p>
<p>
     The fear of the ruling classes from the communist and revolutionary prisoners, and the hostility of the class that they feel the eyebrows, they are so great that they even act with great distinction so that the communist and revolutionaries they have captured by violating their own laws openly. PKP leader President Gonzalo, who lost his health under 29 years of isolation conditions last year and caused the necessary measures to be taken, is very important in terms of seeing the dimension of the fear and class of hatred of the imperialists and Uşak sovereign system owners. Those who caused the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed their funeral.
    </p>
<p>
     The communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons are trying to fulfill the requirements of class struggle at the expense of their lives by pushing all boundaries under the conditions of captivity. They do not hesitate to reject the surrender and resist all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation attack. We must mobilize to embrace the justifiable struggle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against all kinds of aggression on the prisoners, to become the voice of the prisoners outside, and to embrace their struggle as part of the class struggle outside.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      The communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      To embrace the communist and revolutionary prisoners is to claim the struggle for revolution!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Let us claim the resistance and struggle of the communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let's be the voice of the prisoners!

   In their fight against the authorities as well as against individual bourgeois, the workers showed themselves everywhere intellectually and morally superior, and in their conflicts with the so -called "employers of work", they showed that now they, the workers, were the cultured men and that the capitalists, however, were rough men. Furthermore, they led the struggle mostly with a sense of humor that is the best proof of how much they were sure of their cause and aware of their superiority.

 doubt that the capitalism of the free-cambio, of the period 
 manufacturing, has brought a significant number of darkened women

<strong>
   After 10 years in captivity, G.N. Saibaba, human rights activist and former university professor, finally comment to the public. The comrade is acquitted and released, despite the fact that the ancient Indian state had sentenced him to a lifetime imprisonment for alleged connections to the Maoists.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  A press conference is held, where Saibaba touches and urgently tells why he became an activist, about the problems in India and about the process against him. Many media showed up, and the press conference was published by several of these. All over the world, revolutionary and democratic movements have struggled to defend Saibaba's life, and all of these can now celebrate the release.

 A deafening silence and an unthinkable absence is characterized by this year's 26th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival. Unfortunately, this is not a mere negligence of the lack of readiness of its organizers. It is a glaring option for exclusion for anything that reminds the greatest genocide of the 21st century that is currently being held in Palestine by the Zionist, fascist state of Israel, with the US-NATO-EU contacted.
 <br>
<p>
</p>
<p p="">
<p>
   This is not a random choice. It is directly related to the policy of the current Greek government (but also of the previous ones) to develop close relations with the occupation of Israel and to completely change even this policy of older Greek governments of the Transition against the Palestinian struggle. It is related to its involvement in the war in Ukraine and its mission to the Reds on the side of Westerners and Israel. That is why at a time when the most reactionary and criminal wing of the Zionists in our country are ruled by those who support the Palestinian struggle. It is a clear political choice for the organizers of the festival, and in the city that has experienced and knows how to stigmatize the anthropomic from whatever status they are committed and whatever they do.
  </p>
<p>
   In the face of this challenge, one progressive man of the city, none of the spectators of the festival can remain indifferent. Must disapprove of this unacceptable option. He must protest and even ask for the 26th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival to include in a special screening, even a documentary on the modern Palestine tragedy.

  From the first moment, the case of rape and coercion in the prostitution of the 12 -year -old by Sepolia is not convenient. What else is the dirt and stench is the vulgarity with which, from the beginning, the media have tried to highlight Elias Michou's patriotic and Christian profile while he himself was "when God was not looking" was a brutal rapist and a fan of minor girls! What other than '' strong backs '' and management '' soft '' are his photos with politicians and other prominent rotten devotees!
  <br>
<br>
  Who can forget that Domna Michailidou's "address" of the child '' escaped 'her so that they can threaten and intimidate it in the disclosure of evidence? Who are they afraid of?
  <br>
<br>
  The attempt to blame the 12 -year -old victim and her family from the outset is messing with a concealment! The 12 -year -old's testimonies, the rapists he recognizes and increasingly are growing, the elements that emerge show a large circuit. A large circuit, including high -ranking faces. A circuit that civil justice will do everything to protect!
  <br/>
<br/>
  The heinous prosecution proposes the acquittal of St. Elias Michou for rape due to doubts, for mastics in detention centers and for coercion and porn revenue. For the '' monster mother '', of course, it is proposed to guilty for lashing in the form of unbearable pressures, emotional blackmail and prompts to her minor daughter to be published.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Once again, the revelation of the "law" of civil justice is vomiting! The '' right '' of violence, exploitation, oppression, defense of the social middle ages, legalization of each side of our lives once again triumphs!
  <br/>
<br/>
  But there is still a dangerous side in the prosecution's proposal!
  <br/>
<br/>
  The prosecutor was the prosecutor.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The popular feminist view that has been circulating in recent years and presents the presence and conquest of rights in the presence of women in positions of responsibility such as PDP, prosecutors and judges, directors and administrators, in essence hides, legitimizes, co -exist Regardless of sex, they are called upon to serve those who take these positions.
  <br/>
<br/>
  It is a view that does not recognize the real enemy and traps the female movement in the impasse that proposes the system of oppression and exploitation as a one -way street. Distorts the words "right" and "conquest". It is the view that closes its eyes on the double oppression of the woman and does not recognize that the way for emancipation and release is the path of the relentless struggle to overthrow this system.
  <br/>
<br/>
  As such, a female prosecutor conquered the right to acquit the "unjust" and "in love" Micho who did not rapist, did not issue but "it made it easier for a child to be issued".

<p>
   Although I know about the importance of denouncing the oppression and violence that women and girls face in this society, I consider that - given the proletarian origin of International Women's Day - the workers must go beyond the complaints and fury Against domain and subjugation, which shelters all women regardless of whether they are explorators or exploited, and resume the flags of the struggles that gave rise to 8m.
  </p>
<p>
   To my regret, within this day it was not possible the speeches and the proposals that make the entire female movement to move forward in the fight. The difficulty in organizing a revolutionary female block underwent us to feel our voices before empty proposal slogans.
  </p>
<p>
   As a proletarian woman I consider that we cannot continue allowing the 8M to remain blurred, it is essential «March of the 20,000», a work strike in the New York shirt industry, declared on November 23, 1909 and that lasted 11 weeks, being the first largest strike of women in the US. The proletarian and peasant women must recover the ardor of the Russian women of 1917, when an 8m street went to the slogans "bread and peace", "below the tsar and down the war."
  </p>
<p>
   Women below we must go beyond the slogans against oppression; To those we must add our own slogans against the hell of exploitation, because as women of the working class we fight against economic and class relations imposed by the bloodthirsty capitalist system.
  </p>
<p>
   That in the 8M he did not get to one of our famous women: Comrade Clara Zetkin, who always urged our entire class to understand the situation of working women and, in that sense, not to put aside the true struggles and slogans of proletarian women, who do not focus exclusively on the consequences and manifestations of the power of capital over women: macho oppression, but also address the real causes of the daily suffering of all proletarians and our deepest desires: the economic exploitation and destruction of the entire bourgeois order.
  </p>
<p>
   And it cannot be otherwise, when in Colombia, capitalism is a conviction for 39.1 % of women over 15 who are not studying or have their own income, while that only happens to 16, 7 % of men. That the powerful voice of proletarian women claims in the streets, 8m and every day, that ends the obstacles that women must face to access their own income and conquer economic independence.
  </p>
<p>
   That the powerful voice of proletarian women denounced in the streets, 8m and every day, that lazy capital and swells with unpaid work that remains a disproportionate burden for women in Colombia and the world. According to statistics, the global working charge of women in the country is 14 hours and 49 minutes per day, and 49 % of this burden corresponds to unpaid work, which includes domestic and care work. This situation, which is part of the double exploitation faced by women in this society, shone by their absence in the slogans and songs of bourgeois feminism east 8m.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    It is essential to transcend the slogans that only emphasize the oppression of women in relationships, family and society and recognize double exploitation; Proletarian women demand concrete claims that address salary inequality, precarious working conditions and poorly paid or unpaid work, as well as subsidies and economic support for victims of gender violence.
   </p>
<p>
    I had never attended an 8M march, for the reasons stated above, but attending the last revealed the need for a more inclusive and truly combative female movement, which recognizes and represents the fair struggles of working women. A female movement that understands that only through a true economic and social emancipation we can achieve gender equality and justice for women.
   </p>

  The Brazilian reactionary military announced on March 12 that they will hold a 1964 Pro-Golpe Military celebration on the 27th of the same month, in the form of a lunch to celebrate the “democratic movement of March 31, 1964”. The invitation is accompanied by the motto "The story does not go out or rewrite itself," perhaps a clear and mocking message to the government, which canceled all critical events to the coup under the indecent justification of not wanting to "break the story." In addition to the eating, the event will feature a speech by General Maynard Marques de Santa Rosa, former secretary of Bolsonaro government strategic affairs known for the favorable positions for military intervention in scenarios of political crisis and contrary to investigations into military regime crimes.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘March 1964: patriotism, decision and courage’
 </h4>
<p>
  Last year, when the reactionary armed forces sought to give a false air of “legalism” and curb the far-right shakes in the barracks (to consolidate the position of the hegemonic right, also a coup, about troops) by banning manifestations in barracks in Support of the regime, Santa Rosa published in the militaristic magazine “Defense.net” an article entitled “March 31, 1964 - Patriotism, Decision and Courage”.
 </p>
<p>
  The article teaches dishonesty and historical falsifying classes. It begins by saying that "the memory of 1964 remains as present as repressed by the dominant insecurity." It also states that “proven is that an idea can only be overcome by another better idea. And yet, there is no substitute for the ideal of 1964 ”.
 </p>
<p>
  By severe ignorance about Brazil's military history or simple mythomania, Rosa points out that this ideal “began with the 1920s tender movement”. A historical absurdity, compare the tender movement, the result of the democratic aspirations of much of the young official, contrary to the feudal oligarchies, imperialism and the absurd perks of high officiality (currently), with the counter-infringe, pro-latifundal coup and Subservient culminated in 64. The General must have forgotten that part of the young low official composed, between 1924 and 1927, precisely the Prestes column, the extraordinary military and the main diffuser of democratic-bourgeois aspirations for the country at that time. And then, many, betrayed by the maneuver with Vargas's tender movement, added to the National Liberating Alliance, directed by the Communist Party of Brazil (P.C.B.), and took part in the Epopeic Levante of 1935.
 </p>
<p>
  The article continues with the economic lies of “economic growth” during the military regime, a false miracle that has inherited an overwhelming foreign debt, and points out that the “legacy” of 1964 “remains alive and inplay, for example of the honor of a generation to future generations ”.
 </p>
<p>
  The end of the text is in tone of calling: after condemning punishment to the green chickens who participated in 8/1 and pointing to the political crisis of the country, concludes: “How can not an intense dream, a vivid lightning of love and hope can not be Remaining eternally suffocated, after the ongoing catharsis and under the influx of the historical example, it will again shine the sun of freedom in folding rays, so that Brazil finds the path of fraternity and progress. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Armed Forces must intervene’
 </h4>
<p>
  In previous years, Santa Rosa left no doubt which way he thinks as necessary to reach "fraternity and progress."
 </p>
<p>
  In an interview with the reactionary magazine
  <a href="https://crusoe.com.br/edicoes/172/falta-equilibrio-nos-tres-poderes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   CRUSOÉ
  </a>
  (which has villas-boas as one of the columnists) in 2021, Santa Rosa made it clear that, facing an “institutional impasse”, generated by “one of the powers refusing to comply with the other's decision”, “the only visible alternative is Article 142 of the Constitution ”.
 </p>
<p>
  To be even clearer, he explains: “What we are seeing is a president who acts with words, the STF who acts an act and a congress that acts by omission. This is generating an unstable climate. ” “If there is a rupture of the order at some point, unfortunately, there will be a control operation. And then the Armed Forces will be required to act. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Calunia Commission’
 </h4>
<p>
  Santa Rosa also stood out in his career for the firm opposition to investigations of the crimes of the military regime and punishment to the torturers and killers of the period.
 </p>
<p>
  In the years of operation of the Truth Commission, the fascist military dictatorship described the commission as a “slander commission”, composed of “fanatics that, in the recent past, adopted terrorism, the kidnapping of innocents and bank robbery as a medium to combat the regime the regime to achieve power. ”
 </p>
<p>
  In the same period, it was also known to say that the torture records during the regime were exaggeration. “No military man tortured anyone. If there was, it was at DOPS, ”he said in an interview with Folha de São Paulo in 2010. Then he said that torture of boys and girls, some pregnant women, was“ product of imagination ”. Again, clear historical falsification, facing the evidence raised by the committee itself, relatives of regime victims and researchers and journalists dealing with the subject, such as Tatiana Merlino, organizer of two books on the subject.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Graduated in coup
 </h4>
<p>
  All this foundation of Rose is no wonder, but the result of years in Brazilian reactionary military schools. Started in the academies during the regime, Rosa studied the Black Needles Military Academy (AMAN) between 1964 to 1967, then the Officer Improvement School in 1977 and the Army Command and Staff School between 1980 and 1981. Thus, graduated in the reactionary armed forces courses, well known for their scammer curricula, unchanged to this day, focused on the tutelage of the nation and the fight against the “internal enemy”.
 </p>
<p>
  Rosa also went through schools taught by Yankee imperialism: between 1988 and 1989, he studied in the
  <em>
   US Army War College
  </em>
  . It is also registered in historical studies such as the courses taught by the Yankee Army to the Latin American Reactionary Military people carry the same curriculum of internal protection and counter -injury, as well as subservience to USA. The phenomenon is widely explored by Nelson Werneck Sodré in the book
  <a href="https://lojadoand.com.br/produtos/governomilitarsecreto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   The secret military government
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  With all this history, it is easy to imagine what Santa Rosa will speak to those present at the event on March 27, components of a close and well -receptive audience, if not already agreeing, with their opinions.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  People condemn the regime
 </h4>
<p>
  Meanwhile, the government
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/silvio-almeida-aceita-ordem-de-luiz-inacio-e-cancela-evento-condenatorio-do-regime-militar-nos-60-anos-do-periodo/">
   tries to force everyone to shut up in criticism of the regime
  </a>
  but fails.
 </p>
<p>
  Institutional celebrations may not occur, but throughout Brazil different sectors of the people and popular, democratic or revolutionary organizations already announce manifestations, protests and political acts of condemnation to the military regime and the coup yesterday and today.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  On March 11, after the delay of salary payment, workers at the São Pedro Psychiatric Hospital, which is located in the Parthenon neighborhood of Porto Alegre, broke the institution's electronic point clock in the form of protest. It is the second consecutive month that salary delay occurs.
 </p>
<p>
  Workers say lack of payment is the responsibility of the government, which blocked more than $ 400,000 to be passed on to outsourced service companies. More than 150 hospital staff are backwards, and this is the second time the situation has repeated this year.
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, outsourced companies have also stopped paying employees at the São Pedro Psychiatric Hospital at other times. In 2019, hospital staff protested in Porto Alegre after salary delays caused because companies did not close the grades necessary for transfers.
 </p>
<p>
  Other important fights have already occurred at the hospital. At the end of last year, nurses from the institution protested against the government of Eduardo Leite (PSDB) for the implementation of the nursing floor.
 </p>
<p>
  The health of Rio Grande do Sul has been progressively scrapped by neglect and lack of funding, which in recent years has sharpened the mobilization, especially hospital staff, for the class struggle. In April 2023, officials from the Porto Alegre Institute of Cardiology, went on strike after the salary delay. The institution's response was the resignation of 280 hospital workers at the end of the year in December. The climate at the Institute follows indignation and protest.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What is happening in Palestine is a genocide that has 
 characters of a real catastrophe. Richard Brennan, 
 Regional Director of the World Health Organization, Ha 
 said: “We are short of adjectives to describe the situation of 
 Gaza. Do we mean apocalyptic? We are beyond the catastrophe ". From 
 Over 30,000 Palestinians killed in the genocidal operation of the state 
 Nazi of Israel type Zionist, over 65% are women and 
 children. According to other sources, such as the United Nations UNRWA, the 
 number of children who died in this operation is greater than all 
 Children who died in all the last wars in recent years.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “There are beyond 
 70,000 wounded of war difficult to manage and the Institute of Medicine 
 International speaks of 85,000 possible deaths in the next six months 
 For unused trauma, diseases and mistreatment, for conditions 
 chronic not received, there were 36 hospitals in Gaza, today there are 12, for 
 more partially functioning and moreover with an accounting 
 Always to be updated due to the bombing. The hospital of 
 Al-Najah has 65 beds and hosts 300 sick people. I don't think I ever have 
 Assisted to nothing like this, "says Richard Brennan.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time, the same official says that a displacement like that of 
 Rafah had never seen him, nor had he seen offensive that 
 They force hospitals to evacuate en masse. "80% of the 
 population has been pushed to smaller areas e 
 overcrowded. In Rafah there is currently a bathroom every 400-600 
 People, outdoor defecation is widespread. For this they are in 
 epidemics course of

 diarrhea and hepatitis. We fear others. Before the 
 War the vaccinations rate in Gaza was very high, now it has jumped 
 All. A possible measles epidemic among malnutrite children 
 it could be highly fatal .... 15.5% of children under the two 
 years is seriously malnourish in this sense. In the face of this 
 aid are clearly insufficient and the promises of aid come 
 placed in times that are not suitable for the emergency situation 
 Absolute ".
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The initiatives of 
 aid parachute from above or the so -called port for aid 
 proposed by the United States reveal all the hypocrisy of this 
 operation, because the United States are the main supporters of the 
 Genocida plan of Israel and most of the weapons that the state 
 of Israel USA in these operations are of origin of the States 
 United, weapons that are continuously powered and therefore give the 
 State of Israel the possibility of a genocidal military activity 
 almost unlimited. How much hypocrisy of those who on the one hand kills e 
 Devasta and on the other he claims to help populations!
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are 
 unconditionally favorable to the ceasefire and upon arrival in the 
 Gaza strip of all humanitarian operations of any 
 type. The fundamental point is that it is necessary to support in all 
 ways the armed resistance of the Palestinian people because in the face of 
 This operation is nothing more than armed resistance.
 </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Imperialism has 
 clear all this, so much so that it is operating to block, 
 repress solidarity with the Palestinian people. In different countries 
 Imperialists the events are prohibited or put in difficulty. 
 And there is a campaign of persecution and criminalization towards the 
 same manifestations.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In our country 
 Things so far have gone better for a weave of problems, from a 
 side the strength of solidarity. There would be no doubt that 
 Any survey-Referendum would allow you to verify how much 
 great in our country solidarity at all levels with 
 the Palestinian people and the complaint of the genocidal plan of Israel, 
 regardless of the position, which can be differentiated 
 In the proletarian files, of the people, of the action of the Resistance 
 Palestinian.

  The Meloni government 
 It is strictly aligned with the state of Israel, it is an accomplice, the 
 Provides weapons, it is an integral part of the developed operation 
 from American imperialism, of which he is strictly ally and servant. 
 This government is increasingly intended to align with the address 
 to stop not genocide but solidarity with resistance 
 Palestinian.
  <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In these two 
 days the case of L'Aquila emerged where, in the face of one 
 growing mobilization of solidarity with a political prisoner 
 Palestinian arrested in our country and at risk of extradition in 
 These hours, faced with solidarity initiatives, the government 
 Instead of welcoming the requests of the political prisoner 
 Palestinian of refusal of extract and the campaign of 
 solidarity that exists towards it, widens the operation 
 repressive towards other Palestinians accusing them of being terrorists, 
 to prepare actions against Italy and Israel, to refer to one 
 of the organizations of the Palestinian resistance, an integral part 
 of the action of 7 October.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   It is, beyond 
 there of everything, of a repressive operation for which they stop 
 people accused of nothing, because no action of character 
 military or unworthy of "terrorism" has never occurred 
 in our country that justifies this operation, while on the other 
 The right of the Palestinian people and its organizations of 
 Responding to the war of aggression and genocide of Israel is 
 unlimited, as is unlimited the type of action that Israel carries out 
 on a world scale, also through services, in persecution 
 of Palestinian organizations.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The right to 
 Hit Israel objectives is legitimate and is an integral part 
 of the response of the resistance to the war of genocidal aggression 
 of the state of Israel and therefore it must be defended as such. 
 The operation against these Palestinian companions is an operation of 
 general intimidation towards the Palestinians in our country that 
 they are going down massively in the square and in particular in the 
 City of Milan where, since after 7 October, events every Saturday 
 very large, constant, with the participation not only of the 
 Palestinians, but of all the social and political realities that are 
 solidarity, they follow one another, making Milan a sort of capital 
 of solidarity with the Resistance and in Milan there was also one 
 National event on February 24, very participated.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   It's clear that 
 They want to stop these manifestations and you want, through the 
 same operation of L'Aquila, prepare a campaign of 
 criminalization towards Palestinian realities that in our country 
 they are descending to the square with the heart and soul for what 
 It happens in Gaza.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Because of this 
 it is absolutely necessary to reject, denounce, the repressive operation 
 de L'Aquila. We are all terrorists if they accuse themselves of terrorism i 
 Palestinian companions arrested in L'Aquila.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Furthermore, one 
 of political prisoners is the reason for the national campaign, 
 also international, existing to prevent it from being extradited.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The true 
 Terrorism are the bombs of imperialism!
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The terrorism of 
 Nazi character and which recalls the genocide, the holocaust, is that 
 of the state of Israel. This genocide of the state of Israel is 
 Also under accusation to the Court of Justice of the Hague.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Condemn, 
 hit the Palestinians, even if it were true that their purpose is to 
 contribute to the Palestinian resistance all over the world, it is like 
 wanting to hit those who developed the resistance against Nazism and the 
 Fascism in this country. As far as the situations are extremely 
 different, the reference to the fact that the Palestinians are the partisans of 
 This battle is a right and historically valid call. So 
 The Operation of L'Aquila must fall and the mobilization for the 
 liberation of these Palestinian brothers of ours must extend 
 in all cities.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   This is 
 necessary because, like the Operation of L'Aquila is an operation 
 preventive, intimidative towards the entire movement, it is clear that a 
 prevention of repressive operations, prohibitions and persecutions that 
 can affect the Palestinian community, the supportive people in ours 
 country, it must be the same. So we are because in 
 particular in the events of this Saturday, in Milan as 
 elsewhere and in the period of new events that in all cities 
 Italian solidarity forces are promoting, is put big 
 evidence the request for liberation for the Palestinian companions 
 arrested in L'Aquila.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The level of 
 crime that develops by the state of Israel towards i 
 political prisoners. Today all the newspapers appear images 
 unequivocal of the doctors, who have been denuded, kept in the cold, 
 held naked prisoners. The title of the Manifesto, says: “Medici 
 abused ".
  </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    That conduct 
 against the Palestinian people is a war, a war against a 
 whole people reminiscent of the worst pages of history 
 of humanity. As much as we all are aspiring to peace, it is necessary 
 consider that wars, as it was for Nazism, how it is 
 been for other historical episodes of this country, think of Vietnam, 
 Those who want peace must respond with the war, because only the 
 the right war, the war of peoples, can stop the march of the 
 wars, reactionary wars, antipopolar genocide, 
 imperialist.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    This does not apply 
 Only in Palestine, it also applies to Ukraine, applies to all scenarios 
 where the monster of the war, the tendency to a third world war, 
 It is developing and approaching.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    War 
 world, the aggression wars of the peoples produce of 
 consequently a gigantic waste of money and funds for weapons, on 
 This I will speak briefly.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    World spending 
 In 2023 it increased for the ninth consecutive year in real terms, 
 A sum that approaches $ 2500 billion. The director 
 of the Sipri, the International Institute of Research on Peace of 
 Stockholm, he says that this expense will increase this year and for the 
 next years.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    The expense of 
 wars is bringing the war industries, the top players how they come 
 calls, widens in particular in Europe, the 345 business 
 billions of dollars and splash the wallets, organs of the greats 
 player, Il Sole 24 Ore of February 28 highlights the relationship between 
 war and profits, an organic, historical, structural relationship of 
 capitalist and imperialist production. Just looking 
 the trend of the drafts and taking into consideration the period from 
 January 2 to 26 February 2024, Il Sole 24 Ore publishes the 
 percentages of growth in the profits of the war industry. On the first 
 place there is the Rheinmetall, a German industry +394% of profits, 
 Then Saab, Leonardo is in third place.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    It is more than 
 justified, therefore, that in many realities have begun and yes 
 develop initiatives against Leonardo, the complaints. 
 Leonardo is the heart of the war industry in our country, 
 sting of the war economy in this country which is useless to repeat that they are billions spent on weapons and for the 
 war that counterbalance the money that is spent for the 
 health, school, work, in the face of wages that decrease 
 in our country also for the caravan, in the face of governments that 
 attack citizenship income, which deny the minimum wage e 
 then they push the population towards relative and absolute poverty 
 and in particular the poorest, less protected masses, in ours 
 country: over 5 million workers in our country are who 
 take wages from hunger, insufficient salaries not only for not 
 get to the end of the month, but which make a life almost impossible 
 decent.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    In the face of everything 
 This we have our governments, our states, which they fill 
 of money, of orders, the military industries and primarily the Leonardo, 
 our government like other governments in the world because the 
 military industries are global industries that sell weapons everywhere and 
 In all shapes and ways.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    So the 
 Leonardo as the heart of the war system is an industry that must 
 be more and more subject to initiatives of struggle, of denunciation, e 
 Not only of denunciation, in all large and small realities in this 
 village. In the new cycle of solidarity initiatives with the people 
 Palestinian will be necessary, precisely in order not to make only 
 repetitive and not only expressive of the feeling of solidarity 
 of our people, they must become more incisive, more targeted and 
 So even the Leonardo issue of the war industry must be 
 Very clear in the agenda of the next mobilization for Palestine.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    The Leonardo is also a company managed by men of the governments 
 and the war industries.
   </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Solidarity with 
 Palestine, fight against war and the war industry, with al 
 LEONARDO CENTRO, RELATIONSHIP between this situation and the more general 
 international situation, relationship between this situation and the 
 economic situation in our country, a relationship between this situation 
 and the worsening of the conditions of salary, work, schools, 
 of social services for popular masses.
    </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Among all this 
 There is a link and this link must be highlighted in the 
 mobilization of all those who do not agree with this state 
 of existing things.

   March 18 - day of solidarity with political prisoners -
  </strong>
<br>

   In honor of the communist and revolutionary prisoners
  </strong>
</br></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  On March 18, the International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Red Help was founded by the Comintern in 1920 and declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the founding of the Paris Community, for "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity is expressed with political prisoners around the world.

     The reactionary Indian state has blocked over 10,000 communist, revolutionary and political activists inside, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent the People's War.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, even though he has endured his punishment. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners from oppressed people from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     The fears of the ruling classes of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enemy they feel to them is so great that they ruthlessly prevent the communists and revolutionaries whom they hold trapped in obvious battle with their own laws from leaving prisons. The murder of chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of PCP, who lost his health after 29 years in isolation prison, and whose death was due to the fact that the necessary measures were not taken is very important to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred that the imperialists and the servile owners of the ruling system feel. Those responsible for chairman Gonzalo's death burned and even crushed his corpse.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     The communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the demands of the class struggle with the danger of their lives by going to the limit of prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation imprisonment. We must mobilize ourselves to support the legitimate battle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against any kind of aggression against the prisoners, to be the prisoners' voice outside, we must support their struggle under the prison conditions as part of the class fight outside.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      The communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">

      Supporting the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle!

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid confirmed, in an award-winning report to the Federal Police (PF), that Bolsonaro held at least five meetings with high-ranking military personnel to discuss coup plans. The information, released in a column of Bela Megale, from the monopolistic newspaper O Globo, at the same time reveals the level of participation of military personnel in high-right scammers, and prove the knowledge and omission of other generals about institutional breakup .
 </p>
<p>
  The first reported meeting took place in July 2022. With the presence of ministers and military, it was in it that Bolsonaro announced widely a coup plan and generals like Augusto Heleno said that if it were "to turn the table", it would have to be "before the elections ”. A complete filming of the meeting, which recorded the positions of other ministers and military favorable to rupture, was found on the CID computer and made available in the full press last month.
 </p>
<p>
  Another meeting was on December 7, 2022, in which the commanders of the Armed Forces participated. In it, Bolsonaro presented the so -called “scam draft” to the commanders, and Admiral Almir Garnier agreed to make the troops available to Bolsonaro. This meeting is one of the central evidence that the former Army commander, now regarded as “legalist” by certain sectors committed to the barracks, was fully aware of institutional rupture plans. It is also known that other generals, as were theophilo, attended meetings with the same content at Gomes' request. The versions put the image that the former commander seeks to propagate about himself as "contrary to the coup." At most, Freire Gomes was against (but did nothing to prevent) the break, but cabled several movements in favor of the intervention of the Armed Forces High Command in national political life, as designed by the preferable generals of a veiled coup in the country.
 </p>
<p>
  Already at the end of the year, Bolsonaro met twice with officers to think about the performance of the reactionary military in far-right demonstrations. One of them occurred with the major -trained major in the special forces (
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  Black), Rafael Martins, in Brasilia, on December 12th. Martins is known for requesting, days after the meeting, R $ 100,000 to Mauro Cid to play the trip of green chickens to Brasilia and have requested guidance from “places for demonstrations”, where
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  Black would act with the far-right celeds. At 12/12 meeting, the major discussed Bolsonaro “matters related to the coup strategy”, according to information released by Megale. The second meeting of this type took place on 12/28 and featured Colonel Bernardo Romão Correia Neto, assistant to the Southern Military Command and formed in the "Special Forces". In addition to Romão, advisers of generals favorable to the coup and other special forces attended the meeting. According to Cid, Romão was responsible for selecting the guests for the meeting.
 </p>
<p>
  In the background, there is just again in the new information revealed about the ICD denunciation. However, it is important, however, the reschedule of proof of the omission of generals such as Freire Gomes in the face of institutional rupture, precisely because they are not essentially disagreeing with the coup. Just disagree with how to do it and when to do so. In addition, it is noteworthy how the list of high official military personnel that proven to take part in the plans of institutional rupture is growing, also proves the coup essence of the Brazilian Armed Forces, widespread from above the military institution. The names range from generals, or not intermediated by advisors, to colonels and major.

  The Greek government with its decision to send the frigate "Hydra" to the Red Sea as part of the European Union's mission Eunavfor Aspides escalates the country's involvement in imperialist philosopher war designs. After all, the operational center of the mission is in Larissa and at the same time the base of Souda and other American bases in our country are actively involved in the genocide of the Palestinian people, in every way reinforcing the fascist-Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  Already the frigate of the Navy on Wednesday 13/3 involved in the first war in the Red Sea war, taking rocket shots at Houthi's unmanned drones. The Minister of National Defense N. Dendias said with cynicism that "we are proud of the businesses of our homeland that are being carried out to protect the national interest ...".
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   The ND government, bourgeois political staff and local capitalist order are dangerous. They drag our people into war. They are preparing us to bleed again for the interests of American and European imperialists. On the one hand, Mr Mitsotakis' visit to Ukraine as a US medium and the mission of war equipment. On the other hand, the country's accession to the US geopolitical planning for the NA Mediterranean and the Middle East now accompanied by the Navy. They drag the country and the people at the center of imperialist competition for the world's re-firming, baptizing a national interest in the US-EU.
  </p>
<p>
   At the same time that the government, on behalf of the foreign and local capital, escalates the attack on the rights of the people by sowing poverty, poverty, accuracy, fills the funds of the imperialist war industries with two -euro. On this basis, the lives of the people and the workers will continue to sacrifice on the altar of profit. Like the lives of the two Greek seafarers, they were sacrificed for the profits of Greek shipowners, while the government and the system celebrate the success of the Greek frigate Hydra, one of the "Navy of our Navy", during its involvement two unmanned aircraft.
  </p>
<p>
   The people, the workers and the youth will not become meat in the cannons of imperialists. There is a greater need than ever to grow and massive an anti-imperialist movement that requires the country to be unraveled by imperialist war plans that struggle to leave the imperialists from the country that declare its tangible solidarity. In the struggle of the Palestinian people!

  A new aggression against students from the “Raúl Isidro Burgos” Rural Normal School in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero has taken the life of a student from the mentioned institution. On the night of 7
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, elements of the state police of the mentioned entity opened fire against a private vehicle where three young normal students were traveling. In the events, the Yankee student Kothan Gómez Peralta was murdered and another student named Osiel “N” was arrested, who according to versions of comrade Vidulfo Rosales, lawyer for the Tlachinollan organization and legal advisor to the committee of fathers and mothers of the 43… “
  <em>
   He was being beaten, he was being threatened and they were forcing him. The state police were insisting

<em>
   to make him declare himself
  </em>
<em>
   guilty
  </em>
<em>
   of
  </em>
<em>
   having carried weapons and having fired shots.”
  </em>
  According to the state police of Guerrero, the young people were armed and driving a stolen vehicle from where they allegedly shot at the uniformed officers at a checkpoint on the old Tixlta pass, very close to the exit of Chilpancingo, capital of the entity. This version is a hoax set up by the narco-big landlord government of Guerrero, and has already been denied by AMLO himself who this morning acknowledged that the expert tests carried out confirm that the murdered student did not fire any weapon and that the case will be brought by the FGR

  and it is a setup to blame the comrades. This occurs in an important political context for the normal school. On the one hand, the school celebrates 98 years since its foundation, proudly carrying the epithet of “

  of March we carried out the first phase of our

  <strong>
   Flood the streets and squares with red flags!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  As we have said
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/03/mexico-statement-on-the-day-of-struggle/">
   before
  </a>
  , this mobilization has been a response to the lack of solution to the demands for justice and the repression that hovers over the popular movement and the peoples of Oaxaca.
 </p>
<p>
  In this way, the contingents from regions such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Basin, the Coast, the Sierra Sur, the Mixteca and the Central Valleys came together fulfilling the method:
  <strong>
   Task set, task accomplished!

<p>
  At 8:00 a.m. our contingents began the mass rally at the Zonal Market of Santa Rosa Panzacola, which has been a historical reference point for our mobilizations. In this place, the comrades of the People’s Youth Brigades placed a large Palestinian flag on the stairs of the pedestrian bridge as an expression of recognition of the heroic national liberation struggle carried out by the Palestinian National Resistance. Our democratic organization greets the exemplary counter-offensive “Al-Aqsa Flood” initiated on the 7
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of October, 2023 and sustained until today with courageous armed actions against the Zionist invader.
  <strong>
   From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!

  At 9:30 a.m. our contingents began to prepare for the momentary blockade of the international highway. Revolutionary activists made some graffiti greeting the International Communist League, which announced its constitution to the world in December of 2022.

<p>
  Our march began at 10:00 a.m. and immediately the red flags were unfolded on the international highway. As it went on, other contingents of comrades joined in, thickening the ranks. The youth continued to paint the slogans:
  <em>
<strong>
    “The Interoceanic Corridor dispossesses and kills poor and indigenous peasants!”
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    Hands off
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    Goes for! "
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “Whoever governs, the rights of the people are defended!”
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “Boycott the bourgeois electoral farce!”
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “Don’t vote, organize and
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    struggle!
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    “
   </strong>
</em>
  , among others.
 </p>
<p>
  As it went on, the masses were removing electoral propaganda of various candidates and parties. The amount of public money that is spent on the electoral circus of the big bourgeoisie is outrageous; money that the candidates and parties invest in propaganda, advertising, stationery, etc. and which are useless for the people since they only generate garbage while the popular neighborhoods and communities lack public services and, in addition, Oaxaca is suffering a wave of fires at this moment. An example is the communities of San Lucas Quiaviní, San Pablo Güila, Santiago Matatlán, San Dionicio Ocotepec, among others, whose forests and communal lands have been devastated by fire, showing the technical incapacity of the State, which does not have sufficient logistics and infrastructure to face these disasters, some of them caused by the latifundium and illegal loggers. Perhaps there are no resources to prevent and quell forest fires, but there is a budget for the electoral circus.
  <strong>
   That
  </strong>
<strong>
   is why the people reject it!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The march stopped at the PRI headquarters and a brief rally was held there where the comrades recalled the responsibility of this party in the war against the people, particularly during the dirty war that lasted from 1965 to the end of the 80s, and also its responsibility in the counterinsurgency actions against the Zapatista uprising and the EZLN, against the EPR uprising, against the UNAM strike and against the mass movements such as the APPO in 2006 in Oaxaca.
 </p>
<p>
  There the activists shouted slogans and painted graffiti. A gigantic rat was drawn on the entrance door with the caption “garbage dump of history”; all the electoral propaganda was also deposited there and finally the people set fire to it as part of the actions of the boycott against the bourgeois electoral farce.
 </p>
<p>
  The march continued towards the main square of the city and during its route thousands of leaflets were distributed explaining to the people our organization’s demands for justice, denouncing the war against the people and call not to vote. The contingents arrived at 12:45 p.m. and the esplanade was immediately filled; there a rally was held and the masses took over the palace of ignominy (or government palace). At the end of the rally, tents were set up, a central module and stalls of our comrades, artisans and street vendors violently evicted by the municipal and state police on the 17
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February on the Gurrión avenue were placed.
  <strong>
   The sit-in is a form of protest and frees spaces, returning them to the people in struggle!
  </strong>
  The friends of the League of Communities for the Agrarian Revolution set up a small stand where they exhibited organic products grown by the peasants in the communities in resistance, which are 100% free of agro-chemicals and support the rescue of native seeds.
 </p>
<p>
  Later, a political-cultural event was held while an enlarged dialogue commission appointed by our organization entered the palace of ignominy to state the demands for justice and the demand their solution.

  In our political-cultural event we had the participation of the BJP who interpreted revolutionary poetry, in addition a presentation was made on the 153

<p>
  In the morning, after breakfast and the general organization of the contingent, a mass assembly was held in the University Gymnasium of the UABJO in the historic center, which was packed by the sea of red flags that immediately took possession of all the stairs and corridors where the dialogue commission gave a detailed report of the points of discussion with the State and federal government,  as well as the different routes of attention to the various issues. Among these, the most outstanding are the demand for the presentation alive of our comrade Dr. Ernesto Sernas García. who was a professor at precisely this University and was forcefully disappeared on the 10
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of May, 2018; justice and punishment for the material and intellectual authors of the murders of our comrades Luis Armando Fuentes Aquino (11
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of April, 2019), Jesús Manuel García Martínez (23
  <sup>
   rd
  </sup>
  of October, 2022) and Félix Vicente Cruz (1
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of April, 2023), respectively; in addition to the integral reparation of damages to the displaced Triqui families of San Miguel Copala and the fulfillment of the different recommendations, among these the arbitrary detention and torture of our comrades who were political prisoners accused of terrorism and carrying explosives for the reserved use of the Mexican army.
 </p>
<p>
  The assembly continued until shortly after 12:00 p.m., agreeing to recess this first phase of our
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle in Defense of the Rights of the People
  </strong>
  , maintaining the sit-in on the Gurrión walkway and announcing that on the 10
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of April and the 14
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of May, respectively, the second phase will begin with new regional actions to demand justice for our murdered and disappeared comrades, respectively.

  Clearly our democratic organization holds high its flags, which are the red flags of the
  <strong>
   New Democratic Revolution
  </strong>
  , agrarian and anti-imperialist, uninterrupted towards
  <strong>
   Socialism
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  This first phase of our
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle
  </strong>
  has also been a call to the working people, encouraging them to trust in their own forces and call them to the organized struggle to stop the war against the people, rejecting the bourgeois electoral farce. It is also a way of marking fire against reformism and contemporary revisionism which is already taking up its eternal chant of calling the bourgeois elections “a form of struggle”, joining the last wagon of the electoral train legitimizing the regime. We insist:
  <strong>
   Elections are not the solution, the solution is revolution!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Incidents.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  No major incidents were recorded, except for the aggression of some fully identified provocateurs who from a store on the international highway threw objects at the contingent and the media, who witnessed the aggression and the well-deserved response of the masses. These individuals have been allies of the local PRI and as good acrobats they are now in Morena; they have always been historical enemies of the people’s movement since the times of the APPO and the people of Oaxaca will never forget that.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also important to mention that we no longer find the metal fences that were placed days ago on the entrance streets to the esplanade of the main square.
 </p>
<p>
  We again salute our class and our people; the heroic Palestinian people and their exemplary national liberation struggle; the ongoing people’s wars in Peru, Turkey, India and the Philippines; and the workers and peoples rising up against exploitation and oppression. We strongly salute the efforts to constitute the Anti-Imperialist League at the international level and maintain:
  <strong>
   Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Stop the war against the people!
   <br>
   Don’t vote, organize and struggle!
  </br></strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Whoever governs, the rights of the people are defended!
   <br>
   With the Red Sun the people will win!

  While ruin, unemployment, dispossession, looting, drought, paramilitarism, criminal violence, militarization, murders, femicides, disappearances, etc. The great bourgeoisie is stopped with its electoral campaigns where more than 60 thousand 451 million pesos are waste, which could well be invested in public services, education and health for the masses.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The elections in Mexico are the most expensive in the world and it is evident that the needs of the people are not a priority for the old state of landowners and great bourgeois despite the story of the political alternation in this country where governments have already paraded of the PRI, Pan and now Morena.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Once again, none of the coalitions or parties of the great bourgeoisie, none of its representatives (without gender distinction) has the capacity or interest in solving the problems that afflict the poor people.
  <strong>
   Neither Claudia, nor Xóchitl, nor are Jorge an alternative of anything!
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Moreover, the elections in our country have the characteristic of being particularly violent, since the different bourgeois factions often contend not only at the polls but also in weapons. This is clear with the current data: from the beginning of the pre-campaigns last November until March 6 of this year, there are already 23 homicides of different politicians, 13 of them sighs to some position and 10 more that served as public servants or political operators. It is clear that the figure will not remain there and the longer the fatal date of June 2 without a doubt we will know more about this. It is the usual, the bourgeois electoral farce in Mexico Chorrea blood in each of its episodes.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The people know this, which is why they are once again challenging bourgeois legality by embracing the call for a boycott against the electoral farce.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Here we share some of the first actions carried out by the town in different parts of the country.

  On February 21, a group of people threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the facilities of the Institute of Elections and Citizen Participation in Chiapas (IEPC). The fire managed to consume part of the electoral stationery and furniture inside the building. The action prompted a response from firefighters, state police and the National Guard who immediately arrived to put out the flames.

  On March 4, during a mobilization where around a thousand people participated, the masses withdrew electoral propaganda from various parties making a -mit stop in front of the PRI state offices. In that place they were painted by the boycott and the withdrawal propaganda was deposited by setting fire in the midst of multiple slogans such as
  <strong>
   "The elections are not the solution, the solution is the revolution!"
  </strong>
  y
  <strong>
   "Do not vote, do not vote, prepare to fight!"

  Within the framework of the plant held by the fathers and mothers of the 43 together with other democratic organizations, the classmates of the Federation of Socialist students of Mexico (FECSM) have accompanied the actions raising their combativity. On March 6, the normalistas took a CFE truck and after a jaloneo with the City Police and the Military Police managed to demolish part of the side door of the National Palace. The FECSM continues to increase actions for the electoral process considering that on September 26, 10 years of the forced disappearance of their peers will be completed. The normalist movement is spearhead in the call to the boycott against the bourgeois electoral farce.

  While the contradiction between the popular masses and the old state is deepened, the trend is the exacerbation of the class struggle in the perspective of the New Democracy Revolution, breaking with the patrañas of the regime and its false democracy.

  These initial actions will surely find echo in other latitudes of national geography reinforcing the path that various peoples have already initiated in the perspective of the liberation of territories and the exercise of embryos again, that is: self -determination, self -government and self -defense.

  On Sunday 10/3, a cancer patient put an end to his life in Heraklion, Crete, because he could no longer wait for a medicine for his chemotherapy .... a medicine who asked him to find himself (!) While he was lack, and while suffering from unbearable pain.
 </p>
<p>
  The Minister of Health, Georgiadis, who did not blame the self -impatience of "impatience", since he did not ... lack this medicine for a long time ...
 </p>
<p>
  Drug deficiencies, and even those who have a very low price, become more and more frequent. It was not long before we did not find baby syrups and penicillins, during a period of viruses, with parents of young children being in despair and not knowing what to do ... The problem was "addressed" with the increase in the price of drugs that They were lacking, since in Greece they were cheap, so their producers were more profitable if they sold them abroad ... So what could they do, to go against their interests?
 </p>
<p>
  The ministry has never explained why the Venette has no competence in medicines that are absolutely necessary and are not replaced by any other formulation. Like, for example, the tallium in some psychiatric diseases, which leave patients without treatment ... He didn't ask for the reason, of course ... the situation is so bad that no one knows what to do!
 </p>
<p>
  How many people, are they not deteriorating their health, waiting for an appointment or to get out of biopsies, to have a scheduled surgery, or to start chemotherapy, or radiation?
 </p>
<p>
  People and workers need to take the situation in our hands! And to fight for equal, complete and free care, for everyone, unconditional and conditions! We cannot wait for those who sacrifice us, at every opportunity, that they will change!

  "Wearing." This should be the German army again. At least when it comes to Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. For this purpose, the Ministry of Defense, which he is subject to, has now submitted a concept paper in which the first measures are taken to advance the Bundeswehr's armament.
 </p>
<p>
  The corresponding document is entitled
  <a href="https://esut.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ergebnisbericht.pdf">
   "Bundeswehr of the future".
  </a>
  In the document, various points are mentioned that must be executed to make the German army "war -related" again. One point of this is, among other things, the strengthening of the sub -forces. Partial forces are a division of the armed forces into various specialized areas. In Germany, the army comprises three partial forces. Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, there will also be a fourth partial dispute that affects the area of the "cyber and information room" in the future.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, there should also be restructuring in the leadership of the operations that aim to strengthen centralization. In the future, an “operational management command of the Bundeswehr” should be created in the future. In the future, as the document means “from a single source”. this operational management command are controlled and coordinated centrally.
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore, under the motto: "The Bundeswehr is a whole to be aligned with the emergency" that the Bundeswehr must be logistically able to be able to wage war at any time. To this end, the military administration should already be planned for “emergencies”. According to a lack of need, such as infrastructure, personnel, material, etc. should be recognized and provided.
 </p>
<p>
  Even if only marginally, the question of conscription is raised in the document. This is how the proposal provides that there should be structural and process changes, especially in the area of personnel. The structures should "largely smooth" and "especially in
  <br>
  Situations of the highest turmoil and large overall coordination effort
  <br>
  be folded off. ”A coordination office for“ controlling the ability to grow up ”is also to be created. This should be able to “quickly the personnel
  <br>
  To be able to ensure the need to cover ". I.e. in a war in a war, young people as cannon food for the German bourgeoisie.
 </br></br></br></p>
<p>
  The creation of such a coordination office is also relevant for a future reintroduction of compulsory military service. As is known, the German defense or one could rather say War Minister Pistorius is a vehement fighter to reintroduce compulsory military service. In the context, it also makes sense that it requires to create structures that are able to be able to work immediately after the introduction of such a compulsory military service.
 </p>
<p>
  Ultimately, it can be said that the German bourgeoisie is increasingly cries out after war. The document mentioned already realizes in the introduction that it is not a question of using the Bundeswehr as a defensive army for national defense. So it says:
  <br>
<em>
   “Germany as a global nation in all matters will therefore have to be able to counter threats and destabilizations at home, in Europe and in the world at any time. For this purpose, the Bundeswehr also provides instruments of action. ”
  </em>
<br/>
  Even if it is repeatedly spoken of the "defense" of Germany, it is more about defending the economic interests of German imperialism with fire and lead all over the world against the oppressed peoples and the imperialist competitors. A fact that is confirmed by a look at the current Bundeswehr's current missions.

Marcos Jr. also married in the influential Araneta family.

   . The federal government celebrates the cooperation and calls the Philippines "important partners for Germany in Southeast Asia". One now wants to continue in the economic sector, in particular state German investment guarantees for the capital export of German imperialism are to be expanded, said Chancellor Scholz. The goal is a free trade agreement between the EU and the Philippines, but also the other Asean countries. At the same time, German imperialism strives for cheap workers from the Philippines, especially women in the health sector.

     conference
    </a>
    Scholz spoke, among other things, about Filipino, "which are important for the European and German economy, for example". Marcos Jr. spoke more about military aspects of the meeting. He underlined that "Germany has helped my country's armed forces since 1974". Germany is thus the “second oldest formal formal defense partner of the Philippines, and I have expressed the openness of my government in terms of discussions about a collaboration that concerns
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
     goes beyond training
    </span>
    And also areas such as cyber and maritime areas ”. The construction of capacities and skills of the coast guard by Germany was also requested. On request, Marcos Jr. Underlined: “We also have an intensive exchange with the Federal Republic of Germany in the field of training of the armed forces and the coast guard of my country. We agreed with the Federal Chancellor
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
     that we want to expand that
    </span>
    "He also did not miss the opportunity to invite German imperialist monopolies such as Siemens, Lufthansa, Deutsche Bank, Bayer, Bosch to loot the Philippines.
   </br>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
   German imperialism will therefore promote the exploitation and oppression of the Filipino people in its favor. It is clear and yet deeply judged that a mafioso, such as Schloz, and a murderer, such as Marcos, share such efforts. Such is neither in the interests of the people in Germany nor the Philippines, but diametrically opposed. The revolutionaries in this country have to deceive themselves and fight it, not only with beautiful words, but in concrete deeds, firmly united with the Filipino people and their struggle, everything else would be smooth.

   March 14, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s visit to Berlin on March 13 was met with protests by Filipino migrants.
 </p>
<p>
  ALPAS Pilipinas and GABRIELA-Germany led the protests. It was also attended by allied organizations, such as Solidarity International, ARARAT Armenian Collective, MLPD, German Filipino Friendship, Kurdish Women, Resbak, Philippine Buro and Interburo.
 </p>
<p>
  According to BAYAN-Europe, Marcos Jr’s visit to Germany and other European countries from March 11-15 should serve as an occasion for all Filipino migrants and human rights defenders to condemn the brutal regime that commit gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL).
 </p>
<p>
  “It is wrong to welcome this Marcos junket, the main purpose of which is to deodorize the stinking image of Marcos and his family in the international community,” according to the BAYAN-Europe statement.
 </p>
<p>
  Historically, the allied organizations in Germany have been among the most committed supporters of the movement against the Marcos fascist dictatorship in the 70s and 80s.
 </p>
<p>
  Marcos Jr’s visit is expected to seal negotiations for Germany to supply drones to the Philippines supposedly for maritime security against China. This Military aid will be awarded amid the gross violations of international humanitarian law and heavy militarization and indiscriminate bombing of the countryside perpetrated by the Marcos regime.
 </p>
<p>
  The protesters also called on the European Union to stop supporting the Marcos Jr regime by ending military aid. Germany and the EU are both signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which supplies military aid, weapons and other military equipment to the Philippines.
 </p>
<p>
  It can be recalled that during the Duterte regime, the EU strongly condemned the war on drugs and human rights violations. In February 2022, the EU Parliament issued a resolution that threatened to withdraw the Philippines’ GSP+ and other incentives, such as the benefit of zero tariff (no layer tax) on goods from the EU, if the Duterte regime did not stop the violations. Germany is the largest trading partner of the Philippines in Europe.

 The country's involvement in the war plans of the imperialists is deepening daily. The mission of the Greek frigate to the Red Sea on behalf of the US and the EU has nothing to do with the safeguarding of security, but the exact opposite: it intensifies the war climate triggered by US and EU imperialists, and exposes our people to huge dangers.
 <br>
<br>
 Just yesterday, the ND government, always willing to sacrifice the people for imperialist interests, ratified (with PASOK votes) in Parliament the two Memorandums of Cooperation of the Ministries of Defense, Greece and the US, for the placement of Greek staff. US and US Special Business Administration.
 <br>
<br/>
 On the pretext of conservation of peace and security, the dependent local ruling class and its political staff support and contribute to the peoples of the peoples in Ukraine and Palestine, and have turned the whole country into a US -based basis into a huge base of imperialist. murder machines.
 <br/>
<br/>
 At the same wavelength, the shipbuilding capital sacrifices on the altar of profit the lives of seafarers sent to the Red Sea. The three dead and six injured seafarers are the tranquil proof.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We call on the people and the workers to stand up against this bloodthirsty policy. To denounce the involvement of our country in the war and to make their solidarity with the Palestinian people.

    The KKE is calling on Thursday 14/3 today, at 7pm in the Propylaea, the gathering and march of the provocative prosecutor's prosecution for the 12-year-old Sepolia case, which acquits the victims and condemns the victims!
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>
<span style="font-size: medium;">
    BELOW THE POLICY OF A SYSTEM THAT MAKES-SUPPORT-DIAGNOSIS!
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>
<span style="font-size: medium;">
    Let's be all there ...
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<b>
   Anger and indignation at the prosecutor's vulgar proposal in the 12 -year -old case from Sepolia.
  </b>
  The rape turned into meetings for a 12 -year -old child who were systematically rushed by dozens of adults "above all suspicion". In fact, the 12 -year -old is considered guilty as it is considered to be half of the meeting. The rapist and mastic Micho is considered innocent of the accusations of rape and mastrian. Just "facilitated" the 12 -year -old. All the categories fall into the mother with no doubt.
 </p>
<p>
  The prosecutor's attitude is "consistent". He served the political system and its expressors to the end. Micho knows and hides many and powerful. ND local commander, with close ties with the church, while at the same time coordinating the trade of people and prostitution in the Sepolia region. How much dirt? How much canoe? What can justice first of all?
 </p>
<p>
  From the first moment the case was unveiled and the crimes were revealed, the system did everything he could to cover the victims and kill the victims. The mother was in prison, her 12 -year -old and her brothers were threatened with their lives. Without any psychological, medical or financial support, she even deprived her of the right to come into contact with her mother.
  <b>
   State, police, judges, did what they could to convince all 12 years that they should not speak and report their rapists.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  The people are angry in the face of injustice and the concealment of the rotten. Similar fate had other cases of concealment of rich and high -ranking rapists and assassins. From the agriculture case in Thessaloniki to the mass crime of Tempi, the so -called "justice" presents the same consequence, serves the laws and those for whom they are written. The few and the powerful guaranteed rights and freedoms and whenever needed, mitigating and doubts are discovered. For the many, the poor, the oppressed, the law is relentless, a bite on his head.
 </p>
<p>
  The same "consistent" is the police, which conceals rape, inside and outside the police stations. It does not discriminate to rapists and not, it covers them all. And he is always at the forefront, ready to suppress any demonstration, concentration, strike. With the same consistency he chased and hit the demonstrators yesterday in Sepolia. The people who came out on the road to express their anger, fight for a fair decision and denouncing the concealment was confronted with MATs and Chemicals. This supports the attack on the people and their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The people are angry, not only today, not only because they do not tolerate a criminal and a basis like mich, but also for all the other suffering that has loaded him. Private universities, crime in Tempi, accuracy, disasters, war, auctions, terrorism, criminal code, fascism, afternoon surgeries, carinating, poverty….
 </p>
<p>
  This system has condemned us long before the crimes are committed. We will not let it acquit the culprits.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   Guilty to the capitalist system itself, governments, judges, repression bodies.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   We must also look consistent with the 12 -year -old, towards ourselves. To condemn Micho and all the culprits! To hope for a life with rights!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   All on the streets! The river is not turning back!
  </b>
</p>

    Professor G.N. Saibaba was not only the most famous political prisoner of India, but also organized the revolutionary democratic front (RDF) for a long time, whose general secretary he was. This organization defends the democratic and social rights of the Indian population and their interests against imperialism, as well as the revolutionary movement for a New Democratic revolution in India. The accusation of the Indian state is that the RDF would have a close connection to the so -called "Maoists". This was also the accusation of G.N. Saibaba and the reason for an originally pronounced lifelong imprisonment.

    In addition to the hollowing out neutrality, due to the approved NATO transport by Austria, the Austrian population had to endure this massive traffic obstacle on Monday evening. During the main traffic time (5:30 p.m. to around 7:15 p.m.), the entire A1 motorway was closed around the Salzburg city area. The extent exceeds a "normal" transport. This NATO trip was not a device transport, but tons of ammunition were transported! The risk was that the US military truck went into a residential area.

 they would have climbed but not able to overcome the inflation rate “Goldman 
 Sachs provides that the annual figure will drop from 4.6% to 3.9% in the first quarter 
 2024 and that the overall labor cost index will fall to 3.3% in the fourth 
 quarter."
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  While journalists express the 
 Usually cynicism: "
  <b>
   The latest numbers on salaries and profits are reassuring
  </b>
  ”, 
 they say. Of course, reassuring for the masters! And in fact they point out that “the 
 descent of inflation
  <b>
   It also makes requests for strong increases unlikely 
 wages
  </b>
  .”
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Salari are a fixed thought 
 of the masters and their agents: “The ECB president Christine Lagarde has indicated
  <b>
   The importance of data on employee wages
  </b>
  at the end of the 
 Board of Directors of 7 March. " And it could not be otherwise, given that i 
 wages are related to profits -
  <i>
   (On this we recommend reading Marx's text: "Salary price and profit")
  </i>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  These latter data, therefore, “damage 
 further tranquility on the

  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  This means that the cost of energy 
 (oil, gas etc.) increases, and also increases the cost of food, that is, yes 
 In fact, lower the purchasing power of the workers! Are the
  <b>
   others
  </b>
  goods, 
 therefore, that fall into price, and in fact Panetta, current governor of the 
 Bank of Italy says "that" to the stagnation of total production costs you do

   the weakness of the demand for goods and services

  …»
  <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  These data, therefore, also say 
 There is no growth that there is no growth:

   “In recent days the ECB has 
 Cut once again the growth estimates,

  further postponing the 
 resumption. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Also in Italy the masters have 
 made less loan requests
  <b>
   : “Credit is in contraction
  </b>
  , as 
 they showed the data on Italy yesterday. " But not only and not so much because the rates 
 of the ECB are high, but above all
  <b>

<p>
</p>
<p>
   Raised in a modest family, Antonio Díaz Martínez was an agronomist, anthropologist, rural sociologist and respected fighter of the Communist Party of Peru. Born in 1933 in the beautiful lands of Chota, province of the department of Cajamarca in Peru, it was the third of a family of seven children.
  </p>
<p>
   He studied at the National University of Trujill for the revolution in Peru during the 1970s and 1980s.
  </p>
<p>
   During those years he was able to work as a researcher on agricultural problems in the Inter -American Development Service (SCFI), which led him to work later at the Institute for Agrarian Reform and Colonization in the Apurimarac River section, which allows him to be in daily contact with the peasants of the Ayacuchana jungle.
  </p>
<p>
   Díaz Martínez began his revolutionary life in the 1960s being still a student of Sociology and interested in Marxist ideas, whose boom was at its maximum summit due to the international scene. In the year of 1964, Antonio met the comrade Abimael Guzmán who at that time was a professor at the National University of San Cristóbal de Huamanga, who convinced him to join the ranks of the newborn Communist Party of Peru (which would later be called equivocally As a light path), whose purpose was to develop the popular war in the country to conquer power and establish a popular republic as part of the world proletarian revolution.
  </p>
<p>
   In his revolutionary activity he met Catalina Adrianzen, - direction of the Popular Women's Movement (MFP) of Peru and PCP militant, in addition to the author of the text
   <em>
    Marxism, Mariátegui and the female movement
   </em>
   -, with which he married.
   <sup>
    1
   </sup>
</p>

   Due to its revolutionary commitment, its exorbitant knowledge of Peruvian socioeconomic conditions and especially for its inspiring rhetoric quickly was located as a militant with a lot of popularity within the party. It is here that he performed important intellectual tasks through the study of estates and peasant society exhibited in his book Ayacucho: hunger and hope, written in the year of 1969. The one that could be considered as his magna work, is divided into two parts: The first part describes the poor conditions in which the vast majority of the peasants of Ayacucho lived, a territory where Díaz Martínez performed his role as a party commander, and the second, performs a territorial analysis where he infers the possibilities of change in the region to through the armed revolution.
  </p>
<p>
   This book contributed to the study of the socio-economic conditions of the Peruvian field at that time, which allowed a theoretical characterization, laying the basis for the formulation of the development and germination plan of what was known as Ila-80 (beginning of the armed struggle , 1980) where the Ayacucho region was the place chosen by the PCP to turn on the spark that would initiate this fervent anti -imperialist, anti -capitalist and especially dignified fight, in command of the party and its top leader Abimael Guzmán. Revolutionary process that would extend from the countryside to the city coming to have fronts in the town center as happened in Lima.
  </p>
<p>
   In 1986, Antonio Diaz Martínez was arrested and accused of terrorism. Locked in Lima prison
   <em>
    Sixth
   </em>
   , and was later transferred to the Lurigancho Prison. He was the victim of extrajudicial murder in the mutiny of the prisoners of the Luminous Combat Trenches, which became known as the massacre of the prisons, which left a balance of 300 inmates murdered, who had given their lives to the revolution and the creation of a better world.
  </p>
<p>
   That is why, on his 90th birthday, and 37 years after he was executed by the barbarity of the Peruvian government, we remember a martyr who gave his life to the popular struggle, to the peasant struggle and to the dignity of a subjugated people. Comrade Antonio Díaz Martínez will always be present.

  Wednesday 13.3. A discussion was held in Helsinki under the title "What is proletarian feminism?".
 </p>
<p>
<span id="more-4989">
</span>
</p>
<p>
  There was a presentation on the subject, after which there was a lively discussion on the subject. The debate again showed that the troops are interested in proletarian feminism as opposite of bourgeois and small bourgeois feminism, which dominate public debate and the left.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the organizers, the mobilization of the troops to the event was successful, and they also consider the opportunity to be otherwise successful.

  This book that tells the path of a girl in Bagnoli's Italsider, as well as reading pleasantly, is interesting for at least two reasons, which contribute to the clarity of what the factory means and what it means to women.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  The emergence of class consciousness, the "worker" transformation, a worker who struggles, of Vincenzina - who is the daughter of an Italisider worker but had a completely different perspective than that of working in a factory that is scary, that you hate - does not happen easily, with contrasts, resistances, contradictions, but, then, above all, with the discovery of the hard factory.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  Vincenzina discovers that the factory - who killed the father, like many other workers - is also, and often above all, "community", collective, unity. This community is given by suffering, but is primarily given by the discovery of others, the others; A community that is not outside the factory, but that continues to live, above all, for workers even outside the factory.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  Exploitation, heavy, harmful working conditions, the fear of risking life like other workers/workers, the protervy of the leaders who care about human life, everything is there, especially in a steel factory such as Italsider; But there is gradually the discovery of strength, of the need to rebel, the joy of fighting, to unite, to be in a "family"; The reason for the pride of Vincenzina's father to be a communist.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  Then, all of this, the book describes it as it has lived by women, which is different. For workers, the effort is greater, because they have the weight of the family, the concerns that accompany them in the factory; concerns that they find every day outside, by the need, fear, suffering of aborting in then more terrible conditions, to sisters who delude themselves of an easy way to make money, from economic difficulties, to the subjects submissive, linked like a chain to their men, for better or for worse, etc. etc.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  But then, there is knowledge, the discovery of solidarity between women inside and outside the factory, friendships that become strong like steel. And therefore, the class community that is transformation, which gives strength, unity, hope. The factory in which to also find an unlawful, not false love.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  We conclude with
  <b>
   Vincenzina's words:
  </b>
<i>
   "... how many hells existed in addition to his. The devil never stopped spreading poison, poisoning, transforming lives and people. In the end,
   <b>
    Absurd, the factory saved.
   </b>
   At the beginning he had hated him because he had taken his father and had sucked in her too, while now
   <b>
    He realized that he had been on the wrong side of the world.
   </b>
   That place, 'or construction site, united people, made sure that everyone compact the other for dignity and nobility, so everyone became a single being, a
   <b>
    The only breath that sent life ahead ...
   </b>
   ".
  </i>
</div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
</div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  From a comment on Il Manifesto:
  <i>
   "... When the Italsider will close its doors in the autumn of 1990, a sense of profound melancholy invades the workers. The last day there is silence in the factory, there is little to say. Everything is empty and loss. Bagnoli is destined to become like a laceration of the social and historical fabric of Naples. Vincenzina pays the last coffee to her companions with the bitterness of a farewell, even if now she knows she is one of them, and it will be forever "
   <br>
   "...when

  Outside the police from Diaz ”, 
 This is the banner that appeared on Tuesday morning, and immediately removed, on 
 Cancelli of the Pertini Institute - Diaz in Genoa, the school where in 2001 
 The police beatings against the G8 demonstrators took place. To 
 hang it, students and students of the Institute to protest against 
 An initiative of work orientation with law enforcement agencies

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The work orientation initiative had been scheduled by teachers as part of the thirty hours of

  Students and students reiterated the 
 their clear opposition not only with the banner, but also through a 
 leaflets and its social pages. “A few days later 
 from the violent positions of the police against the students of Pisa, 
 Florence and Naples, we refuse that the police, right in a school like this

  From the feminismorivolumentation blog
 </p>
<p>
<span>
   This book that tells the path of a girl in Bagnoli's Italsider, as well as reading pleasantly, is interesting for at least two reasons, which contribute to the clarity of what the factory means and what it means to women.
  </span>
</p>
<div>
  The class awareness, the transformation "worker", a worker who struggle, of Vincenzina - who is the daughter of a worker of the Italian Ethialisider but had a completely different perspective compared to that of working in the factory that is frightening, which yes HATE - It happens not easily, with contrasts, resistances, contradictions, but, then, especially with the discovery of the hard factory.
 </div>
<div>
  Vincenzina discovers that the factory - who killed the father, like many other workers - is also, and often above all, "community", collective, unity. This community is given by suffering, but is primarily given by the discovery of others, the others; A community that is not outside the factory, but that continues to live, above all, for workers even outside the factory.
 </div>
<div>
  Exploitation, heavy, harmful working conditions, the fear of risking life like other workers/workers, the protervy of the leaders who care about life
  <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
  human, everything is there, especially in a steel factory like Italsider; But there is gradually the discovery of strength, of the need to rebel, the joy of fighting, to unite, to be in a "family"; The reason for the pride of Vincenzina's father to be a communist.
 </div>
<div>
  Then, all of this, the book describes it as it has lived by women, which is different. For workers, the effort is greater, because they have the weight of the family, the concerns that accompany them in the factory; concerns that they find every day outside, by the need, fear, suffering of aborting in then more terrible conditions, to sisters who delude themselves of an easy way to make money, from economic difficulties, to the subjects submissive, linked like a chain to their men, for better or for worse, etc. etc.
 </div>
<div>
  But then, there is knowledge, the discovery of solidarity between women inside and outside the factory, friendships that become strong like steel. And therefore, the class community that is transformation, which gives strength, unity, hope. The factory in which to also find an unlawful, not false love.
 </div>
<div>
  We conclude with
  <b>
   Vincenzina's words:
  </b>
<i>
   "... how many hells existed in addition to his. The devil never stopped spreading poison, poisoning, transforming lives and people. In the end,
   <b>
    Absurd, the factory saved.
   </b>
   At the beginning he had hated him because he had taken his father and had sucked in her too, while now
   <b>
    He realized that he had been on the wrong side of the world.
   </b>
   That place, 'or construction site, united people, made sure that everyone compact the other for dignity and nobility, so everyone became a single being, a
   <b>
    The only breath that sent life ahead ...
   </b>
   ".
  </i>
</div>
<div>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
</div>
<div>
  From a comment on Il Manifesto:
  <i>
   "... When the Italsider will close its doors in the autumn of 1990, a sense of profound melancholy invades the workers. The last day there is silence in the factory, there is little to say. Everything is empty and loss. Bagnoli is destined to become like a laceration of the social and historical fabric of Naples. Vincenzina pays the last coffee to her companions with the bitterness of a farewell, even if now she knows she is one of them, and it will be forever "
   <br>
   "...when

  The horrible massacre of workers continues uninterrupted. Yesterday another 5 
 deaths at work, 5 workers' lives, young people, elderly, migrants, 
 broke for the profit of the masters, for the system it produces 
 death of workers, for the government that on safety at work 
 It is fully demonstrated by being an agency, a consultancy office 
 of the masters.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It was not yet 
 off the echo and nor will the echo of the massacre of Florence be turned off, where 
 The workers were buried alive by the collapse of the certificates 
 to the construction of a new large shopping center 
 of Esselunga.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We already have 
 very said on this, reported, supported the protests on 
 territory, also supported the strike - banal and limited - 
 organized by the 2 -hour confederal unions. We denounced the 
 Government responsibility, the system, of the assassins.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But these new ones 
 Dead tells us that the complaint we do - just and necessary - 
 it is insufficient and that you have to go inside the events they produce 
 These dead workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Factory 
 First of all, because it is easy to describe working conditions 
 that there are in construction or are in the places where more easily 
 The life of the workers is at risk, but in the factory in general it is 
 hidden, it is less evident that the work is harmful, that the work is 
 fatal and that the profits of the masters are exactly the other face 
 of the planet of exploitation at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Caserta it is 
 Giuseppe Borrelli, 26 years old, a boy from Volla, in the 
 Neapolitan, crushed and dead in a press of the lamination 
 Thin, in the factory of the Moschini group that is based in San Marco 
 Evangelist, in the province of Caserta. It was alone when you are 
 verified the accident.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The group 
 Moschini is not a factories. The Moschini group has plants 
 In Italy, England, Turkey, Canada, South Korea. That of San Marco 
 It is not a factories, 400 workers work. Transform into 
 Aluminum films for food the profiles T 30/40 m. Borrelli 
 He worked there from three or
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 Four years, it's not even clear. But his 
 employer was not the Moschini group, for which he worked. The 
 Moschini Group was awarded by Mattarella, a few years ago, 
 of the honor of the Knights of Labor for special merits of the 
 Republic. The contract that Giuseppe Borrelli had with the GI 
 Group, an interim agency. It was the latter that had taken it 
 permanently and could move it from one customer to another 
 On the basis of the requests and it was Gi Group who paid him the salary 
 on the basis of the contractual settlement of metalworkers.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The figure of 
 This young worker is of staff leasing, that is, for rent, worker 
 for rent.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  To the company 
 this was very well because they had qualified personnel but, in the 
 at the same time, no direct contractual constraints with them.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  With the contract 
 Staff Leasing The worker feels perpetually in the balance, lives one 
 condition of eternal precariousness in each of the factories in which 
 Work. It is a young worker eternally blackmail and 
 therefore objectively available to accept business requests 
 of its use. If you are a leasing staff worker and you are considered a 
 Rompisciolele, the company takes you and respects you with the sender without 
 have no obligation to keep you at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Borrelli died 
 in the factory and there are other workers who carry out the same tasks 
 Yet the classification of these workers is different from 
 that of Joseph, because next to the time hires 
 indeterminate there are the precarious workers of the contracts of the contract, of 
 subcontracting and finally those provided by the inter -analysis agencies.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But yesterday another worker also died, a 38 -year -old worker, this time at 
 Jindal Films of Brindisi, the large industrial group 
 of the world steel that has disputed until the last 
 The acquisition of the ArcelMittal, the former Ilva. Later it has 
 was part of the Piombino steel, reducing it, too, 
 In an eternal layoffs waiting for better times. Daughter 
 by Jindal, the Vulcan Steel, is one of the possible buyers now 
 of the former Ilva of Taranto in the context of the new assignment to the new 
 master. So Jindal has other factories, minor plants, 
 not organically inserted in the steel plan. And one of these is 
 in the industrial area of Brindisi.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Gianfranco Conte, 
 38 years old, married and father of two children, died crushed by one 
 coil while working in the Jindal Films factory that it produces 
 Polyethylene movies, therefore a type of production different from 
 that of the steel. He was maneuvering a carroponte inside the 
 factory when it was overwhelmed by a coil, it was 
 centered in full chest. The impact was violent, remained for 
 a few minutes reactive, so much so that he himself turned off the switch 
 of the machine and asked for help. But gradually that the minutes 
 They flowed worse, he lost his senses. Upon arrival of the ambulance 
 The conditions were very serious. The impact with the coil caused 
 internal injuries. The race to the hospital was useless. AND 
 deceased a few minutes after arrival in the emergency room.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now there is 
 The investigation, but what is clearer than this death?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  At Jindal there 
 There was no security. Already on 27 August last year it was yes 
 Check another serious injury. And here it had been a worker of 
 Sixty years to risk life with a hand stuck in a roller. 
 Also there the worker had reacted, he had also had the blood here 
 cold to turn off the system switch. And here it had been 
 Saved, even if seriously injured.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So it is 
 evident that in this factory there is no security, there is never 
 was. And the workers, even in cases of accident, are alone. Yes 
 They must save life alone. Another worker also died 
 In Carpenedolo, Brescia. In Castellammare di Stabia, however, it is in the 
 Fincantieri who died a worker from Sri Lanka hit by a 
 illness. We still don't know much about this death.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But there are not 
 were only died in the factory yesterday. Often in a single day they die 
 More workers in multiple jobs. In San Giorgio a Liri 
 (Frosinone), a sixty year old fell from the compactor for the 
 separate collection and died.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What to do? 
 We have to listen to the litany of government/masters/press/unions 
 Confederali? We must once again wait for the strikes 
 immediate that in general are there, but that they immediately come 
 Forget?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 In this description of the dead there is already the reason for these 
 dead, circumstances can be random but it is 
 First of all of the question of contracts, cascade subcontracts, 
 These are the increasingly faster processes e 
 dangerous, it is the lack of control, it is 
 companies that may safely not take into account security, 
 Knowing that however nothing happens to him, they are situations 
 in which workers in the same conditions have different contracts e 
 So even that narrow self -control constraint is lacking 
 and solidarity. It is the absence of the union within the 
 factory, where the union line is always a collaborativeist with 
 masters and helpless to defend the conditions of the workers and the 
 workers do not see in the union a self -defense tool e 
 also a point of reference during their work and less than ever 
 A point of defense to prevent these situations from happening.
 </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   But it is clear that 
 until the structural conditions of precariousness are attacked, 
 the structural conditions of low wages, the structural conditions 
 reduction of safety costs and their impossibility of 
 be imposed through the legislative and criminal system that becomes 
 and less efficient in hitting these responsibilities.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The choice of 
 government is that of collaboration with the masters, is that of 
 Protection of the masters. And evident that this means deaths on 
 Work.

<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All the press these days speaks of Leonardo and his own 
 revenues, its development and above all the fact that Leonardo does 
 preparing to become European leader, even in the market also 
 world, as regards the production of armaments.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start from 
 data, because they are clear, explanatory of what politics is 
 of Leonardo and the policy of the Italian State, within the 
 International situation regarding wars 
 imperialist.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The data that 
 They come out of Leonardo speak of large revenues: in 2023 there 
 There were 15.29 billion, orders for 17.9 billion, doubled 
 the dividend for € 0.28 per share and, above all, for 
 Exercise 2024 is mentioned of growing revenues up to 16.8 billion, 
 Growth orders and growing cash flow etc. etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is also said 
 Where, in fact, Leonardo is strengthening and this 
 strengthening takes place in Puglia, especially where there are 105 orders 
 billions and revenues for 95 billion. There is a plan that goes until 2028 
 in
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 to which Leonardo aims to grow the three divisions in Puglia, 
 The golden aerostructures between Grottaglie and Foggia, helicopters in Brindisi 
 and above all electronic defense in Taranto.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So - and not it 
 hide - the defense is what is the clearest perception 
 of the change taking place in this historical phase. In these sectors the 
 Leonardo wants to become a European leader, strengthen the core 
 defense electronics business, helicopters and aircraft of which yes 
 He says there is a strong recovery of the market and, of course, there is no 
 This strong recovery is surprising given the active participation 
 military of Italy in the interimperialist war in progress now by 
 More than two years in Ukraine, given her support in the Middle East, 
 in particular to the state of Israel, given its presence more 
 Recent in the Red Sea.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So the 
 Leonardo direction of travel is to be an actor 
 key in the military sector, “increasing the transformation 
 orders in revenues and enhancing the development of products for 
 reach this position of leader ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How long 
 It concerns the defense electronics on Taranto La Leonardo works 
 Much with the Navy. Recall that from the naval base of 
 Taranto, one of the greatest naval bases, co -team 
 From Italian imperialism and NATO, military missions start 
 for war interventions.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time, Leonardo, is said, is not limited only to the European sphere, 
 being now an integrated multinational to US companies. So 
 It is clear what this situation means: that is confirmed 
 which was briefly said by John Reed in the “10 days that 
 they upset the world ", that wars mean profits for the 
 companies, profits for capital, death and destruction for 
 populations, for proletarians, for people, women, children.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Therefore we 
 We have those who produce these war equipment here, these 
 death equipment and on these it does its revenues and on these 
 Above all, it aims to expand.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fact there is 
 The other aspect, the allies that Leonardo is looking for and in 
 The alliance with Iveco Defense is particular. Here the goal of 
 Leonardo is to expand his presence in the industry of 
 earthly armaments, given that the Iveco Defgence is said to participate 
 to a consortium with the company Leonardo Oto Melara for production 
 of armored and armored vehicles.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This kind of 
 production is not hidden but you also want to embellish it, both 
 highlighting the other commitments that Leonardo is making 
 on the level of safety, of the environment.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But "security" 
 what does it mean?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We know that 
 When it comes to "security", also for citizens, with this 
 State, with this government, as they say, you have to “put your hand to 
 pistol".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As 
 it concerns the environment, as regards employment - there will be a 
 increase in employment and a transformation especially in 
 Puglia of fixed -term hires in stable and definitive hires. 
 And here is added the icing on the cake which compared to these 
 hiring there will also be a strengthening of the female contribution 
 in the company in terms of insertions and presence of women in the 
 leadership positions and compared to 30% more on the total of 
 employees.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it seems - how 
 It is said - to make the spirit to a funeral: while producing 
 Death equipment we talk about safeguarding the climate, we speak 
 of environmentalization.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But from everything 
 This emerges how right and necessary what is often is necessary 
 taking place also in various initiatives, in events for the 
 Palestine, that is, to report, attack, make the principals 
 against Leonardo, because it is the most emblematic reality of this 
 Active complicity of the Italian government, of the imperialist state 
 Italian, to the wars that affect peoples and destroy, 
 They carry on the genocides as in Palestine.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This complaint, 
 These struggle principals must continue.

  On March 7, the Red Women's Committee, as part of the Info Café captured in the international center B5, carried out an event on the occasion of the International Frauenkampft Day. Proletarian feminism was explained, about the origin of the oppression of the woman, as well as some aspects of the legal situation of women in the FRG.

  We have received information that anti -imperialist collective in Copenhagen will mark on March 18 - International Solidarity Day with political prisoners - in the people's café. The comrades therefore write about the event:
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
<em>
   Come to anti -imperialist Monday night in the people's café. Here we mark on March 18, which is the International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Come and mark the day with us and show your solidarity with revolutionary fighters and catches all over the world, like those in Palestine and the People's Wars in Peru, Turkey, India and the Philippines. This year, we would like to particularly highlight Georges Ibrahim Abdallah's struggle as well as a battle that is not particularly elucidated in Denmark yet: namely the fight against imperialist mega projects in Mexico such as the Interocean Corridor (CIIT) that destroys local communities and poor farmers and native life in the name of profits . The old Mexican state, in leading with local reactionary landlords' death patrols, terrorizes the people of the state of Oaxaca in Mexico. Many struggle to defend the rights of the people such as Corrient Del Pueblo - Sol Rojo and other people's fighters and many have sacrificed their lives and freedom for the matter.
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
<em>
   Dr. Ernesto Sernas Garcia, a popular lawyer, has been disappeared by the Mexican state for up to several years now because he has actively fought for and got many people's fighters acquitted in litigation. His disappearance is therefore undoubtedly politically motivated because his work directly challenges the interests of the imperialists and the Mexican reaction.
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
<em>
   Come and have a talk, a cheap cup of coffee or tea, and learn about the political situation and the fight against imperialism in Mexico and the rest of the world, as well as the campaign for Dr. Ernesto Sernas Garcia.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
    Freedom of all political prisoners!
   </strong>

<p>
  The country's inflation grew again and recorded a 0.83% increase in February. In it, seven of the nine groups measured by IBGE's National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) recorded discharge. In January, the IPCA had closed at 0.42%. The numbers are worrying for the government, which had bad results in assessments of the economy and high prices in research recently released by Quaest. The new results, especially if they endure, can contribute to the government's popular disapproval rate to grow.
 </p>
<p>
  Many of the groups that were discharged are part of the daily life of the most basic accounts of the people. They are food and beverages (0.95%), transportation (0.72%), housing (0.27%), communication (1.56%) and education (4.89%). In addition, there were high health and personal care groups (0.65%), personal expenses (0.05%).
 </p>
<p>
  In education, it is likely that the increase has been moved by discharge in the costs of tuition fees of regular courses of all tracks. High high school (8.51%), elementary school (8.24%), preschool (8.51%), day care (6.03%), technical course 96.14%) had high school (8.24%), 96.14%), Higher education (3.81%) and postgraduate (2.76%).
 </p>
<p>
  In transport, all fuels increased, in addition to transport rates such as taxi (0.64%) and buses (1.91%). Ethanol rose 4.52%, 0.22%vehicle gas, 0.14%diesel oil and gasoline 2.93%. At the beginning of the year, several cities recorded protests against the increase in the price of tickets, such as

  (PR).
 </p>
<p>
  Already in food, the increase was also felt by the people in a general way. The most basic items, such as onion (7.37%), potatoes (6.79%), fruits (3.74%), rice (3.69%) and long life milk (3, 3, were high 49%).

  Another research, conducted by the Dieese, revealed that of the 17 capitals where the department conducts the national survey of the basic food basket, 14 recorded an increase in basic foods. In cities such as Rio de Janeiro, the increase even beaten 5.18%.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Bad omen to the government
 </h4>
<p>
  There are terrible news for the government of Luiz Inacio, which was recently poorly evaluated by the people in research conducted by institutes such as Atlas Intel and Quaest.
 </p>
<p>
  In the results released by Atlas Intel, 53% consider that the economy goes ill, while 49% find the same in January. Already in the Queest survey, 73% of respondents realized that prices increased. That is, they felt the impact of inflation on personal economies.
 </p>
<p>
  The data are still contrasting to those celebrated by the government when it comes to both the “discharge of GDP” or “trade balance record”. Nevertheless, the discrepancy is not surprising, as it is well known that an increase in GDP does not mean improvement in the living conditions of the people, especially when the increase is pulled by a branch as far from the nation's interests as agribusiness. Products cultivated in the estate are intended for export, and do not lower the price of food internally. Profits are absorbed by landowners, not reversed to the country. And taxes are relieved through billionaire exemptions.
 </p>
<p>
  What the people feel, therefore, is the real economy. And this is far from doing well. It is a bad omen to the government, which tends to see the rates of disapproval grow as the people realize, little by little, that the distant campaign promises, which were no longer there, but the basics, remain distant. Thus it is also realized that the way to guarantee and achieve basic rights is not that I await the promises of the government, but another: to break the strings and to fight, as independent and combatively political force.

   This morning the interrogation of a guarantee of Anan Yaeesh in the district house of Terni took place. The accusatory prospect accepted by the investigating judge of the L'Aquila court is relating to the organization of a terrorist group called "Tulkarem Brigade", operating in the city of Tulkarem in the West Bank, budding of the brigades of the Martyrs of Al-Aqsa.

<br>
</br></span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   Anan has released a long and articulated spontaneous declaration by pronouncing a j’ accusa against the exquisitely political character of the investigation. In particular, he told the condition of oppression and violence suffered by the Palestinian people subjected to the Israeli military yoke in the indifference of the
   <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
   international community. He told his story as a young Palestinian, the killing of his girlfriend by the Israeli army as they went to school, the dirty hands of the girl's blood, the attempted murder of which he was the victim in 2006 by Israeli soldiers, The 11 shots of firearm from which he was reached, the horror tried by the mother to the sight of his injury and the consequent stroke from which he was reached by losing forever the cognitive skills, his friends killed by the army.

<span style="font-family: verdana;">
<br>
</br></span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   He claimed to refuse the stigma of the terrorist for himself and for his people, he recalled that all peoples have the right to fight for their freedom against the invading army, compared the Palestinian struggle to that of Italy during resistance, And he stressed that, rather, no western country has ever grown in supporting Ukraine, which has also been armed by the same West. He recalled the horror of the Gaza war and the 30 thousand Palestinian dead of which over two thirds and children, and rhetorically asked who the terrorists are.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
<br/>
</span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   He also recalled that the struggle for Palestine is played in the occupied territories and not elsewhere, referring to this to the articles of newspapers that feared the danger of acts of violence in Italy. He concluded by saying that he only wants peace and freedom for their people.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  Last Wednesday, March 13, hundreds of workers from the Bahia State and Municipal Network made a series of protests and stirred the Bahia Administrative Center (CAB) demanding the payment of the National Professional Salary Floor (PSPN), appreciation of the education professionals, better working conditions, public tender and the revocation of Ordinance No. 190/2024,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/ba-com-a-portaria-da-aprovacao-em-massa-governo-da-bahia-busca-maquiar-crise-na-educacao-da-rede-estadual/">
   called the “mass approval ordinance”
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The teachers performed three acts that started around 9 am at the Municipal Court of Auditors (TCM), traveling the interior of CAB to the State Department of Education (SEC) and ended with an act in front of the union of municipalities from Bahia (UPB). The protests brought together teachers from more than 250 municipalities in the state who denounced working conditions in schools through bands and posters that required:
  <strong>
   Climatization, now!
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Call, now!
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Compliance with the floor now!
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The protests held on 13/03 were preceded by a series of mobilizations of the teachers of the Municipal Network of Salvador. In a “state of strike” since 03/05, the professionals of municipal education, on the morning of 03/07, paralyzed the activities and protested in front of the Municipal Education Secretariat (SMED). On the 12th of the same month the workers will cross their arms again and protest in the center of Salvador, traveling from Campo Grande to City Hall. Throughout this journey of struggle, the workers raised their consigns for paying the salary floor and better working conditions.
 </p>
<p>
  The mobilizations occurred in the scenario of deepening the scrapping of education that reflects the lag of the payment of teachers' salary. It is in this reality that the teachers of the municipality of Salvador have been bittering for 12 years without the municipal executive to comply with the national salary floor (R $ 4,580.57), resulting in a loss of 60.99% in relation to the current maturity floor Professionals (R $ 2,845.26).
 </p>
<p>
  The correspondent of the and was present at the demonstration of the 13th, performing the coverage and reaping reports of the educators.
 </p>
<p>
  A worker from the Salvador municipal network denounced the precariousness of classroom conditions that have large amounts of students in small spaces and inadequate ventilation. The educator also continues to denounce the lack of appreciation that face educators:
 </p>
<p>
  "Is very difficult. It is the only profession that forms all professions, suffers so much and has no recognition for the management that is there. It is very sad today to be a teacher in the municipality of Salvador, ”said the educator.
 </p>
<p>
  He also denounced the lack of speed in the health insurance that forces many professionals to seek other plans or even abdicate the care of their own health.
 </p>
<p>
  In the state network, the situation is no different.
 </p>
<p>
  "The heat is unbearable. Even the rooms that have a fan, do not solve because the heat is strong. There are air-conditioned rooms, but it is broken. No one is holding on, ”said a state network educator.

  In an admirable effort to recover memory in the state of Paraná, three academics from the areas of archeology, anthropology and ethnology of federal universities in the southern southeast of Brazil have just unveiled the mystery of the true authorship of a curious set of mini-sculptures in wax of Bee stored for over 80 years at the Parana Museum (Mupa) in Curitiba.
 </p>
<p>
  The small pieces, which were erroneously attributed to a “cabocla” origin, were made in reality, discovered the 3 teachers by an ancient indigenous leader of the Paraná Kaingangues named Vitorino Pinheiro (Yogon, in his language), which was from Faxinal Village) , in the today Municipality of Cândido de Abreu, central region of the state.
 </p>
<p>
  The 12 small works of art, made with bee wax mixed with charcoal and animal fat, portraying cattle and humans in a moving tropter scene, according to the academics were presented by Vitorino in 1948 Wanda Hanke, a brave Austrian-Hungarian doctor , friend of Indians from various “lost” tribes in the southern interior, who visited and studied them in the 1930s/40, without asking bureaucratic orders to the government.
 </p>
<p>
  The result of studies of
  <em>
   Cláudia Parellada
  </em>
  (UFPR/MUPA),
  <em>
   Felipe Vander Velden
  </em>
  (UFSCar SP) and
  <em>
   Josiéli SPENASSATTO
  </em>
  (UFPR/MUPA) It was published a few weeks ago in the report
  <strong>
<em>
    The Vitorino Wax Troop: the Kanhgág in Paraná on the horse and oxen routes.
   </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
  (Note: The “kanhgág” form is the one employed by the tribe itself.)
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Encounters with the invaders
 </h4>
<p>
  Next we present a summary of the text, adapted journalistically.
 </p>
<p>
  “Deepened research allowed not only to reclassify the set (wax pieces) in the mupa, but also to complexify the understanding, from the micro-agreement of its production and collecting, to the macro-agreement of its insertion within the relationship between the Kanhgág in PR and the non -indigenous invading their territories. ”
 </p>
<p>
  “Our focus is especially on what these materials tell us about Kanhgág interactions with the domesticated animals introduced (by invaders) and artifacts linked to the world of farms (shotgun, harness, bows, hats). With this, we explored the narratives of the meetings between indigenous and non -indigenous (…), highlighting aspects still little discussed from the history of interethnic relations in Brazil. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Computer, digital magnifying glass and taquara stem
 </h4>
<p>
  "The raw materials were characterized through binocular and digital computers coupled to the computer and by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) at the Federal Police Superintendence Laboratory in Curitiba."
 </p>
<p>
  “In the description with the help of the magnifying glasses, the coal was observed in the eyes that, by the characteristics detected, is compatible with the taquara stem, which can also be used as a raw material of baskets by the Kanhgág. Taquara thin spatulas seem to have collaborated in the making of sculptures. ”
 </p>
<p>
  “It was also found that, due to the physicochemical characteristics of the raw materials, sculptures are very fragile, which imposes a problem for their conservation, manipulation and investigation. Climate stability is recommended, with a maximum temperature of 21 degrees and maximum humidity of 60%, as well as protection with packaging
  <em>
   Etaphoan,
  </em>
  and avoid, as much as possible, the mobility of the pieces. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Returning Earth and Language
 </h4>
<p>
  Indigenous peoples today add in Paraná around 30,000 self -declared people, of which about 70% are Kaingangues, that is, something like 21,000. In Brazil it is one of the most populous ethnicities, although it is restricted to PR, SC, RS and SP.
 </p>
<p>
  Your language belongs to the Jê group, with dialects. There was a low in idioms until the 1988 Constitution, when it was valued again with the claim for resumption of its lands. In the 1500s they owned a vast territory in the South Southeast, which suffered continuous invasions.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The horse will defecate here
 </h4>
<p>
  "Vitorinian sculptures can be analyzed in the light of Kanhgág's relationships with the large domesticated mammals of foreign origin," the 3 academics report.
 </p>
<p>
  “For although they were part of Faxinal's life in the 1940s, and the experience with animals introduced with the conquest have the Kanhgág in PR in a long time, one must pay attention so that their incorporation has not been made without resistance, or critical appreciation. Gog's testimony about what his grandfather said (collected by K.Tommasino at P. Indigenous Apucarana) is illustrative of this: 'The horses will defecate here on your land', he always said that. Tommsino continues to comment on the relationship that the Kanhgág do ‘between the arrival of whites with horses, alien animals, in a clear allusion to the invasion. (…). The horse here is a metaphor of the world
  <strong>
   announced
  </strong>
  [whites] as opposed to humans and native animals. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Addicted to the Indian's taste
 </h4>
<p>
  “Marta Amoroso (1998) demonstrated how, in the nineteenth -century capuchin villages in the PR, the expeditioners of the Empire and the religious identified‘ on the palate the gateway to the Kaingang, Kaiowá and Guarani Christian civilization that circulated in the region. In the 1840s, the Baron of Antonina sent to the Government of S.Paulo its plan for the reduction of the Kaiowá, which points to the guideline of
 </p>
<p>
  ‘(…) Create among the Indians the needs of civilized man, making them easier for them the necessary means.
 </p>
<p>
  Early on-the Baron will say-it would be necessary to teach them how to raise pigs, birds and even give them some cattle. It would be, after being used to it, impossible to return to wandering life. '
 </p>
<p>
  “The same author enables us to see how the modification of the taste was in the process of civilization defended by the authorities. New taste ': salt, sugar, brandy, smoke and meat of domestic animals such as cattle and pork. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The Bonfire of Beds
 </h4>
<p>
  “Decades later, in the 1930s, (anthropologist) Claude Lévi-Strauss was in the northern region of PR where these same villages later analyzed by Amoroso endured. He visited the indigenous village S. Jerome, and noted that the government had struggled to integrate indigenous residents in Western modernity. (…) But the assimilationist interests were unsuccessful as expected and were abandoned, among them, the forced introduction of livestock.
 </p>
<p>
  From their ephemeral civilization experience, the Indians only kept the Brazilian clothes, the ax, the knife and the sewing needle. In everything else, it was the failure. They had built houses, and they slept in the open. They sought to fix them in the villages and remained nomads. As for the beds, they burned them to fire and slept on the floor. The herds of cows sent by the government wandered randomly, for the indigenous people disgusted their meat and milk. ”

  The 6th anniversary of the abominable political attack of the then councilwoman Marielle Franco, in central city, in the neighborhood of Estácio. Rio de Janeiro lived, in March 14, 2018, in full military intervention, with General Walter Braga Neto and the Military Command of the East Reactionary Army assuming the full command of the entire police-military structure of the state, while Brazil In the end, the far-right Bolsanista scaled its performance through reactionary violence to establish a situation of social chaos and such a commotion that they convinced the high-forced officials to do such “military intervention”.
 </p>
<p>
  As this podium has already stated,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/editorial-semanal-extrema-direita-bolsonarista-mandou-matar-marielle/">
   “There are all theses that seek to give circumstantial responses or centered on the figure of the councilwoman, as the one who advocates that death had been ordered because Marielle would have been a 'stone in the shoe' of the paramilitarians. No, none of these theses are sustained ”
  </a>
  . If there may be circumstantial convergences of interests, the truth is that Marielle was killed in the Esteio and trail of the scammer climbing promoted by the far right, on a national scale.
 </p>
<p>
  By denunciations, it is already known that Élcio Queiroz, former military policeman, was the driver of the car who chased the former councilor, while Ronnie Lessa, also former military policeman, was the executioner of the attack. We also know that in the New Year of 2017, Ronnie Lessa sought Elcio, stating that she would make the attack, including saying that she had already tried unsuccessfully that same year. Ronnie and Élcio also mobilized Maxwel Simões Corrêa and Edilson Barbosa dos Santos to surveillance Marielle's routine and the disappearance of the car that would be used in the operation. Finally, we know that Ronnie Lessa was not the creator of the operation: Marielle's executor does not even know who is the mastermind, as everything was brokered by former military policeman Edmilson Oliveira da Silva (Macalé), who was due in an ambush, in 2021.
 </p>
<p>
  The investigations themselves seek, in an interpersonal relationship, the motivation for the attack. And fail. Anyone who is the principal, just a whole vision can correctly interpret the facts. Let's make a regression again,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/editorial-semanal-extrema-direita-bolsonarista-mandou-matar-marielle/">
   that this tribune has done at other times
  </a>
<p p="">
<p>
    There will be no real clarification of the crime if there is no real investigation of these broader relationships. Marielle was the victim of the old democracy who, unable to placate the coup that germinates since her gut, produced her own pockets and breastfeeding the far right with decades of appeasement and conciliation. In addition to a victim of pockets, Marielle was the victim of her own illusions with "democracy."

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The question of affordable and good living space for the mass of the people is an increasingly urgent question in almost every federal state. And also in North Rhine-Westphalia, the current economic crisis and its political handling, disastrous for the mass of people, find its special expression in the shortage of housing.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  CDU building minister Ina Scharrenbach blames high interest and construction costs as well as worries about crisis. That with this reasoning only half the truth was said
  <a href="https://rotepresse.noblogs.org/files/2023/08/2023-66-juli.pdf">
   T was treated in the Red Post last year.
  </a>
  At that time it was summarized that the rent increases in North Rhine -Westphalia increased more in 2023 than rents together in the past ten years before.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For Scharrenbach, the basic problem is that there is not enough apartments and therefore no longer available apartments on the market. This is either not enough for people with lower incomes or that much is built, the supply and demand will be balanced and that the real estate monopolists could not simply choose richer tenants. That would at least be the possible derivations from the "building" argument.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But this reasoning is the finest demagogy. And you can see that especially in practice, because Scharrenbach has now written a guideline that creates relief in the crisis, for the real estate monopolies. Because there are obviously missing many and affordable apartments in North Rhine -Westphalia, real estate companies which are to build new social housing with government funding should be able to set up the rent of these newly built social housing disproportionately in the future.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In summary, this means that the black and green state government in NRW promises to solve the housing shortage through the construction of social housing and gives real estate companies capital funding to build these social housing. However, in order to make the company really tasty and to stabilize the German monopolies in times of crisis and maintain their marking and competitive, the companies may still take a rent that no longer corresponds to the standards of a social housing. In the end, the bourgeois state is making a lot of money built up with apartments that will be too expensive for many workers again so that the monopolies can enrich themselves.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/landespolitik/land-erhoeht-sozialmieten-neubauten-100.html">
   The WDR has calculated what this means.
  </a>
  In cities such as Münster, Düsseldorf or Cologne, workers with around 1700 euros monthly net income per square meter more have to spend more than rent. With a 60 square meter apartment, that would then be 45 euros that would come to the rent. It costs even more for workers who earn more than 1700 euros net, which Scharrenbach justifies that they are not the primary group of those entitled to the apartment. The minister, firstly, does not make a distinction between a single and family household and also does not consider 2000 euros net with the inflations of the living costs of the past few years, especially if you still have a family for whom you have to take care.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This impoverishment directive is not surprising by the tenant association in NRW. While the Association of the Scharrenbach housing and real estate industry praised for increasing the "social rent", since they could not work without economics and Minister Scharrenbach tries to keep out that one can be happy about the proportionality of the increase in the first design by the monopolies -probably higher. We see that we can and cannot expect anything from the bourgeoisie - in that case the real estate monopolies - and their politicians. As for the solution, you think of the song line of the poem of the "Resolution of the municipalities" by Bertolt Brecht with so much undisguised fraud:
  <br>
<em>
</em>
</br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<em>
   "In consideration that there are houses while you leave us without staying
  </em>
<br>
<em>
   We decided to move in there now because it no longer fits us in our holes.
  </em>
<br>
<em>
   (…)
  </em>
<br>
<em>
   In consideration that we do not trust the government of whatever it also promises
  </em>
<br/>
<em>
   We decided to build a good life under Eigen's leadership. "
  </em>

   Modena: the carabinieri kick and punched a man
  </br></span>
</b>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  In Modena, a carabinieri patrol kicks and punches a man who opposes arrest ... punches and slaps in the face and on the neck, repeated affected on the hips ...
 </p>
<p>
  It all started in a public garden, a few steps from the Starchi Theater, the main place of shows in the city. Two carabinieri of the local lieutenant are proceeding with the detention of a man without documents who has resisted to avoid being brought to the barracks. The highest of the two soldiers in uniform holds him by the right arm while the colleague grabs him for the left one. Then he hits the suspect for a first time with force,
  <b>
   launching a fist in the face. Several other punches to the kidneys follow, and then back in the face.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  The man wags. He speaks, he seems to turn to someone in the surroundings, perhaps asking for help. The carabinieri

 They push him to make him sit on the back of the gazelle, but he grabs one of the military for the lake, and these - the same who beat him previously - resumes a

  hit it again in the head and back.
 </b>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Accused of resisting a public officer and damaging the service car, the man then appeared in court, where the judge validated the measure and released him.
 </p>
<p>
  “They fierce with unnecessary violence. - says the lawyer of the boy Barbara Bettelli - If a person opposes a legitimate control, it must be contained, not beaten ". The young man's lawyer, regular and with a job as a help-one in a restaurant in the province, will evaluate whether to protrude lawsuit.
 </p>
<p>
  The young man - according to his lawyer - reported to the judge that he was at the bus stop to go to work when he was checked. He did not have the documents with him and would have told the military, reports his lawyer, which he could have called a friend that he would bring them to him. At that point, however, he would have been invited to get into the car to go to the barracks and he didn't want to. “At the hearing it was said that it was controlled because it seemed suspicious. But in my opinion there was no clues that was committing a crime ", explains the lawyer. It is a boy who arrived in Italy a few years ago "in the boat" and "there are no precedents of convictions". After making the dishwasher, he currently works as a chef's help in a restaurant in the province "and is highly appreciated by his owner". The hearing was postponed to April 18.
 </p>
<p>
  The two military of the weapon were temporarily reused in other positions and the video is being examined by the Modena prosecutor for the possible opening of a file.

  About the book
 </h4>
<p>
  How to resist in the face of a hard combat? How to overcome jail? How to raise the revolutionary flag at the darkest moments? These questions that are commonly raised by true Democrats, when dealing with one of the bloodiest periods in our history, are answered through the great example of Alipio de Freitas.
 </p>
<p>
  The revolutionary trajectory of Alípio de Freitas, a tireless militant in the cause of the liberation of the peoples, and his resistance in the prisons of the military-fascist regime in Brazil are recorded in Resisting is Necessary, a book of his work that had its first edition published in 1981.
 </p>
<p>
  Alipio played a highlighted role in the direction of the peasant alloys in the 1960s, performing the task of political instructor, occupying the general secretary of his organization. After the 1964 military-fascist coup, he moves to clandestinity, and is fully dedicated to the revolutionary peasant struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  Persecuted, he exiled in Mexico and then headed to Cuba, where he held courses in political and military formation and prepared his return to Brazil to continue the revolutionary struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  In 1970 he is arrested by the green-fashionwater regime. It spends almost ten years imprisoned in different arrests, facing and resisting the most brutal torture. Without ever folding, he defeated his tormentors. His memories of resistance in jails were recorded alive in the book “Resist is Precise”.
 </p>
<p>
  His memory and legacy, in turn, continue to be honored by those who now wield his flag. As highlighted by the National Commission of the Leagues of Poor Peasants (LCP), in a message to Guadalupe Magalhães, tireless and inseparable companion of Alípio de Freitas: "We will always honor our Honorary President, raise his name, fulfill the dream for which he fought so hard."

   Today, Thursday 14/3 there was a demonstration in the city center against Pierrakakis.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: large;">
   Student clubs, the racing moves, the SSP, the student course and the space were involved with block.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: large;">
   Despite the picture of removing the last week's collective processes at universities, students continue to be on the road. This shows that the educational rallies that have long been established every Thursday and the fight against (now voted) Pierrakakis law must continue.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: large;">
   With banners and slogans, racing moves highlighted this very necessity of continuing the struggle in the direction of overthrowing the law, against the compromise set by the reformist left about the non -implementation/blockage of the law.

<br>
 Lenin states that the most essential need for the working class is political knowledge and political education.
 <br>
<br>
 "Everyone agrees that it is necessary to develop the political knowledge of the working class, but how is it necessary to do this? The economic struggle compels the workers to pose only the problems which concern the relations between the government and the working class, and therefore, no matter how much effort we make to "give the economic struggle itself a political character," we can never, within these limits, develop the political consciousness of the workers to the level of Social-Democratic political consciousness, because the limits are too narrow."
 <br/>
<br/>
 This is truly an important thing in general and here and today, in the effort that we communists do to develop political consciousness and, consequently, the political organization of the workers. Instead, first of all our companions and in general the workers or militant companions who are persisting on
 <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
 Doing, marching and operating in a obstinate direction and contrary to the address of the vision that Lenin teaches us, that is, to remain within the too narrow limits of the economic struggle.
 <br/>
<br/>
 "The capital error of all economists: the belief that the political consciousness of the workers from the inside can be developed so to speak of their economic struggle. That is, starting only, or at least above all, from this struggle. This conception is radically Wrong ... and it happens so that we do not literally understand each other and we talk two different languages ".
 <br/>
<br/>
 And that's exactly what happens in our communist organization and even more in our relationship between communists and workers' avant -garde.
 <br/>
<br/>
 "The political consciousness of class can be brought to the worker only from the outside, that is, from the outside of the economic struggle, from the outside of the sphere of the relationship between the worker and the master. The field from which only it is possible to draw this knowledge is the field of the relationships between all classes and strata and the state and the government, the field of mutual relations between all classes ". Therefore to the question to do to bring political knowledge to the workers, the economist replies limiting himself to the intervention in the economic struggle, to speak to the workers of the issues that "interest workers", when - Lenin insists "to bring political knowledge to the workers I Social Democrats must go among all the classes of the population, in all directions the drappes of their army must send in all directions ".
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the context of the present situation, in which the forces are limited, the militants are few, it is evident that this means in practice bringing to the workers the general political situation, the situation of all classes of the population, the situation of the movements that develop within it. That is, to use the weapon of propaganda and agitation that translates into workers' knowledge of what is really happening and to feed it into class political consciousness.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Lenin, therefore, takes into consideration the real activity of what he calls "social-democratic circles" and which today must be understood as the activity of communists organized in the various social realities of our country, and in particular those who actually operate, today very few, towards the working class, to which we would add today, because they are the most widespread, who operate in general among the workers.

   The New Democracy
  </strong>
  , the Political Act "Neither forget, nor appease: condemn the military coup yesterday and today", which will take place on April 25, in Rio de Janeiro, has confirmed attendances and a book is expected to be launched.
 </p>
<p>
  The political act, which will take place in a place traditionally used by the progressive forces of Rio de Janeiro (to be confirmed), will take the form of a table and interventions of notorious characters, such as progressive intellectuals, journalists and democratic press vehicles, family members of victims of victims of repression during the fascist military regime and other political forces.

  , retired judge, member of the Association of Judges for Democracy (AJD), of the Brazilian Center for Solidarity with Peoples (Cebraspo) and of the Editorial Board of the
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  . The purpose of the act is to remark once again the rejection and condemnation of the coup, whether it is the one consummated in 1964, or the one that now gains freely in the barracks and in society; as well as demarcating with conciliation and appeasement that only feed the coup plotters.

  No manifesto do ato, or
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  It states: "It is urgent that we undertake serious combat of coup, condemning the 60 years of the military coup of 1964 and the coup still today." “Those events are not a
  <em>
   trauma
  </em>
  to be forgotten. Want to forget it, as the President of the Republic Luiz Inácio and the ultra-rightist General Hamilton Mourão, obviously competes for his repetition. After all, it is not a healing wound: as January 8 has shown, the wound is still open and without proper treatment. Even today, as much as in the 1960s, the weeds of coup are growing through all the halls and surroundings of meetings in the barracks. ”
 </p>
<p>
  The text also points out that "the same policy of vigorous appeasement has been repeated since 1988, the genuine democrats, progressive and revolutionaries will hire a new military crisis, which rests on an irresolved base, will be more serious and dangerous."

<p>
  “As part of combating the policy of appeasement (only a way of cowing),
  <strong>
   We demand that the special committee on the dead and missing politicians be reinstated
  </strong>
  by the government of shift, because it is a demand felt from family members and of unique importance to bring to the national political debate the fascist horrors of the military regime. It is necessary to defend the democratic freedoms, already so much and under permanent attacks, through the urgent mobilization, ”adds the manifesto.

  Blacksmith Kawa’s act of rebellion against Dehaq is the acknowledging of all enslaving chains. Blacksmith Kawa’s rebellion against the cruel Dehaq is not only an assertion of righteousness, but also an expression of historical consciousness that represents the truth. What gave the spirit of Newroz, which is a part of the thousands of years of history of the struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed, and its symbol, the fire, was the justice and righteousness of the oppressed against the oppressors. Newroz is a fire of rebellion for those who are right.
 </p>
<p>
  Newroz is an act of awakening, resurrection, and awareness of one’s chains. Undoubtedly, Newroz is a celebration for those who were tried to be enslaved, assimilated, whose culture was destroyed and whose language was banned by the Turkish rulers due to their national identity. It is a struggle for awakening, resistance and liberation from all these oppressions of the Kurdish nation, which is tried to be kept under national oppression. This struggle for liberation was tried to be suppressed by the Fascist dictatorship with massacres, destruction, bans and denials. Newroz was banned by Fascism as also being a Kurd is banned.
 </p>
<p>
  However, today it has been proven once again that the unjust and cruel ones cannot achieve their goal against the righteousness. Newroz was also written in history as Mazlum Doğan’s slogan not to surrender by turning his body into a ball of fire against the imposition of “Kurds’ fate is slavery”, under the most despicable tortures. The fire of rebellion, which flared up again, grew irreversibly in the mountains and cities under the leadership of the Kurdish National Movement. While the guerrilla escalated the rebellion with the awareness that “salvation comes out from the end of the barrel”, the Kurdish people, risking mass massacres, turned Newroz into a day of resistance with serhıldans
  <em>
   [Translator’s note: word that refers to the Kurdish uprisings against national oppression from the old Turkish State].
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Newroz is no longer just a holiday or celebration for the peoples of the Middle East, but also it is the fire of uninterrupted struggle built by those who oppose historical injustice with their historical resistance. Newroz; It has become a celebration of oppressed peoples, beliefs and nations to challenge injustice.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialist-capitalist system and its servants are targeting the oppressed peoples and nations by using their war machines and all oppression means. As the conflict between imperialists sharpens, regional wars become more common, chauvinism escalates all over the world, and hostilities between nations are fueled. Palestine and Kurdish nations are subjected to destruction attacks by Zionism and Fascism, the servants of imperialism, for the freedom they demand. The imperialist system and its lackeys are carrying out constant and strong attacks, burdening the people the economic crisis they are experiencing.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   More struggle against fascism, stronger organizations and stronger unity of revolutionary forces are required. However, it is not possible to regress and defeat fascism through ballot boxes, parliaments, municipalities and the now completely limited legal field work. It is vital to turn squares, streets and all areas into battlefields against fascism and to create stronger organizations. The fascist dictatorship acts armed from head to toe with the apparatus of force. The struggle with force against force, with weapons against weapons, is essential.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    The spirit of Newroz
   </strong>
   is the armed organized rebellion of the people.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Newroz
   </strong>
   is a call to break the chains for salvation.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Newroz
   </strong>
   is about handling the struggle with a revolutionary spirit, not with a liberal spirit.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Newroz
   </strong>
   is a call to organize to win the future and to expand the struggle with guerrilla struggle, which is the jugular vein of the People’s War.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    -Happy New Year!
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    -Long live the Fire of Newroz Rebellion!
   </strong>

   reported
  </a>
  that Tesla’s first European gigafactory recently endured sabotage from activists calling themselves the Volcano Group. They set a high-voltage power mast ablaze on Tuesday, knocking out power to the car maker’s plant, as well as to nearby residents. Production was shuttered until this week and losses of nearly $1 billion were estimated.
  <br>
<br>
  A local water utility found evidence that the factory has been polluting the water supply with phosphorus and nitrogen compounds at levels up to six times the legal limit. Meanwhile residents in the area voted against an expansion of the Tesla factory. The referendum wasn’t binding, but protesters have been camping in the woods to prevent clearing attempts.
  <br>
<br>
  The militant attack once more frightened the authorities in Germany. It is
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/tesla-case-shows-grids-need-attention-says-germanys-westenergie/ar-BB1jK8l4">
   reported
  </a>
  that CEO Katherina Reiche of a E.ON subsidiary called upon politicians to step up responses to incidents such as the arson attack near Tesla’s gigafactory near Berlin. According to her security measures needed reviewing and a better legal framework to be created. “Critical infrastructure is vulnerable,” she said.
  <br>
<br>
  “It is probably not possible to protect such a network to a 100% degree at all times,” Reiche said, adding that gas and telecommunications intersections were also exposed to attacks. But transparency rules requiring grid operators to make their infrastructure data publicly available might be in need of review, she said, as they could potentially identify and provide pointers to where to find targets.

  Meanwhile in Germany the witch-hunt against alleged former members of the Red Army Faction continues. German media is full of daily and even hourly reports on the searches. Immediately after the arrest of Daniela Klette (
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/06/germany-supposedly-former-raf-member-arrested/">
   we reported
  </a>
  ) bourgeois press slavering assumed the quick arrests of the supposed companions of Klette, Ernst-Volker Staub and Burkhard Garweg. But until today they remain underground, even though a shelter of Burkhard Garweg was

   reportedly
  </a>
  found.
  <br>
<br/>
  In a raid in Berlin-Friedrichshain up to ten people were arrested and questioned. The raid lasted for several hours. The scene of the raid was a squatters place with barracks and trailers. According to the police Garweg shall have lived in a trailer, which a seized. Shots were heard during the raids and confirmed by the police as “sounds of shots in the context of opening a door”.
 </br></br></p>
<p>
  Publicly a manhunt especially against Burkhard Garweg is on its way with posters showing supposed new mugshots from the period from 2021 to 2024.

</p>
<p>
  It is
  <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/raf-polizei-staub-garweg-ausland-100.html">
   reported
  </a>
  that 65-years-old Daniela Klette shall have stored some 1.2 kilo of gold and some 40,000 Euros money in cash. Also weapons are told to be found in the apartment of Klette: A pistol and two mags of ammunition, as well as a rapid fire rifle plus ammo, a bazooka and a warhead. Also a jammer, several mobile phones and passports are said to be found.
 </p>
<p>
  In his trailer Burkhard Garweg
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/de-de/nachrichten/politik/gesuchtes-raf-mitglied-garweg-betrieb-offenbar-f%C3%A4lscherwerkstatt/ar-BB1jMlRb">
   reportedly
  </a>
  ran a counterfeiting workshop. Utilities and machinery is said to be seized by the police and are investigated. Hence, it is concluded that Garweg now is on the run with a new homemade fake-identity. It is also
  <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/berlin-und-brandenburg/LKA-Ex-RAF-Terrorist-Garweg-moeglicherweise-im-Ausland-article24792802.html">
   reported
  </a>
  that the police supposedly have found clues that hint that Garweg has left Germany and is hiding abroad. These new clues suggest that Garweg has fled to an other European country, according to the main responsible police officer for the case, Friedo de Vries.

<p>
  On the other hand the same Friedo de Vries
  <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/raf-polizei-staub-garweg-ausland-100.html">
   acknowledges
  </a>
  that they are clueless, saying “There is no relevant result of the manhunt until now that led us on concrete traces.” and generally questioning the upcoming results of the manhunt.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Meanwhile there are

   reports
  </a>
  on several fails of the police. The biggest one is surely that Daniela Klette reportedly was able to send a warning to her companions. She asked the undercover cops who arrested her to have a leak and on the toilet send via her mobile phone the warning, then flushing the SIM-card down the toilet.
  <br/>

<p>
  On the first solidarity demonstration with those who are suffering by the witch hunt of the German State in Berlin, hundreds participated, demanding the release of the accused and the end of the terror of the State. The demonstration had a combative mood, fireworks were used and slogans chanted. Another rally was announced for the 17
