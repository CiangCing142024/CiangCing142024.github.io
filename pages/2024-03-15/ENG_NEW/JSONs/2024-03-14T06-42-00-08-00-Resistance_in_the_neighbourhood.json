While he was lack, and while suffering from unbearable pain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Minister of Health, Georgiadis, who did not blame the self -impatience of \"impatience\", since he did not ... lack this medicine for a long time ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  Drug deficiencies, and even those who have a very low price, become more and more frequent. It was not long before we did not find baby syrups and penicillins, during a period of viruses, with parents of young children being in despair and not knowing what to do ... The problem was \"addressed\" with the increase in the price of drugs that They were lacking, since in Greece they were cheap, so their producers were more profitable if they sold them abroad ... So what could they do, to go against their interests?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The ministry has never explained why the Venette has no competence in medicines that are absolutely necessary and are not replaced by any other formulation. Like, for example, the tallium in some psychiatric diseases, which leave patients without treatment ... He didn't ask for the reason, of course ... the situation is so bad that no one knows what to do!\n </p>\n <p>\n  How many people, are they not deteriorating their health, waiting for an appointment or to get out of biopsies, to have a scheduled surgery, or to start chemotherapy, or radiation?\n </p>\n <p>\n  People and workers need to take the situation in our hands! And to fight for equal, complete and free care, for everyone, unconditional and conditions! We cannot wait for those who sacrifice us, at every opportunity, that they will change!\n </p>\n <p>\n  AL\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nurse\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u0391.\u039b.", "\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_14.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
