As it went on, other contingents of comrades joined in, thickening the ranks. The youth continued to paint the slogans:\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \u201cThe Interoceanic Corridor dispossesses and kills poor and indigenous peasants!\u201d\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   ,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \u201c\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Hands off\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    Goes for! \"\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   ,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \u201cWhoever governs, the rights of the people are defended!\u201d\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   ,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \u201cBoycott the bourgeois electoral farce!\u201d\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   ,\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \u201cDon\u2019t vote, organize and\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    struggle!\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    \u201c\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  , among others.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As it went on, the masses were removing electoral propaganda of various candidates and parties. The amount of public money that is spent on the electoral circus of the big bourgeoisie is outrageous; money that the candidates and parties invest in propaganda, advertising, stationery, etc. and which are useless for the people since they only generate garbage while the popular neighborhoods and communities lack public services and, in addition, Oaxaca is suffering a wave of fires at this moment. An example is the communities of San Lucas Quiavin\u00ed, San Pablo G\u00fcila, Santiago Matatl\u00e1n, San Dionicio Ocotepec, among others, whose forests and communal lands have been devastated by fire, showing the technical incapacity of the State, which does not have sufficient logistics and infrastructure to face these disasters, some of them caused by the latifundium and illegal loggers. Perhaps there are no resources to prevent and quell forest fires, but there is a budget for the electoral circus.\n  <strong>\n   That\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   is why the people reject it!\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The march stopped at the PRI headquarters and a brief rally was held there where the comrades recalled the responsibility of this party in the war against the people, particularly during the dirty war that lasted from 1965 to the end of the 80s, and also its responsibility in the counterinsurgency actions against the Zapatista uprising and the EZLN, against the EPR uprising, against the UNAM strike and against the mass movements such as the APPO in 2006 in Oaxaca.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There the activists shouted slogans and painted graffiti. A gigantic rat was drawn on the entrance door with the caption \u201cgarbage dump of history\u201d; all the electoral propaganda was also deposited there and finally the people set fire to it as part of the actions of the boycott against the bourgeois electoral farce.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The march continued towards the main square of the city and during its route thousands of leaflets were distributed explaining to the people our organization\u2019s demands for justice, denouncing the war against the people and call not to vote. The contingents arrived at 12:45 p.m. and the esplanade was immediately filled; there a rally was held and the masses took over the palace of ignominy (or government palace). At the end of the rally, tents were set up, a central module and stalls of our comrades, artisans and street vendors violently evicted by the municipal and state police on the 17\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  of February on the Gurri\u00f3n avenue were placed.\n  <strong>\n   The sit-in is a form of protest and frees spaces, returning them to the people in struggle!\n  </strong>\n  The friends of the League of Communities for the Agrarian Revolution set up a small stand where they exhibited organic products grown by the peasants in the communities in resistance, which are 100% free of agro-chemicals and support the rescue of native seeds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Later, a political-cultural event was held while an enlarged dialogue commission appointed by our organization entered the palace of ignominy to state the demands for justice and the demand their solution.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9911\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jornada-de-lucha-06.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jornada-de-lucha-06.webp\" width=\"639\"/>\n  </figure>\n </div>\n <p>\n  In our political-cultural event we had the participation of the BJP who interpreted revolutionary poetry, in addition a presentation was made on the 153\n  <sup>\n   rd\n  </sup>\n  anniversary of the triumph of the Paris Commune which occurred on the 18\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  of March, 1871, the essay \u201cFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d by the comrades of the Cultural Center of the Studies of the Science of the Proletarian Revolution [Centro Cultural y de Estudios de la Ciencia para la Revoluci\u00f3n Proletaria] (CCECRP) was presented again, and there were greetings from sister organizations such as Section XXII of the SNTE-CNTE who came with a commission,  and the Triqui comrades displaced from San Juan Copala with whom we have shared the struggle in the streets against repression for many years.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9912\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jornada-de-lucha-07.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jornada-de-lucha-07.webp\" width=\"639\"/>\n  </figure>\n </div>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   5\n  </strong>\n  <sup>\n   <strong>\n    th\n   </strong>\n  </sup>\n  <strong>\n   of\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   March.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the morning, after breakfast and the general organization of the contingent, a mass assembly was held in the University Gymnasium of the UABJO in the historic center, which was packed by the sea of red flags that immediately took possession of all the stairs and corridors where the dialogue commission gave a detailed report of the points of discussion with the State and federal government,  as well as the different routes of attention to the various issues.

It is also a way of marking fire against reformism and contemporary revisionism which is already taking up its eternal chant of calling the bourgeois elections \u201ca form of struggle\u201d, joining the last wagon of the electoral train legitimizing the regime.
