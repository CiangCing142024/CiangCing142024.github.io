He told his story as a young Palestinian, the killing of his girlfriend by the Israeli army as they went to school, the dirty hands of the girl's blood, the attempted murder of which he was the victim in 2006 by Israeli soldiers, The 11 shots of firearm from which he was reached, the horror tried by the mother to the sight of his injury and the consequent stroke from which he was reached by losing forever the cognitive skills, his friends killed by the army.\n  </span>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">\n   <br/>\n  </span>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">\n   He claimed to refuse the stigma of the terrorist for himself and for his people, he recalled that all peoples have the right to fight for their freedom against the invading army, compared the Palestinian struggle to that of Italy during resistance, And he stressed that, rather, no western country has ever grown in supporting Ukraine, which has also been armed by the same West. He recalled the horror of the Gaza war and the 30 thousand Palestinian dead of which over two thirds and children, and rhetorically asked who the terrorists are.\n  </span>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">\n   <br/>\n  </span>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: verdana;\">\n   He also recalled that the struggle for Palestine is played in the occupied territories and not elsewhere, referring to this to the articles of newspapers that feared the danger of acts of violence in Italy.
