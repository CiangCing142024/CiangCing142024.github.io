There is a plan that goes until 2028 \n in\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n to which Leonardo aims to grow the three divisions in Puglia, \n The golden aerostructures between Grottaglie and Foggia, helicopters in Brindisi \n and above all electronic defense in Taranto.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  So - and not it \n hide - the defense is what is the clearest perception \n of the change taking place in this historical phase. In these sectors the \n Leonardo wants to become a European leader, strengthen the core \n defense electronics business, helicopters and aircraft of which yes \n He says there is a strong recovery of the market and, of course, there is no \n This strong recovery is surprising given the active participation \n military of Italy in the interimperialist war in progress now by \n More than two years in Ukraine, given her support in the Middle East, \n in particular to the state of Israel, given its presence more \n Recent in the Red Sea.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  So the \n Leonardo direction of travel is to be an actor \n key in the military sector, \u201cincreasing the transformation \n orders in revenues and enhancing the development of products for \n reach this position of leader \".\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  How long \n It concerns the defense electronics on Taranto La Leonardo works \n Much with the Navy. Recall that from the naval base of \n Taranto, one of the greatest naval bases, co -team \n From Italian imperialism and NATO, military missions start \n for war interventions.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  In the same \n time, Leonardo, is said, is not limited only to the European sphere, \n being now an integrated multinational to US companies. So \n It is clear what this situation means: that is confirmed \n which was briefly said by John Reed in the \u201c10 days that \n they upset the world \", that wars mean profits for the \n companies, profits for capital, death and destruction for \n populations, for proletarians, for people, women, children.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  Therefore we \n We have those who produce these war equipment here, these \n death equipment and on these it does its revenues and on these \n Above all, it aims to expand.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  In fact there is \n The other aspect, the allies that Leonardo is looking for and in \n The alliance with Iveco Defense is particular. Here the goal of \n Leonardo is to expand his presence in the industry of \n earthly armaments, given that the Iveco Defgence is said to participate \n to a consortium with the company Leonardo Oto Melara for production \n of armored and armored vehicles.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  This kind of \n production is not hidden but you also want to embellish it, both \n highlighting the other commitments that Leonardo is making \n on the level of safety, of the environment.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  But \"security\" \n what does it mean?\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  We know that \n When it comes to \"security\", also for citizens, with this \n State, with this government, as they say, you have to \u201cput your hand to \n pistol\".\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  As \n it concerns the environment, as regards employment - there will be a \n increase in employment and a transformation especially in \n Puglia of fixed -term hires in stable and definitive hires. \n And here is added the icing on the cake which compared to these \n hiring there will also be a strengthening of the female contribution \n in the company in terms of insertions and presence of women in the \n leadership positions and compared to 30% more on the total of \n employees.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  But it seems - how \n It is said - to make the spirit to a funeral: while producing \n Death equipment we talk about safeguarding the climate, we speak \n of environmentalization.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  But from everything \n This emerges how right and necessary what is often is necessary \n taking place also in various initiatives, in events for the \n Palestine, that is, to report, attack, make the principals \n against Leonardo, because it is the most emblematic reality of this \n Active complicity of the Italian government, of the imperialist state \n Italian, to the wars that affect peoples and destroy, \n They carry on the genocides as in Palestine.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  This complaint, \n These struggle principals must continue.\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "The whole press in these days speaks of Leonardo and his revenues, of his development and above all of the fact that Leonardo is prepared ...", "author": ["prolcomra"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-14-marzo-dove-ce-guerra-per.html", "source_name": "proletari comunisti"}
