   . The federal government celebrates the cooperation and calls the Philippines "important partners for Germany in Southeast Asia". One now wants to continue in the economic sector, in particular state German investment guarantees for the capital export of German imperialism are to be expanded, said Chancellor Scholz. The goal is a free trade agreement between the EU and the Philippines, but also the other Asean countries. At the same time, German imperialism strives for cheap workers from the Philippines, especially women in the health sector.

    Scholz spoke, among other things, about Filipino, "which are important for the European and German economy, for example". Marcos Jr. spoke more about military aspects of the meeting. He underlined that "Germany has helped my country's armed forces since 1974". Germany is thus the “second oldest formal formal defense partner of the Philippines, and I have expressed the openness of my government in terms of discussions about a collaboration that concerns
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
     goes beyond training
    </span>
    And also areas such as cyber and maritime areas ”. The construction of capacities and skills of the coast guard by Germany was also requested. On request, Marcos Jr. Underlined: “We also have an intensive exchange with the Federal Republic of Germany in the field of training of the armed forces and the coast guard of my country. We agreed with the Federal Chancellor
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
     that we want to expand that

    "He also did not miss the opportunity to invite German imperialist monopolies such as Siemens, Lufthansa, Deutsche Bank, Bayer, Bosch to loot the Philippines.

  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
   German imperialism will therefore promote the exploitation and oppression of the Filipino people in its favor. It is clear and yet deeply judged that a mafioso, such as Schloz, and a murderer, such as Marcos, share such efforts. Such is neither in the interests of the people in Germany nor the Philippines, but diametrically opposed. The revolutionaries in this country have to deceive themselves and fight it, not only with beautiful words, but in concrete deeds, firmly united with the Filipino people and their struggle, everything else would be smooth.
