  "Wearing." This should be the German army again. At least when it comes to Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. For this purpose, the Ministry of Defense, which he is subject to, has now submitted a concept paper in which the first measures are taken to advance the Bundeswehr's armament.
 </p>
 <p>
  The corresponding document is entitled
  <a href="https://esut.de/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ergebnisbericht.pdf">
   "Bundeswehr of the future".
  </a>
  In the document, various points are mentioned that must be executed to make the German army "war -related" again. One point of this is, among other things, the strengthening of the sub -forces. Partial forces are a division of the armed forces into various specialized areas. In Germany, the army comprises three partial forces. Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, there will also be a fourth partial dispute that affects the area of the "cyber and information room" in the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, there should also be restructuring in the leadership of the operations that aim to strengthen centralization. In the future, an “operational management command of the Bundeswehr” should be created in the future. In the future, as the document means “from a single source”. this operational management command are controlled and coordinated centrally.
 </p>
 <p>
  Furthermore, under the motto: "The Bundeswehr is a whole to be aligned with the emergency" that the Bundeswehr must be logistically able to be able to wage war at any time. To this end, the military administration should already be planned for “emergencies”. According to a lack of need, such as infrastructure, personnel, material, etc. should be recognized and provided.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if only marginally, the question of conscription is raised in the document. This is how the proposal provides that there should be structural and process changes, especially in the area of personnel. The structures should "largely smooth" and "especially in
  <br/>
  Situations of the highest turmoil and large overall coordination effort
  <br/>
  be folded off. ”A coordination office for“ controlling the ability to grow up ”is also to be created. This should be able to “quickly the personnel
  <br/>
  To be able to ensure the need to cover ". I.e. in a war in a war, young people as cannon food for the German bourgeoisie.
 </p>
 <p>
  The creation of such a coordination office is also relevant for a future reintroduction of compulsory military service. As is known, the German defense or one could rather say War Minister Pistorius is a vehement fighter to reintroduce compulsory military service. In the context, it also makes sense that it requires to create structures that are able to be able to work immediately after the introduction of such a compulsory military service.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ultimately, it can be said that the German bourgeoisie is increasingly cries out after war. The document mentioned already realizes in the introduction that it is not a question of using the Bundeswehr as a defensive army for national defense. So it says:
  <br/>
  <em>
   “Germany as a global nation in all matters will therefore have to be able to counter threats and destabilizations at home, in Europe and in the world at any time. For this purpose, the Bundeswehr also provides instruments of action. ”
  </em>
  <br/>
  Even if it is repeatedly spoken of the "defense" of Germany, it is more about defending the economic interests of German imperialism with fire and lead all over the world against the oppressed peoples and the imperialist competitors. A fact that is confirmed by a look at the current Bundeswehr's current missions.
