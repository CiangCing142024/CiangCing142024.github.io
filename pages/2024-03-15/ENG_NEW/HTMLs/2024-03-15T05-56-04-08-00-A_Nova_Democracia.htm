  . The purpose of the act is to remark once again the rejection and condemnation of the coup, whether it is the one consummated in 1964, or the one that now gains freely in the barracks and in society; as well as demarcating with conciliation and appeasement that only feed the coup plotters.

  About the political meaning of the act
 </h4>
 <p>
  No manifesto do ato, or
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  It states: "It is urgent that we undertake serious combat of coup, condemning the 60 years of the military coup of 1964 and the coup still today." “Those events are not a
  <em>
   trauma
  </em>
  to be forgotten. Want to forget it, as the President of the Republic Luiz Inácio and the ultra-rightist General Hamilton Mourão, obviously competes for his repetition. After all, it is not a healing wound: as January 8 has shown, the wound is still open and without proper treatment. Even today, as much as in the 1960s, the weeds of coup are growing through all the halls and surroundings of meetings in the barracks. ”
 </p>
 <p>
  The text also points out that "the same policy of vigorous appeasement has been repeated since 1988, the genuine democrats, progressive and revolutionaries will hire a new military crisis, which rests on an irresolved base, will be more serious and dangerous."
 </p>
 <p>
  “As part of combating the policy of appeasement (only a way of cowing),
  <strong>
   We demand that the special committee on the dead and missing politicians be reinstated
  </strong>
  by the government of shift, because it is a demand felt from family members and of unique importance to bring to the national political debate the fascist horrors of the military regime. It is necessary to defend the democratic freedoms, already so much and under permanent attacks, through the urgent mobilization, ”adds the manifesto.
