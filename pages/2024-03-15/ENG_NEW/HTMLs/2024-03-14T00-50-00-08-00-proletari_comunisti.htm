        We will famous 
  the 114th International Day of Women's Women at a time 
 in which, on the one hand, Brahmanic Fascism Hindutva has extended his own 
 Tentacles in every sphere of life, and on the other hand, imperialism has 
 intensified its exploitation measures towards peoples e 
 of the oppressed nations.
        <b>
         Now we are under the yoke of two monstrous 
 terror. The Brahmanic patriarchy is a peculiar Indian room of the 
 horrors. In a semi-colonial and semi-infeudal society, where women are 
  forced to live in this horror room
        </b>
        So what is the value of the constitution and fundamental rights?
        <b>
         The 
  women face multitudes of economic exploitation and 
 non -economic that remains unpunished and male domination does from 
 barrier to the general vision of society.

        That it is 
 regions torn by the war of western Asia, Palestine or 
 of Ukraine or, whether it is Dhaka clothing factories, 
  of the Manipur Valley or the forestry belts of the Center 
 of India, women around the world are facing the fire 
 of imperialist crises. In India, the condition of the woman is not 
 Sublime as propagated by the fascist of Bjp Narendra Modi. The 
 Fascism Brahmanico Hindutva with the support of imperialism gives 
 Sleeping and strength to one of the most inhuman forms of hierarchy system 
 social that transforms women into an object of 'pleasure' e 
 exploitation.

         The 
  financial capital for its enhancement requires a market 
 unified, source of low cost workforce and abundant resources 
 natural. The oppression of women in the era of dying capitalism is 
  interconnected with the autocracy of financial capital. Incapable of 
 Seeing these ropes that bind: it is like punishing in the dark. There is not 
 doubt that the capitalism of the free-cambio, of the period 
 manufacturing, has brought a significant number of darkened women 
  secret of the household chores to the factories. Because of this 
 unprecedented expansion of social production, the movements of 
 women of the working class entered the scene and gave birth to the 
 subjectivity of women's rights movements.

        men. Borghese Republic only in words promises 
 equality to women, but actually supports the patriarchal system 
 Oppressive that looks at the bottom of women. The society 
 capitalist transforms every object into goods and women do not do 
 exception and in reality in many forms. The deceptive bourgeois phrases 
 they console women only in their imagination but in reality those 
 phrases deny the existence of individuality to the women who brings 
 to the absence of democratic rights. In the Manuvadi system [privileges for 
 High caste] The woman is not considered as a free being. From the 
 birth to death must be under the domain of the male. The right 
 to possess the productive forces, in particular the earth and the law 
 On the sphere of reproduction it was denied by the dominant classes in 
 India.
