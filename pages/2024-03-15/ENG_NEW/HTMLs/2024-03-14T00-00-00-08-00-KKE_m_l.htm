   The KKE is calling on Thursday 14/3 today, at 7pm in the Propylaea, the gathering and march of the provocative prosecutor's prosecution for the 12-year-old Sepolia case, which acquits the victims and condemns the victims!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
   BELOW THE POLICY OF A SYSTEM THAT MAKES-SUPPORT-DIAGNOSIS!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
   Let's be all there ...
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anger and indignation at the prosecutor's vulgar proposal in the 12 -year -old case from Sepolia.
  </strong>
  The rape turned into meetings for a 12 -year -old child who were systematically rushed by dozens of adults "above all suspicion". In fact, the 12 -year -old is considered guilty as it is considered to be half of the meeting. The rapist and mastic Micho is considered innocent of the accusations of rape and mastrian. Just "facilitated" the 12 -year -old. All the categories fall into the mother with no doubt.
 </p>
 <p>
  The prosecutor's attitude is "consistent". He served the political system and its expressors to the end. Micho knows and hides many and powerful. ND local commander, with close ties with the church, while at the same time coordinating the trade of people and prostitution in the Sepolia region. How much dirt? How much canoe? What can justice first of all?
 </p>
 <p>
  From the first moment the case was unveiled and the crimes were revealed, the system did everything he could to cover the victims and kill the victims. The mother was in prison, her 12 -year -old and her brothers were threatened with their lives. Without any psychological, medical or financial support, she even deprived her of the right to come into contact with her mother.
  <strong>
   State, police, judges, did what they could to convince all 12 years that they should not speak and report their rapists.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The people are angry in the face of injustice and the concealment of the rotten. Similar fate had other cases of concealment of rich and high -ranking rapists and assassins. From the agriculture case in Thessaloniki to the mass crime of Tempi, the so -called "justice" presents the same consequence, serves the laws and those for whom they are written. The few and the powerful guaranteed rights and freedoms and whenever needed, mitigating and doubts are discovered. For the many, the poor, the oppressed, the law is relentless, a bite on his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  The same "consistent" is the police, which conceals rape, inside and outside the police stations. It does not discriminate to rapists and not, it covers them all. And he is always at the forefront, ready to suppress any demonstration, concentration, strike. With the same consistency he chased and hit the demonstrators yesterday in Sepolia. The people who came out on the road to express their anger, fight for a fair decision and denouncing the concealment was confronted with MATs and Chemicals. This supports the attack on the people and their rights.
 </p>
 <p>
  The people are angry, not only today, not only because they do not tolerate a criminal and a basis like mich, but also for all the other suffering that has loaded him. Private universities, crime in Tempi, accuracy, disasters, war, auctions, terrorism, criminal code, fascism, afternoon surgeries, carinating, poverty….
 </p>
 <p>
  This system has condemned us long before the crimes are committed. We will not let it acquit the culprits.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Guilty to the capitalist system itself, governments, judges, repression bodies.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   We must also look consistent with the 12 -year -old, towards ourselves. To condemn Micho and all the culprits! To hope for a life with rights!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   All on the streets! The river is not turning back!
  </strong>
