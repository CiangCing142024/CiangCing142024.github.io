  About the book
 </h4>
 <p>
  How to resist in the face of a hard combat? How to overcome jail? How to raise the revolutionary flag at the darkest moments? These questions that are commonly raised by true Democrats, when dealing with one of the bloodiest periods in our history, are answered through the great example of Alipio de Freitas.
 </p>
 <p>
  The revolutionary trajectory of Alípio de Freitas, a tireless militant in the cause of the liberation of the peoples, and his resistance in the prisons of the military-fascist regime in Brazil are recorded in Resisting is Necessary, a book of his work that had its first edition published in 1981.
 </p>
 <p>
  Alipio played a highlighted role in the direction of the peasant alloys in the 1960s, performing the task of political instructor, occupying the general secretary of his organization. After the 1964 military-fascist coup, he moves to clandestinity, and is fully dedicated to the revolutionary peasant struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  Persecuted, he exiled in Mexico and then headed to Cuba, where he held courses in political and military formation and prepared his return to Brazil to continue the revolutionary struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1970 he is arrested by the green-fashionwater regime. It spends almost ten years imprisoned in different arrests, facing and resisting the most brutal torture. Without ever folding, he defeated his tormentors. His memories of resistance in jails were recorded alive in the book “Resist is Precise”.
 </p>
 <p>
  His memory and legacy, in turn, continue to be honored by those who now wield his flag. As highlighted by the National Commission of the Leagues of Poor Peasants (LCP), in a message to Guadalupe Magalhães, tireless and inseparable companion of Alípio de Freitas: "We will always honor our Honorary President, raise his name, fulfill the dream for which he fought so hard."
