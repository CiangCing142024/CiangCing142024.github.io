  The Greek government with its decision to send the frigate "Hydra" to the Red Sea as part of the European Union's mission Eunavfor Aspides escalates the country's involvement in imperialist philosopher war designs. After all, the operational center of the mission is in Larissa and at the same time the base of Souda and other American bases in our country are actively involved in the genocide of the Palestinian people, in every way reinforcing the fascist-Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Already the frigate of the Navy on Wednesday 13/3 involved in the first war in the Red Sea war, taking rocket shots at Houthi's unmanned drones. The Minister of National Defense N. Dendias said with cynicism that "we are proud of the businesses of our homeland that are being carried out to protect the national interest ...".
 </p>
 <p p="">
  <p>
   The ND government, bourgeois political staff and local capitalist order are dangerous. They drag our people into war. They are preparing us to bleed again for the interests of American and European imperialists. On the one hand, Mr Mitsotakis' visit to Ukraine as a US medium and the mission of war equipment. On the other hand, the country's accession to the US geopolitical planning for the NA Mediterranean and the Middle East now accompanied by the Navy. They drag the country and the people at the center of imperialist competition for the world's re-firming, baptizing a national interest in the US-EU.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the same time that the government, on behalf of the foreign and local capital, escalates the attack on the rights of the people by sowing poverty, poverty, accuracy, fills the funds of the imperialist war industries with two -euro. On this basis, the lives of the people and the workers will continue to sacrifice on the altar of profit. Like the lives of the two Greek seafarers, they were sacrificed for the profits of Greek shipowners, while the government and the system celebrate the success of the Greek frigate Hydra, one of the "Navy of our Navy", during its involvement two unmanned aircraft.
  </p>
  <p>
   The people, the workers and the youth will not become meat in the cannons of imperialists. There is a greater need than ever to grow and massive an anti-imperialist movement that requires the country to be unraveled by imperialist war plans that struggle to leave the imperialists from the country that declare its tangible solidarity. In the struggle of the Palestinian people!
