 <p>
  Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s visit to Berlin on March 13 was met with protests by Filipino migrants.
 </p>
 <p>
  ALPAS Pilipinas and GABRIELA-Germany led the protests. It was also attended by allied organizations, such as Solidarity International, ARARAT Armenian Collective, MLPD, German Filipino Friendship, Kurdish Women, Resbak, Philippine Buro and Interburo.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to BAYAN-Europe, Marcos Jr’s visit to Germany and other European countries from March 11-15 should serve as an occasion for all Filipino migrants and human rights defenders to condemn the brutal regime that commit gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law (IHL).
 </p>
 <p>
  “It is wrong to welcome this Marcos junket, the main purpose of which is to deodorize the stinking image of Marcos and his family in the international community,” according to the BAYAN-Europe statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Historically, the allied organizations in Germany have been among the most committed supporters of the movement against the Marcos fascist dictatorship in the 70s and 80s.
 </p>
 <p>
  Marcos Jr’s visit is expected to seal negotiations for Germany to supply drones to the Philippines supposedly for maritime security against China. This Military aid will be awarded amid the gross violations of international humanitarian law and heavy militarization and indiscriminate bombing of the countryside perpetrated by the Marcos regime.
 </p>
 <p>
  The protesters also called on the European Union to stop supporting the Marcos Jr regime by ending military aid. Germany and the EU are both signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which supplies military aid, weapons and other military equipment to the Philippines.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can be recalled that during the Duterte regime, the EU strongly condemned the war on drugs and human rights violations. In February 2022, the EU Parliament issued a resolution that threatened to withdraw the Philippines’ GSP+ and other incentives, such as the benefit of zero tariff (no layer tax) on goods from the EU, if the Duterte regime did not stop the violations. Germany is the largest trading partner of the Philippines in Europe.
