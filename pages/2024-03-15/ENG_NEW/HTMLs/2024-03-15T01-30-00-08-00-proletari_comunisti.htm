 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All the press these days speaks of Leonardo and his own 
 revenues, its development and above all the fact that Leonardo does 
 preparing to become European leader, even in the market also 
 world, as regards the production of armaments.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start from 
 data, because they are clear, explanatory of what politics is 
 of Leonardo and the policy of the Italian State, within the 
 International situation regarding wars 
 imperialist.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The data that 
 They come out of Leonardo speak of large revenues: in 2023 there 
 There were 15.29 billion, orders for 17.9 billion, doubled 
 the dividend for € 0.28 per share and, above all, for 
 Exercise 2024 is mentioned of growing revenues up to 16.8 billion, 
 Growth orders and growing cash flow etc. etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is also said 
 Where, in fact, Leonardo is strengthening and this 
 strengthening takes place in Puglia, especially where there are 105 orders 
 billions and revenues for 95 billion. There is a plan that goes until 2028 
 in
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 to which Leonardo aims to grow the three divisions in Puglia, 
 The golden aerostructures between Grottaglie and Foggia, helicopters in Brindisi 
 and above all electronic defense in Taranto.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So - and not it 
 hide - the defense is what is the clearest perception 
 of the change taking place in this historical phase. In these sectors the 
 Leonardo wants to become a European leader, strengthen the core 
 defense electronics business, helicopters and aircraft of which yes 
 He says there is a strong recovery of the market and, of course, there is no 
 This strong recovery is surprising given the active participation 
 military of Italy in the interimperialist war in progress now by 
 More than two years in Ukraine, given her support in the Middle East, 
 in particular to the state of Israel, given its presence more 
 Recent in the Red Sea.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So the 
 Leonardo direction of travel is to be an actor 
 key in the military sector, “increasing the transformation 
 orders in revenues and enhancing the development of products for 
 reach this position of leader ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How long 
 It concerns the defense electronics on Taranto La Leonardo works 
 Much with the Navy. Recall that from the naval base of 
 Taranto, one of the greatest naval bases, co -team 
 From Italian imperialism and NATO, military missions start 
 for war interventions.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time, Leonardo, is said, is not limited only to the European sphere, 
 being now an integrated multinational to US companies. So 
 It is clear what this situation means: that is confirmed 
 which was briefly said by John Reed in the “10 days that 
 they upset the world ", that wars mean profits for the 
 companies, profits for capital, death and destruction for 
 populations, for proletarians, for people, women, children.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Therefore we 
 We have those who produce these war equipment here, these 
 death equipment and on these it does its revenues and on these 
 Above all, it aims to expand.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fact there is 
 The other aspect, the allies that Leonardo is looking for and in 
 The alliance with Iveco Defense is particular. Here the goal of 
 Leonardo is to expand his presence in the industry of 
 earthly armaments, given that the Iveco Defgence is said to participate 
 to a consortium with the company Leonardo Oto Melara for production 
 of armored and armored vehicles.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This kind of 
 production is not hidden but you also want to embellish it, both 
 highlighting the other commitments that Leonardo is making 
 on the level of safety, of the environment.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But "security" 
 what does it mean?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We know that 
 When it comes to "security", also for citizens, with this 
 State, with this government, as they say, you have to “put your hand to 
 pistol".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As 
 it concerns the environment, as regards employment - there will be a 
 increase in employment and a transformation especially in 
 Puglia of fixed -term hires in stable and definitive hires. 
 And here is added the icing on the cake which compared to these 
 hiring there will also be a strengthening of the female contribution 
 in the company in terms of insertions and presence of women in the 
 leadership positions and compared to 30% more on the total of 
 employees.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it seems - how 
 It is said - to make the spirit to a funeral: while producing 
 Death equipment we talk about safeguarding the climate, we speak 
 of environmentalization.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But from everything 
 This emerges how right and necessary what is often is necessary 
 taking place also in various initiatives, in events for the 
 Palestine, that is, to report, attack, make the principals 
 against Leonardo, because it is the most emblematic reality of this 
 Active complicity of the Italian government, of the imperialist state 
 Italian, to the wars that affect peoples and destroy, 
 They carry on the genocides as in Palestine.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This complaint, 
 These struggle principals must continue.
