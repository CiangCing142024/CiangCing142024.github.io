    The masters of industry and the 
 finance, through the voice of their newspapers and their spokespersons, are happy 
 of the latest data published by Eurostat and the ECB because they certify
   </span>
   <b style="text-align: justify;">
    a 
 lowering of workers' wages at European level.
   </b>
   <span style="text-align: justify;">
    This, second 
 An article by the "Economists" of Milano Finanza on March 12, should bring 
 to a lowering of inflation and therefore to the possibility that the ECB cuts i 
 interest rates, that is, of the interests that masters and banks pay when 
 They take money on loan from the central bank.

  " That 
 they would have climbed but not able to overcome the inflation rate “Goldman 
 Sachs provides that the annual figure will drop from 4.6% to 3.9% in the first quarter 
 2024 and that the overall labor cost index will fall to 3.3% in the fourth 
 quarter."
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  While journalists express the 
 Usually cynicism: "
  <b>
   The latest numbers on salaries and profits are reassuring
  </b>
  ”, 
 they say. Of course, reassuring for the masters! And in fact they point out that “the 
 descent of inflation
  <b>
   It also makes requests for strong increases unlikely 
 wages
  </b>
  .”
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Salari are a fixed thought 
 of the masters and their agents: “The ECB president Christine Lagarde has indicated
  <b>
   The importance of data on employee wages
  </b>
  at the end of the 
 Board of Directors of 7 March. " And it could not be otherwise, given that i 
 wages are related to profits -
  <i>
   (On this we recommend reading Marx's text: "Salary price and profit")
  </i>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  These latter data, therefore, “damage 
 further tranquility on the
  <b>
   descent of inflation
  </b>
  : that too
  <i>
   core
  </i>
  ,
  <b>
   net of energy and food
  </b>
  , now it could drop beyond the ECB projections ”.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  This means that the cost of energy 
 (oil, gas etc.) increases, and also increases the cost of food, that is, yes 
 In fact, lower the purchasing power of the workers! Are the
  <b>
   others
  </b>
  goods, 
 therefore, that fall into price, and in fact Panetta, current governor of the 
 Bank of Italy says "that" to the stagnation of total production costs you do 
 adds
  <b>
   the weakness of the demand for goods and services
  </b>
  …»
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  These data, therefore, also say 
 There is no growth that there is no growth:
  <b>
   “In recent days the ECB has 
 Cut once again the growth estimates,
  </b>
  further postponing the 
 resumption. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Also in Italy the masters have 
 made less loan requests
  <b>
   : “Credit is in contraction
  </b>
  , as 
 they showed the data on Italy yesterday. " But not only and not so much because the rates 
 of the ECB are high, but above all
  <b>
   because thanks to the impressive 
 mountain of billions of profits did not need it
  </b>
  !
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  From any point you take the 
 data that periodically the statistics institutions emit
  <b>
   inevitably 
 they deny the propaganda of governments and masters
  </b>
  , in particular that 
 of the fascist Meloni who tells us that there is more work, there is more money 
 etc. etc. and shouts stronger in the hope of making the law forget 
 On the minimum salary!

   Within the crisis and still inside 
 the caravan ... however there is no request for "
  </b>
  <span style="text-align: justify;">
   strong wage increases ”such as 
 The masters always fear, and it is clear then that from all these data it skips 
 outside the need not to continue to undergo the rise in prices first, the 
 so -called caravan, and then again the decrease in wages! It takes, therefore, 
 there
  </span>
  <b style="text-align: justify;">
   Battle for strong wage increases
  </b>
  <span style="text-align: justify;">
   that not only is it necessary (e 
 Certainly not to "recover" what has been lost with inflation), but which has 
 Possibility of success if conducted with consistency and determination!
