   We received a subsequent short report on an event on the occasion of March 8 in Hamburg, which we document here.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  On March 7, the Red Women's Committee, as part of the Info Café captured in the international center B5, carried out an event on the occasion of the International Frauenkampft Day. Proletarian feminism was explained, about the origin of the oppression of the woman, as well as some aspects of the legal situation of women in the FRG. After the lecture there was a question and discussion and there was exchanged ideas in many conversations.
