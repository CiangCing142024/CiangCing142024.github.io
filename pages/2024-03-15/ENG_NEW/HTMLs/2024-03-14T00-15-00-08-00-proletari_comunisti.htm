   In their fight against the authorities as well as against individual bourgeois, the workers showed themselves everywhere intellectually and morally superior, and in their conflicts with the so -called "employers of work", they showed that now they, the workers, were the cultured men and that the capitalists, however, were rough men. Furthermore, they led the struggle mostly with a sense of humor that is the best proof of how much they were sure of their cause and aware of their superiority.
