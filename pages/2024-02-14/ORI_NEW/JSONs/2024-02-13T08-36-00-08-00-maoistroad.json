On this occasion, we are going to celebrate\nPeople's War Day across the country. On this historic occasion, our\nparty pays heartfelt tributes to all the immortal martyrs who\nattained martyrdom in the process of the Nepalese revolution,\nexpresses our sincere respect to the disappeared, wounded, and\ndisabled warriors, and commemorates the records of sacrifice,\nheroism, and devotion presented by the Nepalese people. Also, our\nparty salutes the families of martyrs and disappeared warriors,\nentire party members, supporters and well-wishers, respectable people\nand fraternal parties, and the world proletariat.\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.21cm;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\n     In\nNepal, which was in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial condition, the\nGreat People's War that was declared exactly twenty-eight years ago\nwith a resolve of accomplishing a new democratic revolution\ninternally against feudalism, comprador and bureaucratic capitalism\nand externally against imperialism and expansionism had been able to\nbuild seven divisions of the People's Liberation Army, establish and\ndefend base areas and people's governments in the countryside in a\nshort period. It disseminated a new message of revolution and social\nchange across the world and posed an immense challenge to world\nimperialism. However, due to the neo-revisionist deviation and\nimmense treason of the principal leader from within the Maoist\nmovement, the Nepalese revolution has now suffered a severe setback.\nThe principal leader who led the People's War yesterday has today\nbecome a reliable puppet of imperialism/expansionism, whereas another\nleader has reached a subjective conclusion that Marxism has been\nirrelevant.\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.21cm;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\n     The\nlimited democratic rights that the Nepalese people had gained because\nof the People's War and the Mass Movement are being seized gradually.\nThe economic crisis in the country has become grave, and the trade\ndeficit is skyrocketing. Thanks to widespread unemployment and high\nprice rises, working-class people are worried about the problem of\nmaking ends meet. The Nepalese ruling class does not think of\ndeveloping a self-reliant national economy and opening the door to\nemployment by effectively administering the agricultural and\nindustrial sectors in the country. On the contrary, the Nepalese\nruling class feels \"proud\" for the remittance the country\naccumulates by selling youths in the name of foreign employment has\nsustained the country's economy.\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.21cm;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\n     The\nNepalese ruling class has opened the way to make Nepal a military\nbase of the United States by signing with US imperialism the\nanti-national agreements like MCC and SPP, which are integral parts\nof the Indo-Pacific strategy. The Nepalese rulers have lost the\ncourage even to diplomatically oppose the border encroachment and\npolitical, economic, and cultural interference by the Indian ruling\nclass in Nepal. All this is the result of the senior leaders of\nNepal's parliamentarian parties becoming dependable agents of\nimperialism/expansionism in the process of colonizing the country. In\nthis way, the question of the country's national independence,\ndemocracy, and people's livelihood is becoming grave with the passing\ndays. It is the bitter reality of Nepal today.\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.21cm;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\n     People's\ndissatisfaction with state power, the system, and the parliamentarian\npolitical parties is boiling over, and the regressive elements are\ntrying to take advantage of it. Regressive elements cannot be an\noption forthis.\nThus, scientific socialism through the new democratic revolution in\nNepal has become an urgent necessity.\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" lang=\"en-US\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.21cm;\">\n  <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman, serif;\">\n   <span style=\"font-size: small;\">\n    <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">\n     The\nprocess of social revolution is not straightforward; it advances via\nscores of cycles of revolution and counter-revolution. The Nepalese\nrevolution has suffered a setback, but the process of revolution has\nnot stopped. It is advancing in a new way in the new situation. We\nhave formed the Revolutionary Communist Party of Nepal by uniting the\nerstwhile CPN (Revolutionary Maoist) and CPN (Bahumat). We are\npreparing for revolution by learning from the positive and negative\nexperiences of Nepalese and world proletarian revolutions by\ncreatively applying Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to the Nepalese\nspecificity.
