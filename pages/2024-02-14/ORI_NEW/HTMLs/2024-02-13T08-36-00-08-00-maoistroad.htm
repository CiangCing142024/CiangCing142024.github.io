     Under
the leadership of the erstwhile CPN (Maoist), the Great People's War,
which was initiated on February 13, 1996, has entered its
twenty-ninth year today. On this occasion, we are going to celebrate
People's War Day across the country. On this historic occasion, our
party pays heartfelt tributes to all the immortal martyrs who
attained martyrdom in the process of the Nepalese revolution,
expresses our sincere respect to the disappeared, wounded, and
disabled warriors, and commemorates the records of sacrifice,
heroism, and devotion presented by the Nepalese people. Also, our
party salutes the families of martyrs and disappeared warriors,
entire party members, supporters and well-wishers, respectable people
and fraternal parties, and the world proletariat.

     In
Nepal, which was in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial condition, the
Great People's War that was declared exactly twenty-eight years ago
with a resolve of accomplishing a new democratic revolution
internally against feudalism, comprador and bureaucratic capitalism
and externally against imperialism and expansionism had been able to
build seven divisions of the People's Liberation Army, establish and
defend base areas and people's governments in the countryside in a
short period. It disseminated a new message of revolution and social
change across the world and posed an immense challenge to world
imperialism. However, due to the neo-revisionist deviation and
immense treason of the principal leader from within the Maoist
movement, the Nepalese revolution has now suffered a severe setback.
The principal leader who led the People's War yesterday has today
become a reliable puppet of imperialism/expansionism, whereas another
leader has reached a subjective conclusion that Marxism has been
irrelevant.

     The
limited democratic rights that the Nepalese people had gained because
of the People's War and the Mass Movement are being seized gradually.
The economic crisis in the country has become grave, and the trade
deficit is skyrocketing. Thanks to widespread unemployment and high
price rises, working-class people are worried about the problem of
making ends meet. The Nepalese ruling class does not think of
developing a self-reliant national economy and opening the door to
employment by effectively administering the agricultural and
industrial sectors in the country. On the contrary, the Nepalese
ruling class feels "proud" for the remittance the country
accumulates by selling youths in the name of foreign employment has
sustained the country's economy.

   <span style="font-size: small;">
    <span style="color: #0e101a;">
     The
Nepalese ruling class has opened the way to make Nepal a military
base of the United States by signing with US imperialism the
anti-national agreements like MCC and SPP, which are integral parts
of the Indo-Pacific strategy. The Nepalese rulers have lost the
courage even to diplomatically oppose the border encroachment and
political, economic, and cultural interference by the Indian ruling
class in Nepal. All this is the result of the senior leaders of
Nepal's parliamentarian parties becoming dependable agents of
imperialism/expansionism in the process of colonizing the country. In
this way, the question of the country's national independence,
democracy, and people's livelihood is becoming grave with the passing
days. It is the bitter reality of Nepal today.

    <span style="color: #0e101a;">
     People's
dissatisfaction with state power, the system, and the parliamentarian
political parties is boiling over, and the regressive elements are
trying to take advantage of it. Regressive elements cannot be an
option forthis.
Thus, scientific socialism through the new democratic revolution in
Nepal has become an urgent necessity.

     The
process of social revolution is not straightforward; it advances via
scores of cycles of revolution and counter-revolution. The Nepalese
revolution has suffered a setback, but the process of revolution has
not stopped. It is advancing in a new way in the new situation. We
have formed the Revolutionary Communist Party of Nepal by uniting the
erstwhile CPN (Revolutionary Maoist) and CPN (Bahumat). We are
preparing for revolution by learning from the positive and negative
experiences of Nepalese and world proletarian revolutions by
creatively applying Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to the Nepalese
specificity. On the occasion of the 29
