Thus, Abby was associated with a group of journalists in Gaza to produce the film through the excluded border. It is a documentary on the historical demonstrations of the long way of return, which took place every week from March 2018 to December 2019, but it covers much more. It tells Gaza's story in the past and present, projecting rare archive material that explains the story that has never been recognized by the media. You hear from the victims of the ongoing massacre, including journalists, doctors and the family of internationally recognized paramedic Razan al-Najar. At its core, \"Gaza Fights for Freedom\" is a detailed Israeli army indictment for war crimes with exclusive documents and a stunning cinematic depiction of the Palestinian heroic resistance.\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3\u03a4\u0395\u03a6\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a3"], "labels": ["\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1", "\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7", "\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1", "\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/abby-martin-gaza-fights-for-freedom.html"}
