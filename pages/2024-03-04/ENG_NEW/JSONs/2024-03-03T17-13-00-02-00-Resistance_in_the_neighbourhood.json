The discussion, which was opened by many competitors and friends, put all the popular problems on the table. From accuracy and auctions, hitting health and education, fascism, free spaces, to war and solidarity in Palestine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Obvious, of all positions, was the need - anxiety of \"what do we do, how do we fight\". This question is trying to answer our shape and will give all its strengths immediately to open them in our neighborhoods in better terms. To create resistance fires in every neighborhood, to get the people in their hands.\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhEITCJC-LyCguSehR3omzE-hfKBqTZOImW1ooR-Jbpb9kB9fxrWES9WA9iI2Uid9E9H-4hHp6YUQJm-YBHZNpLKpOpUTa0xPrBvWXdSawlB2Xdw-UzMRQclqtZUb-m-CzAoPpequcTx_aWXQPCq_V3SQjLYHBgKoeZ4l_2YV2TDzo_51HN3bYr1ebnNE/s1600/1709475315617120-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjhEITCJC-LyCguSehR3omzE-hfKBqTZOImW1ooR-Jbpb9kB9fxrWES9WA9iI2Uid9E9H-4hHp6YUQJm-YBHZNpLKpOpUTa0xPrBvWXdSawlB2Xdw-UzMRQclqtZUb-m-CzAoPpequcTx_aWXQPCq_V3SQjLYHBgKoeZ4l_2YV2TDzo_51HN3bYr1ebnNE/s1600/1709475315617120-1.jpg\" width=\"320\"/>\n </div>\n <p>\n  Special reference is worthwhile to address the neighborhood shapes with a corresponding racing orientation in other areas of Athens, such as the roads of Agioi Anargyroi - Kamaterou and Piraeus Popular Resistance, as well as other militants from the rest of the North Athens.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The event ended with the logic on our part for taking the initiative to address and other neighborhood schemes, local bodies, workers 'unions, teachers, parents' associations, to open the issue of attack on education with as massively as possible in our neighborhood. For organizing a demonstration and other actions that will highlight this issue in the neighborhood, so that the people themselves will take it on it. As well as the issue of accuracy and auctions. To enable the neighborhood world to express its anger and take the situation in his hands against conciliation, assignment and fatalism. Finally, we are not convinced by the statements of municipal authorities - Adonis Georgiadis about the \"promise\" of the Nea Ionia Health Center and the return of the pharmacy and that we have to organize new mobilizations on the issue until we have the right to equal, complete, complete, free, free Care for everyone.\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrc2ehCea3Z24iNbjt1oBo3pXavmfiNedNEh6kxAm9ZoTPWnW4KyqPyeWTHq4bdljR8n_njv70cvK9vhmsFUItQ9epeYuKx2pRruKgK6sS5QnACBwC9hd03jHHCe_xOW7-QSlpzD6Lz723NNMaSaVX6sbrXqxQEPIzTuwuzrGgWuGIc0hces256bG24Ys/s1600/1709475311110523-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrc2ehCea3Z24iNbjt1oBo3pXavmfiNedNEh6kxAm9ZoTPWnW4KyqPyeWTHq4bdljR8n_njv70cvK9vhmsFUItQ9epeYuKx2pRruKgK6sS5QnACBwC9hd03jHHCe_xOW7-QSlpzD6Lz723NNMaSaVX6sbrXqxQEPIzTuwuzrGgWuGIc0hces256bG24Ys/s1600/1709475311110523-2.jpg\" width=\"320\"/>\n </div>\n <p>\n  We thank everyone and everyone for supporting the effort we are making in our neighborhoods this time.
