He \"apologized\" for the cases of broadcasting licenses and Novartis, saying that \"there were no proper handling\"! And that cost the election to SYRIZA. The hint was clear: he should not have \"put it\" with the media of the media and the drug. Opera -rewarding means that he had to have made even a right turn since then!\n <br/>\n <br/>\n He never raised the issue of exit the country from the eurozone, which had repeatedly clarified the President of the Republic. Varoufakis and SIA were probably acting ... Autonomous and deserted by the Prime Minister! Perhaps the ruling class that did not \"negotiate\" (the way it is said) how much its imperialist patrons would degrade it. 'Or maybe not;\n <br/>\n <br/>\n If these \"mistakes\" had not been made and the system of power inside and outside the country would remain \"clean\" and the bipartisanship would be long before today. Probably his party.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Tsipras \"Capital\" (so we were told about SYRIZA executives as the recent parody conference), sets new mortgages.
