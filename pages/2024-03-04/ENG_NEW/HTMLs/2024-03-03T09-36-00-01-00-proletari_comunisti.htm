     spoke with three survivors to what has been called the 
 "Flour massacre", which led to the killing and injury of 
 Almost 1,000 Palestinians waiting for humanitarian aid.
     <br/>
     “We were surprised by the shots of the employment forces e 
 from the killing of dozens of people while we were waiting for aid 
 food ". This is what Jihad Rajab said, a survivor to 
 "Flour massacre", a
     <em>

    Of 
 Nabulsi, in the Sheikh Ajleen district, south-west of Gaza City, 
 while we were waiting for the trucks.
    <br/>
    Rajab, together with his cousin, went to the roundabout to wait for the 
 humanitarian trucks, with the hope of finally being able to get some 
  Flour.
    <br/>
    "For over two months my family has not tasted bread," Rajab told us, "for this reason we decided to go".
    <br/>
    “The trucks should have arrived on Wednesday. However, we have 
 Wait throughout the day and nothing has arrived. We have decided to 
 Sleeping there and waiting for the trucks, "he continued.

     "We were 
  Sitting on the beach and was very cold. But hunger was stronger 
 of anything else and thousands of people gathered there for 
 get food. In Gaza City there is nothing to eat and we live in 
  difficult conditions ”,
     <br/>
     “As soon as the trucks entered the area, the Israeli forces have 
 started shooting heavily, causing the killing and injury of 
 Dozens of people, "said Rajab.
     <br/>
     "The occupation did not spare us and has deliberately fired against 
  Of us while we were waiting for the aid convoy, "he added.
     <br/>
     “Despite my advanced age, I was lined up after a lot 
 cold, like all the residents of Gaza City, "said Hajj Mahmoud 
  Daghmash in The Palestine Chronicle.
     <br/>
     “We had been waiting for hours when we finally sighted the trucks. 
  At that moment, Israeli occupation opened fire against 
 We with shots and artillery bombings, "continued Daghmash.
     <br/>
     “Fear has filled all our hearts and people started 
 run anywhere. We didn't know where to hide. The screams of the wounded, 
 of women and children felt everywhere. "
     <br/>
     The occupation killed us twice, "Daghmas explained:" Once 
 When he bombed our homes, and then again making us die of 
 hunger".
     <br/>
     I can bear hunger, but my children and my family does not, and it is 
 extremely painful not to be able to provide for my children and mine 
 family". All the people in line only hoped to return from theirs 
  families with a lot of flour. Instead, over 100 people are back 
  Like martyrs and more than 800 they have returned as injured ".
     <br/>
     Daghmas explained that after more than a month the employment allowed 
 truck to enter and ranked the area of Sheikh Ajleen as the only one 
 corridor for aid.
     <br/>
     "This is a new war crime committed by the occupation against innocent civilians in the Gaza strip," he concluded.
     <br/>
     Yahya Salamia was also among the Palestinians waiting for humanitarian trucks 
  to Gaza City. It was particularly indignant when he realized 
  of how Israel has tried to distort the facts and to argue that i 
  Palestinians represented a threat to military vehicles.
     <br/>
     “We were all civil, unarmed. We just wanted to return to ours 
 Families with a lot of flour and a little food, "he told us.
     <br/>
     “Ben Gvir boasted the massacre and thanked the soldiers. This is 
  the biggest test that employment continues to commit a 
 genocide against the population of Gaza, "continued Salamia.
     <br/>
     "Occupation tries to deny the accusation of genocide to the Court 
 International justice, but every day he commits dozens of crimes e 
  works with all his strength to exterminate the population of Gaza e 
 displaced her from her lands ".

     Salamia 
  He also said the cameras have documented part of the massacre e 
  that the videos confirmed that Israel deliberately killed the 
 civilians while trying to get flour from the trucks.
     <br/>
     “Yes, I returned from my family healthy and Salvo and I escaped the 
 Death, but I was unable to provide them with food, "he said.
     <br/>
     “My heart suffers for all those who have been martyred and 
 injured in the massacre, and are deeply saddened because they are not 
 managed to provide food to my family ".
     <br/>
     Salamia asked the world to intervene to stop the crimes 
 Israelis and bring food to the population of Gaza, especially in 
 north.
     <br/>
     “We are starving every moment, and death from hunger is more painful 
  of death by bombing. The crying of children for hunger does not 
  Stop, and we have nothing to feed them. Save our children e 
 Stop the employment crimes against us ”.
