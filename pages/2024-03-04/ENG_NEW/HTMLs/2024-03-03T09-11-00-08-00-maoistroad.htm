 Georges Abdallah is not only a resistant; It is itself a symbol of the resistance and it is
 <br/>
 well for what the French state continues to keep it in prison despite the two decisions of
 <br/>
 justice authorizing his release. The cause of our comrade is intrinsically linked to our support for
 <br/>
 Palestine. That no action, initiative, gathering, demonstration happens without being chanted, displayed,
 <br/>
 written our requirement and in particular through this watchword which should never be truncated from its two
 <br/>
 Components: “Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Release Georges Abdallah! " - Because one was completely
 <br/>
 Given to his cause and the other cannot leave this torch of his resistance to the hands of the enemy. All those, in
 <br/>
 France and elsewhere, in solidarity with Palestine, must demand at every moment and wherever we are the
 <br/>
 Liberation of this fighter from the Palestinian Liberation Movement. And what better support can we
 <br/>
 Bring to the Palestinian resistance except by putting pressure on our own imperialism to tear off
 <br/>
 To this enemy one of his historic fighters!
 <br/>
 Since June 8, a new phase has opened up in this long battle that its support leads
 <br/>
 For his release: while mobilization, in the field, in the diversity of his expressions, continues to
 <br/>
 Amplifying, Georges Abdallah agreed to launch a new legal offensive by depositing a tenth
 <br/>
 Request for liberation-expulsion to its country Lebanon. Let us support by our actions the Georges approach
 <br/>
 Abdallah by making her resonate everywhere throughout the time of examining her new request and accentuons
 <br/>
 Always the pressure on the French state by our ever more increased mobilization and at all times!
 <span>
  <a name="more">
  </a>
 </span>
 <br/>
 It is in this sense and taking into account this new phase that we call once again to a month
 <br/>
 International actions for the release of Georges Abdallah from March 6 to April 6, 2024, - Date of the 14th
 <br/>
 demonstration in front of the Lannemezan penitentiary center. That during this time coordinated a thousand initiatives
 <br/>
 flourish everywhere in France and internationally for its release and there even for its solidarity fight
 <br/>
 With historical Palestine!
 <br/>
 Georges Abdallah is in prison for the political fight that has been his, for his positions and his ideals that he
 <br/>
 did not stop proclaiming and never denying. It is for his emancipation ideas that Georges Abdallah
 <br/>
 engaged in the struggle. It is for his ideas and resistance that he is still detained today. It's for his
 <br/>
 Ideas and its revolutionary fight that we support it and that we demand its release! For victory
 <br/>
 Or victory!
 <br/>
 Palestine live, live and defeat! Release Georges Abdallah!
 <br/>
 Let's continue the fight! Let's free Georges Abdallah!
 <br/>
 May a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish for his release!
 <br/>
 Honor to all those who fight for his release!
 <br/>
 It is together and only together, comrades, that we will defeat!
