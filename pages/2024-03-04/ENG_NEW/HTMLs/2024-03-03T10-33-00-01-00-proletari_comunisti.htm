  Therefore, the Yemenian army target a military boat

 Safety of navigation to merchant ships directed towards Suez.

 self defence. The aircraft was knocked down 6 kilometers away 
 from the boat, thanks to an equipment that can count on three 
 cannons, two machine guns, an anti -aircraft missile system, two 
 Lancies, two anti -Sommergible launches and a helicopter. The ship 
 military, present in the area since the beginning of February, took the place of the 
  Freate Martinengo who three weeks ago received the command 
 of the European operation Atalanta. Today's attack appears to be 
 Yet another of the challenge launched by the Houthi not only to Italy, but 
  to the whole of Europe. Duilio, in fact, will be the flagship that will command the fleet 
 of the other European mission, the Aspides, launched by Brussels on 19 
 last February and awaiting the parliamentary passage that will give 
 Officially the command to the Admiral Costantino. The first discussion 
  In the Senate he was scheduled for March 5th. yesterday yesterday the same premier Giorgia Meloni, during the meeting with 
  US President Joe Biden in the White House, he had defined 
 "Unacceptable" Houthi attacks by calling the Aspides mission 
 An "important European response" against the Houthi. Three days ago, 
 Instead, he had touched the German frigate "Hessen", also part of the 
  Aspides fleet, cope with an attack by the Houthi. For the first 
 time, also in this case, the boat had rejected two drones "in 
  Quick succession "directed to the frigate.

  "These 
 Attacks - Chiosa Crosetto - are part of a hybrid war, which uses
