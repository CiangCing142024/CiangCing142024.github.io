  Our comrades in the Filipino newspaper Ang Bayan, affiliated with the Filipine's Communist Party, report that the People's Army (New People's Army, NPA) has conducted a political-military training course. The purpose of the course is to arm those fighting with fundamental political military principles, in order to more efficiently withstand the Marco's regime's counter -revolutionary reprisal campaign. The exercise is also part of the guerrilla struggle to overcome ideological, political and organizational weaknesses that hinder the progress of the folk war, especially in the armed struggle, according to NPA in central Negro. "The exercise was successfully conducted because of the revolutionary cooperation between the battle and the commander, and the unwavering support from the masses for the unit's financial, financial and safety needs." says the device. The week -long training strengthened participants' determination and courage. "It's much better when practicing, because you don't fear meeting the enemy, especially considering that this is one of our core tasks as an army," says Ka Monique, a red fighting who participated in the exercise. Political-military exercises like this help "avoid the pure military position or to be militaristic .. To be good military is to be good at politics." Ended Ka Turko, squad leader and responsible for the exercise.
