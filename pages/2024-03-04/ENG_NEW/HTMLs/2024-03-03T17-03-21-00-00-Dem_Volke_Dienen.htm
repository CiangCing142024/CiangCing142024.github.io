  in Jena by around 10 percent. The Jena city council decided last Wednesday. Bü Mayor Christian Gerlitz (SPD) tried to talk this decision with the fact that the price increase did not affect 49 euro ticket users.

  On the night of last Thursday, the Jena city council agreed to increase the tariff of the Middle Dogen Transport Association (VMT). This is intended to increase the ticket price in Jena local transport by 9.97 percent. A single ticket then costs 2.70 euros instead of the previous 2.50 euros. A return trip costs 5.40 euros. Children's cards also become 10 cents more expensive and then cost 1.80 euros. Only last year in April there was an increase in driving prices by 7.78 percent. The subscription offers are also more expensive by around 10 percent.

According to Mayor Christian Gerlitz (SPD), 18,500 of the approximately 20,000 regular customers in the local public transport already have the 49 euro ticket, which affects only 1,500 public transport users directly from the increase.

  Until now only until May 2025 and the future of the 49 euro ticket is still uncertain, and price increases cannot be ruled out until then, Gerlitze's statement is only a cheap attempt to hunt down the price increase for the tickets.

  As a further "good reason", the mayor lists that the tariff increases "positive effects" on the reimbursement claims from the Germany ticket. The amounts that are reimbursed from the 49 euro ticket to local transport by the federal and state governments would increase by this increase. The costs are invited to the shoulders of the working class again.

  Much of public life in Jena takes place in the city center. People who live on the edge of the wide range and have no car must fall back on public transport. The high fees for local transport represent a hurdle for people, not only to get to work or school or university, but also to have part in the social life of the city. In Jena, for example, there is no free local transport for students and trainees.

  The financing of public transport is generally a political decision that cannot simply be waved with "There is too little money" because it is financed by public funds. A political decision by the rulers in this country, whether funds are used for the expansion and financing of public transport or for EU military operations and the rescue of "systematic banks".
