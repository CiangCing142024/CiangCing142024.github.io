   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The
 Question – and this a most pertinent question – on the minds of the 
Revolutionary Communists of Nepal is that of the conditions of Nepal: 
whether Nepal remains a semi-feudal society, with semi-feudal relations 
of production, or whether Nepal has been transformed into a capitalist 
society. Whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution has been completed 
or not. Whether the superstructure of society too has been transformed 
or whether the consciousness of the masses remains feudal or whether 
this has been sublated by a neoliberal consciousness that is found 
amongst the masses of the imperialist countries. The latter being just 
as essential in the analysis, since we understand consciousness to be a 
reflection of material reality, thus, a capitalist mindset would be 
indicative of a capitalist nature in society. This is the question that 
faces the revolutionaries of Nepal; it is necessary to have a correct 
stance on this issue
   </span>
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    .
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    It is 
necessary, first, to make clear what is meant exactly by the terms 
‘capitalism’ and ‘semi-feudalism’. After all, no such evaluation about 
the relations of production or the nature of society generally, can be 
conducted, without making clear what is meant by these terms. Firstly, 
it must be understood what is meant by capitalism, though a detailed 
analysis of the precise mechanisms of capitalism would take a 
dissertation of over a thousand pages (such a thing already exists, 
Capital); what capitalism is can be understood with a degree of 
exactitude without requiring such a dissertation. Capitalism is a mode 
of production and appropriation with the following characteristics:
   </span>

  <ol style="text-align: justify;">

     Private ownership over the means of production by the bourgeoisie

    </span>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Next, it
 is important to explain what semi-feudalism is, and how it differs from
 feudalism. To do this, it is necessary, first, to define feudalism. 
Feudalism is a mode of production and appropriation, just like 
capitalism, with the following characteristics:
   </span>
  </p>
  <ol style="text-align: justify;">
   <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Land ownership and thereby wealth in concentrated in the hands of a landlord class
    </span>
   </li>
   <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Means of Production are owned by a landless peasant class who work and live on the land, but do not own it
    </span>
   </li>
   <li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     The surplus produced by the peasants are paid to the landlord as rents
    </span>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Within a
 feudal society, the primary antagonism is that between the landlord 
class and peasant class, however, this is not the only antagonism. There
 also exist antagonisms between the landlord and nascent the 
bourgeoisie. The existence of this nascent bourgeoisie and a 
corresponding nascent class of wage laborers shows us how there exists 
the embryo of capitalist society within feudal society. Through 
successive processes of primitive accumulation and finally the hammer 
blow against feudalism – the bourgeois-democratic revolution – can this 
germ of capitalist society blossom and develop into mature capitalism. 
Semi-feudalism, thus, can be said to be the condition where the germ of 
capitalist society has undergone some development within feudal society;
 yet feudal conditions have not totally been swept away by the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution; where the landlord class still clings 
on to a great deal of power.

   <strong>
    General Development Out of Feudalism in Nepal:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In 
Nepal, until the 50s of the previous century, the laboring masses of 
peasants were crushed under the heel of the Rana Autocracy. This form 
however did not suit feudalism, and there existed a contradiction 
between the various feudal lords, particularly between the House of Shah
 and the House of Rana. The Ranas, to strengthen their position, made 
various agreements with the British Imperialists allowing for the flow 
of British finance capital to Nepal, this led to the birth of 
semi-colonial conditions in Nepal; where, Nepal maintained nominal 
independence but was effectively a colony of the British Imperialists. 
One instance of this is Clause 6 of the Nepal-Britain Treaty of 1923, 
which stated “
   </span>
   <i>
    <span style="font-weight: 400;">
     No Customs duty 
shall be levied at British Indian ports on goods imported on behalf of 
the Nepal Government for immediate transport to that country(…)
    </span>
   </i>
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    ”;
 this clause effectively allowed Britain to export British commodities 
and British finance capital to Nepal freely, and is one instance of the 
unequal treaties made by the feudal state. This is an early expression 
of the continued suppression of the Nepali National Bourgeoisie, as this
 treaty effectively allowed the British to outcompete Nepali enterprise 
and strengthen British monopoly finance capital.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Yet in 
the end, the British imperialists abandoned the Ranas and the 
contradictions between the landlords swiftly bubbled to the surface. 
These then finally erupted into a qualitative development in 1950. 
Where, one segment of the landlord class, represented by the House of 
Shah allied with the petite-bourgeoisie and haute bourgeoisie, 
represented by the Nepali Congress, along with the proletariat and 
peasants represented by the Nepali Communist Party; led a struggle 
against the more reactionary segment of the landlords led by the House 
of Rana. After the victory of this struggle, the landlord class had to 
make various concessions to the bourgeoisie, this led to a definite 
transformation of the conditions of Nepal from feudal to semi-feudal.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Some of 
these concessions, particularly political concessions made to the 
bourgeoisie, however, were chipped away by the landlord class. At this 
time, the landlords were the masters of this society, thus, Nepal was 
principally semi-feudal. The contradictions between the various aspects 
of society, but principally, the contradiction between the landlords and
 bourgeoisie, continued to deepen and intensify at this time. Many 
developments occurred during the subsequent decades. The condition of 
the Nepali Communist Movement became fractured and split. The two 
principal lines, the two banners carried by sections of the communist 
movement became: The banner of electoralism, parliamentarism and 
royalism upheld by those revisionists that would constitute the CPN 
(UML); the banner of revolution and smashing of the dictatorship of the 
compradors and landlords was upheld by those Marxists that would 
constitute the CPN (Maoist). The Revisionist Social Fascists then 
degenerated into the most stalwart defenders of the feudal system and 
the monarchy, the nucleus of this system.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In this 
period, the rising bourgeoisie, which could not unleash its productive 
potential under the dictatorship of the landlords, began to prepare by 
developing its strength and biding its time. In this time, the 
bourgeoisie were making preparations for their struggle with the feudal 
lords, they continued operating within the constricting semi-feudal 
relations imposed Panchayat system, which was the effective domination 
of the landlord classes, and their primacy. Nepal, at this time too, was
 both semi-feudal and semi-colonial, but the semi-feudal aspect was the 
principal oppression. However, the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie did 
not find this condition acceptable, and this led to a deepening of the 
contradictions between the two ruling classes.
    <span>
    </span>
   </span>
  </p>
  <a name="more">
  </a>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    This 
contradiction erupted into the “People’s Movement” of 1990, which was a 
struggle of the compradors against the landlords. The compradors 
temporarily allied themselves with the petite bourgeoisie, peasants, and
 proletariat against the landlords; the landlord class gave further 
concessions to the comprador bourgeoisie, leading to a more egalitarian 
division of power amongst the pre-existing class dictatorship. At this 
time, the landlords were still the principal aspect of the class 
dictatorship of the landlord and comprador/bureaucrat classes. The 
antagonism between the proletariat, peasants, petite bourgeoisie and 
national bourgeoisie on the one hand and the landlord, 
comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie on the other throughout this period 
sharply intensified. This intensification continued as the masses of 
people who trusted the comprador bourgeoisie to lead genuine change 
during the “People’s Movement” were promptly betrayed; as the ruling 
classes consolidated their own position and continued the wholesale 
exploitation of the oppressed classes. These developments and others led
 to a qualitative leap, a transformation made possible by the masses as 
the motive force of history, with their revolutionary wrath, being honed
 and strengthened by the revolutionary vanguard party. The revolution 
had begun.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The 
various successes and progressive developments made during the 
revolutionary period are far outside the scope of this piece. The main 
point, however, is that the New Democratic Revolution – the 
bourgeois-democratic and anti-imperialist revolution – was betrayed by 
the revisionists and renegades within the party. The New Democratic 
revolution was left incomplete, and the renegades fused the degenerated 
party with the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeois establishment. In this 
situation, can it be said that semi-feudalism was swept away? Can it be 
proclaimed, as some would wish to proclaim, that “The Revolution has 
eradicated semi-feudalism and established a democratic republic!” (the 
concept of “the democratic republic” being yet another revisionist 
daydream)? Absolutely not! The revolution was betrayed, stabbed in the 
back and the dreams of emancipation by the oppressed masses murdered by 
the revisionists and renegades, by those who have now developed Nepali 
Social Fascism to a new higher level (Prachanda Path). And without the 
revolution negating semi-feudalism, are we to believe that 
semi-feudalism eroded and died on its own? How can such a thing be when 
we understand struggle to be the basic motive force of history, without a
 violent eradication of semi-feudalism, without the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution, how can semi-feudalism simply vanish?! The reality is that 
semi-feudalism has not vanished, but rather its manifestation has simply
 transformed!
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The 
fusion of the renegades with the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie 
strengthened their position and caused a qualitative transformation in 
the nature of the Nepali State, previously, semi-feudalism had been the 
principal aspect, now, semi-colonialism became the principal aspect. 
With this weakening – though not eradication – of semi-feudalism, the 
landlord class took on a submissive role to the comprador/bureaucrat 
bourgeoisie. The hitherto open exploitation by the landlord class took 
on a covert character, and the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie took 
over the primary reins of the state. This however does not mean that the
 contradiction between the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie and the 
landlords has ended – far from it – the continual unity and struggle of 
these classes are what shapes Nepali society and the Nepali state. 
However, these classes are united in their exploitation of the oppressed
 classes, which is why it is necessary to smash their class dictatorship
 and establish a revolutionary state following the new democratic 
revolution.

  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <strong>
    Analysis of Present Conditions:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    With 
that established, however, it is nevertheless necessary to see how the 
objective conditions of Nepal to this day remain semi-feudal and how 
this may not always remain the case. The first development that is 
gradually eroding the semi-feudal conditions of Nepal is continued 
primitive accumulation. This process of primitive accumulation, what 
Marx compared to “original sin” is the first process which leads to the 
birth of mature capitalism from its embryonic state in the womb of 
feudalism. This embryonic capitalism in the womb of feudalism, has in 
the dependent nations been assimilated with imperialist monopoly finance
 capital, which in truth hinders the development of a national 
capitalism. The germ of mature national capitalism which has assimilated
 with imperialist monopoly finance capital has, through the process of 
primitive accumulation, synthesized itself into a higher stage of 
development; yet it is still in its embryonic stage within the soil of 
feudalism yet to germinate. However, to some extent, this process of 
germination has already commenced.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    For 
instance, during the process of primitive accumulation, it is known that
 due to the enclosure of land the hitherto landless yet not wholly 
desolate peasant class forcefully evicted from the lands where they had 
resided; is violently transformed into the industrial proletariat to 
meet the needs of the bourgeoisie. This mass proletarianization not 
merely meets the needs of the developing bourgeoisie of the urban 
centers, but also exceeds these demands, thus creating a reserve army of
 the proletariat. We are seeing precisely this process carry out in 
Nepal. Those that had hitherto lived as landless peasants or owners of 
small plots of land are being violently, due to various circumstances, 
forced out of their villages in droves. This process of 
proletarianization is proven by the mass urbanization experienced in 
Nepal, as people are being forced to migrate to cities in droves in 
search of jobs. Thus is created a new proletariat to meet the needs of 
this amalgam of monopoly finance capital and the germ of national 
capital. The peasants of Nepal are being transformed into an army of 
wage slaves to meet the needs of the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In spite
 of this, semi-feudal relations of production– between the peasants and 
landlords– remain prevalent. To this day, one and a half million 
households, are landless forced to live on the lands of landlords and 
work that land and pay rents to the landed aristocracy. To this day, the
 system of feudal oppression continues, though due to processes such as 
primitive accumulation, this feudal oppression is being sublated by a 
new, capitalist exploitation. This feudal oppression still continues, 
and millions continue to suffer under this system. The promise to 
redistribute land to the peasants have not been met by any of the 
so-called “Socialists” in power, for in truth their vacant words mean 
nothing. They, in the final analysis, represent the landlord class, and 
thus would not enact any policy or uphold any line that causes grievance
 to their landlord masters.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Thus, 
there is still a large class of peasants, and a class of landlords that 
oppresses these peasants. Hence, the primary antagonism of feudal 
society, the antagonism between the peasants and the landlord class, 
still exists and is still strong. This shows that the semi-feudal mode 
of production and appropriation still exists and still holds primacy in 
Nepali society.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Another 
important point of analysis is an analysis of the political and 
ideological superstructure. As materialists, we know that in the final 
analysis, the base shapes the superstructure; meaning that the 
structural and cultural hegemony of the ruling class would be reflected 
onto the superstructure on a micro and macro level. The individual is 
interpellated into a subject for and by ideology, to act as a reproducer
 of said ideology and participate in this ideology. It is through a 
sharp analysis of ideology, of the pure ideology that comprises the 
“common sense” looked on by society, that we can begin a dissection of 
the nature of the superstructure.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    To 
begin, it is necessary to look at the basic Ideological State 
Apparatuses which comprise the non-repressive aspect of the 
superstructure, namely: the family, education, and the media. The 
family, has, in recent decades, been transformed from an institution 
where relations in the family built on love, affection, and mutual 
compassion have been replaced by money-relations. Through this process –
 which is really a reflection of the aforementioned primitive 
accumulation and the rising primacy of monopoly finance capital 
reflected onto the sphere of culture and ideology (the superstructure) –
 it can be seen that the growth of capitalism is slowly leading to the 
decay of semi-feudal familial relations. An analysis of education must 
be divided into two questions, ‘who is doing the educating?’ and ‘what 
is being educated?’. The answer to the first question is the haute 
bourgeoisie: schools, colleges, and universities have become the domain 
of the haute bourgeois class; they have transformed education into a 
business-model operated by certain syndicates. This educational 
syndicate is precisely the natural result of market meddling in 
education. The answer to the second question is that ideology is being 
taught through education, ideology which conditions people not to 
question the status quo to blindly accept dictates from above; 
primarily, this is capitalist ideology. Lastly, the media is owned by 
the haute bourgeoisie and funded through advertisement by them. The 
media uses “credible” and “respected” bourgeois sources to shape the 
Overton window, such that radical ideas are wholly discredited and 
ruling class stances are brought to the fore.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    This may
 lead one to conclude that the superstructure is an apparatus through 
which the haute bourgeoisie exercise their hegemony and reproduce the 
ideology that justifies their hegemony, in turn reproducing capitalist 
relations of production. But this would be a hasty conclusion to draw! 
First, this bourgeois hegemony does not necessarily dispel the notion of
 Nepal being semi-feudal, since, this could be — and likely is — the 
result of the growing primacy of imperialist monopoly finance capital; 
this, by virtue of its nature has greater sway over the superstructure 
and is thus has a superior ability to reproduce itself. The imperialists
 and compradors have a greater ability to exert their hegemony through 
the superstructure by virtue of the resources they have at their 
disposal vis-à-vis the landlord class. So, this merely strengthens the 
assertion that Nepal is semi-colonial and does not dispel the assertion 
that it is semi-feudal! It is also undeniably true that internationally,
 due to their position as the primary superpower, the Yankee 
imperialists have been able to export their monopoly finance capital; 
this also invariably results in the export of Yankee idealist-liberal 
ideology and culture. This too is simply being manifested in Nepal.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Next, we
 understand the state to be the highest manifestation of the 
superstructure, and the state is the military-bureaucratic apparatus by 
which the ruling class enforces its class dictatorship. It is clear that
 this apparatus is still strongly in the pockets of the landlord class. 
In the military, many top generals and leader have served for the openly
 semi-feudal state led by the Shah Autocracy, and they continue to lead 
the military apparatus. Also, in the bureaucracy, many bureaucrats 
ranging from municipal secretaries to the top parties in parliament have
 a history of being in cahoots with the feudal autocracy. The parties, 
like the Nepali Congress and NCP (UML) have in the past acted as a 
shield deflecting the masses’ ire away from their oppression under the 
autocracy, and now they continue to do so covertly.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Lastly, 
in spite of the structural hegemony of the capitalists, the ideology, 
and consciousness of the people is still shaped by semi-feudalism. The 
demands for a return to monarchy, and a return to a more reactionary 
state of affairs, makes explicit the real semi-feudal conditions of 
society. After all, consciousness is shaped by material conditions, and 
semi-feudal consciousness suggests semi-feudal conditions.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <strong>
    Conclusion:
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In the 
final analysis, it is clear to see that Nepal is semi-feudal, 
semi-colonial in nature; semi-colonialism being the principal aspect. 
The seeming capitalist manifestations in Nepal are caused by the flow of
 monopoly finance capital to Nepal, and its assimilation with embryonic 
national capital; imperialist monopoly capital, like a leech, drains the
 vitality of the embryonic national capital of Nepal, hindering the 
development of a national capitalism. Imperialist monopoly finance 
capital is also in-bed with the national oppressors, mainly the landlord
 class. The seeming growth of capitalism in Nepal is an aberration from 
the laws of sociohistorical development; this is because the seeming 
growth of capitalism is actually the growth of a foreign born tumor: 
monopoly finance capital. Nepal remains largely semi-feudal, however, 
due to processes set in motion by this imperialist monopoly capital, the
 semi-feudal order is every day nearing its demise.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="font-weight: 400;">
    This 
intensifying contradiction between national capitalism on the one hand; 
and, semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism on the other; shall, through 
successive developments, lead to the inevitable qualitative leap forward
 of New Democratic Revolution. Feudalism feels threatened, which is why 
it retreats into greater reaction and chauvinism, as highlighted by the 
rise of Durga Prasai. Feudalism’s natural retreat into reaction shows 
how quantitative developments toward its abolition are being made in 
ever greater strides. Revolution is inevitable.
