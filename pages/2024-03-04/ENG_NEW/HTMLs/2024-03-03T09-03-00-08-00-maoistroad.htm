      <p>
       After taking the sky by assault, Krupskaya did a great job 
 organizer, political and pedagogical; She was appointed attached to the commissioner 
 of the people (minister) of public instruction; was in charge of 
 Adult Education Department. For many years he prepared the 
 pedagogical aspects of the new education system, because the task was, 
 as she said: «Destroy the old class class that 
 He behaved scandalous injustices, and create a school that responded 
  to the needs (...) of the recent socialist regime », hence the 
 organization of education became a task of the entire 
 People: Popular Education Councils were created everywhere and in 
 Schools organized students 'parents' committees. And to the 
 Masters Comrade Krupskaya told them: «The popular teacher is more 
 Near the popular environment and, in many cases, it is linked to that medium by 
  thousands of ties; the dividing line between the teaching profession and the 
 People had drawn artificially with a specific objective. The 
  new conditions are suppressing this division and you have to create 
 modalities of collaboration between teachers and the population, which 
 put an end to this antinatural division (…). In this approach is the 
  School prosperity guarantee, which increases the cultural level 
  of the country thanks to everyone's intense work, and a better future; the 
 Promise of the Renaissance of the Magisterium whose function can now be 
 honorable and respected ».
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to all this, Krupskaya was editor of the magazine
       <em>
        Towards a new life
       </em>
       ; 
  And for those years she was elected delegate to all the congresses of the party, 
  member of its guiding bodies and deputy in the main bodies 
 power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comrade Krupskaya was also a great promoter of the 
 Libraries, in 1918, thanks to his initiative the first one was created 
 Seminar of the Soviet Library in Moscow, more than 20 were opened 
 Library departments in Russian education institutes 
 Politics, Pedagogy Institutes and in the Academies of Education 
 Communist. Krupskaya considered literacy and access to 
 Books as instruments in the socialist struggle, so he fought because 
 Budgets for libraries will be increased 
 public, however, due to lack of budget, the only 
 solution was that the private collections of more than 500 copies 
 were confiscated, nationalized and stored in the new 
 Libraries, the individual property of books became collective.

      <p>
       Krupskaya was also convinced that: «We cannot continue 
 developing economically and culturally without ending the 
 darkness of illiteracy », so the department of 
 population literacy from which various 
 Measures: In 1919 a decree law was issued on the eradication of 
 population illiteracy from 8 to 50 years, in 1920 the 
 Extraordinary National Commission for the eradication of illiteracy, 
  In 1923 the voluntary society was created below illiteracy, with the 
 "Alphabets, instruct the illiterates!", In 1925 it began to 
  apply general, free and mandatory primary education; In 1928 
 Books were published in 70 languages from the peoples of the USSR, and in 1934 in 
  104 languages. Thus, although at the beginning of the twentieth century, almost 80 % of the 
 Russian population (between 8 and 50 years old) was illiterate and 60 % of the 
 population had not completed basic education, for 1930 that percentage 
  had decreased to 33 %, the revolution created education centers for 
 All levels and - between 1920 and 1940 - he managed to literate 60 million 
  Adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1918 he published the article
       <em>
        On the question of the Socialist School
       </em>
       , 
  in which he pointed out the sense of socialist education: «Form 
 Multilaterally developed people, with social predispositions 
 conscious and organized, that have a vision of the reflexive world, 
 integral and that clearly understand everything that is happening to their 
 around nature and social life; people prepared in 
 Theory and practice for all types of work, both physical 
  as mental; people capable of building a rational social life, 
 Full of content, beautiful and cheerful. These people are necessary to 
 Socialist society, without them socialism cannot be done 
 fully ».
      </p>
      <p>
       Krupskaya wrote more than 3000 publications among books, 
 magazines, articles and pamphlets, especially about the formation of the 
  Youth and communist education that should be secular, universal, 
 free and mandatory for all, include both sexes, with a 
 democratic organization where there was a wide participation of the 
 population in the election of school committees, with full freedom of 
  opinion and with the right to receive education in your native language.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1919, Krupskaya, along with other comrades, created the
       <em>
        Jenotdel
       </em>
       , 
  an apartment that worked to improve the living conditions of 
 women in the educational field, in their rights in marriage and 
 at work. From this organization the publication of the 
 Feminist newspaper
       <em>
        Communist
       </em>
       , where it was written about the situation of women and their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        Jenotdel
       </em>
       And his press allowed the first years 
 After the Russian revolution, they witness the great achievements in 
 issues such as sexual diversity and women's rights. 
 Before the revolution, according to Kupskaya's words: «Family life 
 It was based on slavery: children were owned by parents, and 
  Woman, from the husband », but that situation surpassed the laws that 
 Soviet legislation established: the punishment of the 
 homosexuality, women had the right to vote and to be candidates, 
  The right to divorce was automatically facilitated and granted, there were 
 access to universal and free education, equal salary between men and 
  Women, aid to relieve family burdens and abortion right 
 free and free, it was established that sons and daughters inside or outside 
  marriage had the same rights, the permit of 
 maternity, more rights were granted to women at work and 
  established the equality of the spouses in relation to the children and 
 daughters. Surprising achievements for the time and that constituted a great 
 progress in the struggle of the female movement.

      <p>
       For Krupskaya, the long hours of women of women in the 
 Factory had as its main consequence that many boys and girls 
 They grow in the streets, and in some cases, mothers, without capacity 
 No time to educate them, they decided to intern their children in orphanages. 
 It was necessary to end the exploitation of working women and that 
 The society guarantees the education and food of childhood. By 
 This created childhood gardens that would allow women to go to 
 work with the certainty that their children would be very careful and 
 fed In addition, the education that children would receive in the 
  Public School would take the importance of work as a basis 
 productive, creative and multilateral.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Lenin's death, which occurred in 1924, Krupskaya dedicated great 
 Part of his time to edit the work of his late husband. By 
 importance that the comrade had in the preparation and execution of the 
 Proletarian revolution, for his work in favor of socialism, were 
 granted several distinctions: in 1929, the red flag of work; in 
 1931, was appointed honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the 
 USSR and, in 1933, Lenin's order was granted. In 1933 he published his 
 book of Memories
       <em>
        My life with Lenin
       </em>
       And since 1937, Krupskaya was a member of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
      </p>
      <p>
       On February 27, 1939, he died in Moscow, the day after 
 have turned 70. His ashes were deposited with Lenin 
  In his mausoleum and Comrade Stalin presided over his burial. The achievements 
 outstanding in the field of literacy led to the fact that, in 
 1970, the Unesco imperialist will appoint Nadezhda Krupskaya to her prize 
 Annual to merit in the fight against illiteracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thought and actions of communist women of such 
 from Nadezhda Constantínovna Kruupskaya marked true milestones in the 
 Historical struggle of the female labor movement. The best tribute to him 
  We can give to the comrade is the application of their ideas, its fight in 
  around the female movement and for a public education and quality 
 for the people. In their tribute today women continue to march for 
  the organization of the revolutionary party in all countries and by the 
  Construction of the Communist International, which leads to the proletariat 
 World to take from the sky by assault.
