  While the state of Israel continues to develop its genocide against the Palestinian people, the official death toll for Palestinians has killed by Israel in Gaza
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/29/1234159514">

  , that more than 25,000 women and children have been killed in Gaza by Israel since October 7.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  On Thursday, February 29, the state of Israel committed a special cynical act. At least 112 Palestinians waiting for help were
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/flour-massacre-how-gaza-food-killings-unfolded-and-israels-story-changed">
   massacre
  </a>
  by IDF. More than 750 people were injured. Thousands of people who desperately needed food, water and medicine gathered early in the morning, waiting for Harun Al-Rashid street in northern Gaza, where it was thought trucks with flour were on the way. When the trucks arrived, IDF began shooting at the assembled civilians with all kinds of military equipment. When people returned to the trucks after the first round of shooting was over, the Israelis opened fire again. A journalist on the spot reported that "after opening fire, Israeli tanks advanced and drove over many of the dead and wounded bodies."
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  A witness describes what happened: “We had come here to get some help. I've been waiting since noon yesterday. Around. 4.30 Early in the morning, the trucks began to seep in. The Israelis just opened random fire to us, as if it were a trap. As we approached the relief trucks, the Israeli tanks and war plans began shooting at us. "Another person on the spot said," We should bring flour ... Then Israeli snipers shot at us. "
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  IDF first tried to blame the victims by saying that most deaths were due to panicked people trampling at each other when the trucks arrived. Witnesses describe that it only happened after the Israeli soldiers opened fire. IDF later changed their story and claimed they opened fire because the assembled people were a threat to them.

<strong>
   District cancer, March 3, 2024:
  </strong>
  A police constable was killed killed in a skirmish with a squad of armed cadres of the CPI (Maoist) in Chhattisgarh’s Kanker district on Sunday, a senior police official announced to the press today.
 </p>
<p>
  The firefight took place in a forest near Hidur village under Chhotebethiya police station when a joint team of security personnel was out on an anti-Maoist operation, the official declared.
 </p>
<p>
  The operation was launched based on a specific intelligence input about the presence of Maoists in the Hidur forest, the official remarked.
 </p>
<p>
  Constable Ramesh Kurethi, belonging to Bastar Fighters, (a unit of the state police), was killed in the gun battle, the official commented.
 </p>
<p>
  The body of a Maoist and an AK-47 rifle were also recovered from the site of the encounter, the official said, adding that a search operation was underway in the area.

  Our comrades in the Filipino newspaper Ang Bayan, affiliated with the Filipine's Communist Party, report that the People's Army (New People's Army, NPA) has conducted a political-military training course. The purpose of the course is to arm those fighting with fundamental political military principles, in order to more efficiently withstand the Marco's regime's counter -revolutionary reprisal campaign. The exercise is also part of the guerrilla struggle to overcome ideological, political and organizational weaknesses that hinder the progress of the folk war, especially in the armed struggle, according to NPA in central Negro. "The exercise was successfully conducted because of the revolutionary cooperation between the battle and the commander, and the unwavering support from the masses for the unit's financial, financial and safety needs." says the device. The week -long training strengthened participants' determination and courage. "It's much better when practicing, because you don't fear meeting the enemy, especially considering that this is one of our core tasks as an army," says Ka Monique, a red fighting who participated in the exercise. Political-military exercises like this help "avoid the pure military position or to be militaristic .. To be good military is to be good at politics." Ended Ka Turko, squad leader and responsible for the exercise.

 "From front (conflicting attitude) did not fit, from behind (submission to the system) swimming." A paraphrase of an exhausted old punch, which burns unjustly aspects of a remarkable rural uprising against the strategic targeting of the capitalist staff for the outbreak? Or to be a vulgar methodology of subversive forces against the calculative, multi -day mobilizations of the poor farm?
 <br>
<br>
 On one side of the half -plain plain because of accuracy of agrarian and fuel, degrading prices on the products, farming CAP, a tskromomas, tax, bad weather, the indignation of the pinking hands is wildly sailed. Opposite to her, the armors are shaken as lobster steering wheel in the country, following a completely fair behavior. Do not make the slightest distinction. That is to say, the relentless attack on all the strata of those who are struggling to secure a honest manner in a honest manner, stress, anxiety, fear of physical army or loser of life itself (labor murders, crimes in temporis, waterfalls).
 <span>
<a name="more">

<br>
<br>
 But at some distance a few years of light beyond, right there in the small flock of blue -blooded giggling, the landscape is shifting. At that time, the bottom of the barrel of poverty that torments the social majority is frantically scratched and any harvesting is heading for the overflowing of the golden scum of the legal mafia of the aristocrats. By magic, the budgetary space (miserable wording of the people's looting) is expanding wasteful for the sake of the dominant parasitic order.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Infinite affection for capital and no compassion for the plagues. Let his child be starving and let his child be unable to pay the cost of studies in public (and under the abolition of free) universities. Every patient has to respond to the excruciating dilemma, if paying afternoon surgeries and being heal will then die of hunger or vice versa. Unless luxury exists for both. It was out of work and kneeling from the black -haired accuracy, continued, we were breathing, to sigh in the arena of exploitation by completing the coins of the pension.
 <br/>
<br/>
 On the contrary, all the previous sacrifices of the below and for the good of the "development of the place" must be transformed into profitability, mythical vigor and investment privileges of the bourgeoisie. Also - especially in our time - in dizzying costs of supplying torsion disaster (here instead of barrels, we find lakes full of sweaty workers) and participation in war adventures of the planet's chiefs. Probably the interests of the biomass are so distant and huge that they not only touch the EEZs, but by "engaging" with those shipowners, industrialists and bankers (those with household evictions) travel to the Red Sea or Ukraine. Thus serving the neo -Nazis Zionists and American imperialists and contributing to the bloodshed of the Palestinian resistance against the usurpers of the land !!
 <br/>
<br/>
 So in this rule of the misery of the masses (and the prosperity of the bosses) there is no exception. Not even for those who feed the population producing tedious wheat, fruit and vegetables and oil. The farmer in the name of concentration (neo -pilgrims), supplying the agro -industrial sector with cheap raw material and harmonization with European orders must simply be erased. Always perforated excuses and green unkinds.
 <br/>
<br/>
 So the one -way street of the farmers' struggle was again hunting for their prosperity, but seeking anxiously the viable stay in the fields. Despite this, the curtain of this year's significant controversy of modern collapse with the government has fallen for many, in a row. The prime minister's epitheliums are silently in order not to cause (no substantial retreat), triumphantly. On the part of the farmers again, the classic, stupid juniors of a success-related success of the problem (did we ignore it?), Achievement of social acceptance-sympathy, partnership with other European colleagues.
 <br/>
<br/>
 What were these and how radical or threatening were there for the implementation of anti -grocery plans? Better let the official and non -enthusiasts of the enemies of the people comment.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The preacher of the gang of the exploitation-exhaustion-ragation of Proderdis from the television pulpit sends the Sycharics to its organizers (and) a motorized "long course" from the country's dying to its heart, the Constitution. Something dirty probably smells of guidance, when a sworn warrior of social majority rights praises. Mostly when Mitsotakis receives the baton of the begging, applauding (instead of being) the "prudent" manipulations at all stages for weeks of mobilization.
 <br/>
<br/>
 And how not to reward the attitude of the fronts, when the exclusions of national roads - despite the line -up of hundreds of tractors at their edges and the tired of base dissatisfaction - were minimal and time from ten minutes to the very two -hour (usually for trucks) . Such parody forms of action, even centuries, would not have a trace of pressure on the makers. Symbolic theatricals against a scent, sweeping outing.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the other, the president of the Attica Police Officers' Association is not flattering to the heads of all protests for excellent cooperation with the authorities (and so -called electoral left of the capitulation of the "Children of the People", who "randomly and detailed" tears) with the aim of limiting the upheaval of the residents of Athens and a short -circuit of the smooth functioning of the Teratoupolis.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Indeed, the "prestigious" farm is taking off the climate of mutual abundance, calling for police protection of the rally from possible slander of turbulent circles within the peaceful body of the protesters !! The real -minded images where the Mattzis were piercing tractors or welcomed the "invaders" farmers with beatings and chemicals in the Piraeus port, as well as various other similar civil war, now belong to the immediate past. Perhaps the uninterrupted accompaniment of tractors with patrols all the way to the national roads and in their one lane "of course" (so as not to suffer the otherwise carefree, charged people) to have the character of a class solidarity.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Also heard in the misinformation and disintegration newsletters (and most likely would apply) that it was requested (and was it given?) Named list of tractors for disciplines !! Pity. This "anti -labor" perception leads the employees of the unemployment mechanisms.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It was also rumored that the prime minister was swinging by the dilemma to the concentration by the last minute, expressing a full understanding of the serious difficulties of the primary sector. Eventually, however, it was limited to the long -term expression of sympathy for their justified reactions, but also to the clear reluctance of baking from demands, beyond the original crumbs. Fortunately, the gap was overwhelmed by the presence of other politicians and tested, fiery therapists (such as SYRIZA) of the EU Agrotheraki.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the past, the state -owned rage, prosecutors and threats, arrests and agricultural courts, orgy muddle of silver journalists, accusations of political motivation, activation of social automation. Nowadays and in the initial phase, such practices have definitely mediated, but to a milder degree. Regardless of the well-known rails of the representatives of the peasantry, the aura of a non-electrified atmosphere between the two camps (government-peasants) were passed by, since the carrot was honored. Raising the reasonable question about the mysterious and somewhere in the superb origin of the causes of malice (poverty and extrusion in abandonment of this particular livelihood) for the mass of farmers. Or at least focusing it on the evil Cup and to God on the old never -ending core of the non -guilty (probably?) EU.
 <br/>
<br/>
 So we came to the time of the so -called crown and essentially ending racing actions. Such a climax, as much as similar determination, distinguished them in the past. Massively inconsistent (despite the widespread rage of farmers) of critical problems of producers and universal awareness that is no longer the improvement of the very meager income, but the inability of crops itself.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In forms of fighting almost velvet (the modernist introduced by the "pioneer"), bullshit and repeated from the guilty past of the conciliation. So completely powerless in blackmailing an unfaithful, cruel opponent. That is, they were the short blocks. Instead of cutting Greece in the middle, only the race was fragmented and degenerated. The note of the two -sided and deliberately uncoordinated with others with perseverance in the battle of the bishopric of the people of the people (students). A confrontation with supportive supportive and timely strike initiatives of the supposedly allies. Even the non -interconnection of agricultural problems with the anti -war (each feather of the F35 and the shipment of frigates what amounts to ELGA?) Was negative.
 <br/>
<br/>
 So the escalation (deciphering the vocabulary of reformism constitutes an alibi-trick of the definitive resignation) has performed its destination as the figure of the figure of the finishing sale. He was registered in the rich story of the relief of anger and racing momentum. The need for non -poverty and survival pushes in the arena of the struggles, and the captains, if they honor their role, consistently justify them. Otherwise if they are epileptic, they lead them to the rocks of defeat and subsequent inactivation.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The blocks were reflected the adverse associations for the people, and the dynamics of the farmers to overthrow their choices by the means of the firefighters' efforts of the movement for unconditional submission. Certainly the explosiveness of the problems, its awareness of developments in combination with the encouragement - encouragement from the impressive stream of the upheaval of their colleagues in the various European primates, influenced the formation of a - relatively - right -wing. On the other hand, the chronic deconstruction and lag behind the resistance of the people, the partial unmistakation of the power of the punch, the self -evident suspicion towards trade unions.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Obviously the unpleasant ending of the race was not discounted. Unexpected, dirty and at the same time rough the duties of dying by the captains of a confrontation in conditions of savage attack on income and the transparent risk of extinction. In any confrontation, even folding, reaps the gain of experience - the restaurant and the reconstitution - return to the ramparts under more favorable conditions. In addition, the cost of a defeat becomes more painful if it leaves the aftertaste of an immune antiseptic and a frustrating - paralyzing impatience to be treated again with a higher organization.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But the veil up to the most ineffective crash has positive slits. Much more in the case where its causes are focused not on inadequate participation and non -vigorous minds, but on catalytic (and solvent) intervention within the lines of struggling forces adjacent (and worshiped) in the system. Therefore, their unblocking facilitates the reduction of the influence of such harmful factors in the future. Of course the gap (which is not automatically replaced and in the midst of inaction) of the navigation of the next racing outbursts must necessarily be covered by uncommon communist elements, focused on the goal of awakening, recruiting and exhaustion (something that did not happen now) a persistent and uninterrupted orbit. Then, even a possible failure will be fertile, as it will pregnancy the successive victorious raid away from the perpetual cycle of undermined, ineffective attempts.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Only the resolution of the problems of the peasantry will bring about its appeasement. With guarantors of the state, its respective managers and the EU, they will certainly worsen unbearable. At the same time, they are unintentionally guaranteed (and unfortunately for them) the submarine of the later uprising. Reconstruction of the first vital cells of the organization of the current declined agricultural associations, restoring the agricultural movement in solid, non -negotiable foundations and despising the reformist sirens of the conciliation after the end of the struggles, the farmers will not return.
 <br/>
<br/>
 For lucrative crops in the field, they must register with satisfactory crop in the mesters of claims. For remarkable crops in the races, they have to avoid the devastating traps of the nightmares that guard them. To get angry and revolted, they don't have to do anything. The opponents take care of this with unmistakable study.

 It may be late for months, but, in his first public position - at the Kathimerini Symposium, please - put things in their "position". He "apologized" for the cases of broadcasting licenses and Novartis, saying that "there were no proper handling"! And that cost the election to SYRIZA. The hint was clear: he should not have "put it" with the media of the media and the drug. Opera -rewarding means that he had to have made even a right turn since then!
 <br>
<br>
 He never raised the issue of exit the country from the eurozone, which had repeatedly clarified the President of the Republic. Varoufakis and SIA were probably acting ... Autonomous and deserted by the Prime Minister! Perhaps the ruling class that did not "negotiate" (the way it is said) how much its imperialist patrons would degrade it. 'Or maybe not;
 <br>
<br>
 If these "mistakes" had not been made and the system of power inside and outside the country would remain "clean" and the bipartisanship would be long before today. Probably his party.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Tsipras "Capital" (so we were told about SYRIZA executives as the recent parody conference), sets new mortgages. It is present in the right shift of the already right political scene. The point, however, is that Kasselakis has already caught it!

<p>
  The Zionist aggression war against the Palestinian people has victimized over 30,000 Palestinians and has left over 70,000 injured since October 7, 2023, including a huge amount of women and children. In Brazil, agents and assiduous supporters of Zionism has been freely acting, and since last year have raised their propaganda actions of the Israeli regime and attack on personalities who rise in defense of the Palestinian people and their authentic national resistance. Nevertheless, and despite the diplomatic tremors of recent weeks, the Brazilian government and state continue to maintain deep relations with the Israeli regime. For many Brazilians, the answer to this question remains pending: because Lula, despite recognizing the apartheid regime of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian people and even that Zionist aggression is comparable to the Holocaust, instead in the maintenance of economic relations , military and policies with the state of Israel?
 </p>
<p>
  The honest answer to this question is precisely in identifying these relationships, and above all which sectors of the country benefit from them.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Weapons and tanks against the Brazilian people…
 </h4>
<p>
  Starting with the reactionary armed forces. Brazil is one of the main buyers of Israeli military technology and training. Some cases reveal the magnitude of contracts: In 2016, the Navy spent R $ 75 million in the purchase of communication equipment, combat cars and actions for the development and renewal of operating systems. The following year, the reactionary army spent R $ 6.3 billion on imported armored armor of Israel. Aeronautics does not escape the rule: the force has already made at least 65 payments for IAI, company
  <strong>
   state
  </strong>
  Israeli.
 </p>
<p>
  The list could continue for a long time:
 </p>
<p>
  In October 2023, the House of Representatives approved a Security Cooperation Agreement between Brazil and Israel, with a forecast of collaboration in research and police intelligence, security in the use of information technology and communications, governance practices in crisis and emergency situations , industry, technologies and services applied to public safety, criminal and forensic analysis, among others.
 </p>
<p>
  During the 2013-2014 protest journeys, a contract of R $ 102.6 million was sealed for the purchase of drones.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same period, 1.13% of GDP was intended for the modernization of the armed forces with Israeli equipment.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli International Security company, Defense Systems (ISDS) has already conducted training from the RJ PM Special Operations Battalion (BOPE), “Elite Troop” responsible for the main chacinas in Rio de Janeiro favelas.
 </p>
<p>
  In the last century, the Brazilian state already bought items from AEL Sistemas Ltda., A Brazilian subsidiary of Elbit founded in Brazil in 1982, during the military regime. In addition to AEL, Elbit also owns the “Brazilian” military companies aerospace and save sa.
 </p>
<p>
  No wonder, the Brazilian reactionary military soon spoke, even if hidden, when the diplomatic relations between Brazil and Israel were shudder. On February 19, CNN announced that the "army sees with worry of wear between Brazil and Israel." According to the communication monopoly, members of the Military Force were consulted for the report, perhaps used as a means of warning from the government to the government.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  … Soy and ox to Israel
 </h4>
<p>
  Apart from the barracks, the sector that benefits the most from relations with Zionism is the Brazilian landlord. From exports from Brazil to Israel, the three main groups were: “crude oil or bituminous minerals raw” (21%), “fresh beef” (19%) and “soy” (18%). That is, 37% (soy and beef) were directly to the benefit of the landlord. The others favored the large mining companies and the tycoons that enrich the sale of Brazilian oil abroad. Brazil also exports coffee and orange juice to Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same line, among the most imported products by Brazil in Israel are the inputs of the chemical industry. By 2023, 45% of the Zionist state imports were chemical fertilizers and fertilizers, worth $ 608 million ($ 3 trillion). Another 11% were insecticides ($ 144 million, or $ 713.4 million).
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  No impact on the economy
 </h4>
<p>
  If Brazil broke relations with Israel, the economic impact on the people would be small. Sales of Brazilian products to Tel Aviv do not benefit the nation as a whole, as profits are built by landowners and the state does not even benefit from tax collection, given the millionaire tax exemptions to the sector.
 </p>
<p>
  Even considered sales that benefit only agribusiness, Israel was still the 54th largest destination of Brazilian products in 2023. The income of negotiations was only 0.19% of everything that was exported by Brazil.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Everything comes down to commitment
 </h4>
<p>
  Relationships are not broken, therefore, for the sake of commitment. For fears of the consequences of fright with the barracks after the 2022 institutional rupture, Lula is currently more committed to the military (or rather submissive) than in any other government of his.
 </p>
<p>
  The year 2023 was marked, in addition to the various political nods to the military summit, by the government's exorbitant incentives to the “defense” area. Only the Growth Acceleration Project (PAC), one of the government's windows,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/exercito-desenvolve-projetos-para-combate-ao-inimigo-interno/">
   will allocate R $ 12.4 billion to the Army
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The commitment relationship also extends to the landlord. Last year, the Brazilian agent destined
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/plano-safra-luiz-inacio-anuncia-agrado-ao-latifundio-com-recorde-de-verbas/">
   R $ 332 billion to agribusiness through the “Safra Plan”
  </a>
  , in addition to credits through other programs such as the
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/governo-segue-com-gastos-recordes-com-agro-e-fornece-mais-r-6-bilhoes-ao-latifundio/">
   Rural BNDES
  </a>
  . Also in order not to create friction, the agrarian reform was paralyzed, and no hands of land was bought by the government.
 </p>
<p>
  And as Lula knows that the total break with Israel (that is, from diplomatic, military and economic relations) would be a source of severe displeasure to these sectors, the theme is also avoided.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Far-right
 </h4>
<p>
  In this scenario, the agents of Zionism take the opportunity to act freely in Brazilian lands. Without serious confrontation by the government to Zionism and the far right (with whom the government prefers to maintain a composition policy, not coping), agencies such as the Israeli Confederation of Brazil (Conib), ascending in Brazil since the years From the Bolsonaro government, they persecute without restrictions personalities such as progressive journalist Breno Altman. Altman was chased after publishing
  <em>
   tweets
  </em>
  in support of the Palestinian people and their resistance. Of Jewish origin, it was accused by the Conib of Anti -Semitism.
 </p>
<p>
  In the official political sphere, the City of Rio de Janeiro
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/sionistas-pressionam-prefeitura-do-rj-a-criminalizar-manifestacoes-de-apoio-a-palestina/">
   adopted the terms of “antisemitism” proposed by Zionist organizations
  </a>
  as the International Alliance of Holocaust Memory (IHRA), the NGO
  <em>
   Standwiths
  </em>
  Brazil, the Israeli Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro and Conib itself. According to Ihra, it would be anti -Semitic to say that "the existence of the state of Israel is a racist enterprise." The municipal management of São Paulo has also been, since November last year, to adopt the definition of IHRA.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, governors such as Goiano Ronaldo Caiado, notorious Latifundist-policeman, take advantage of the maintenance of advertising relationships to seal
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/go-governador-inaugura-parque-em-homenagem-a-israel-e-faz-acordos-com-estado-sionista/">
   New agreements with Israel
  </a>
  and shake the Sionism flag. Last week, Caiado closed two new agreements with Israel, one to combat "anti -Semitism" and one of stimulating "agribusiness". The governor also inaugurated the park “AM Israel Chai”, where 1,200 units of the traditional Palestinian tree will be planted, Oliveira, in honor of the people killed in Israel on October 7th. The park monument does not mention the Palestinian people and points Hamas as a “terrorist group” responsible for all the deaths of that day, ignoring the Israelis killed by the army of their own state.
 </p>
<p>
  On the part of the Brazilian people, follow the requirements of disruption of total relations with Israel. Pro-Palestinian manifestations often occur to condemn the propaganders and financiers of Zionism, as recorded in recent protests in front of the
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/mg-protesto-na-frente-da-globo-denuncia-cumplicidade-dos-monopolios-de-imprensa-com-o-genocidio-palestino/">
   headquarters of Rede Globo de Televisão,
  </a>
  in Belo Horizonte (MG), and in
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-manifestantes-queimam-bandeiras-ianque-e-sionistas-e-atacam-consulado-do-usa-em-protesto-pro-palestina/">
   American embassy
  </a>
  em Recife (PE).
 </p>
<p>
  But among the wide popular masses and the ruling classes attached to Israel, the government has already chosen with those who prefer to maintain a good neighborhood commitment and policy.

 pedagogical aspects of the new education system, because the task was, 
 as she said: «Destroy the old class class that 
 He behaved scandalous injustices, and create a school that responded 
  to the needs (...) of the recent socialist regime », hence the 
 organization of education became a task of the entire 
 People: Popular Education Councils were created everywhere and in 
 Schools organized students 'parents' committees. And to the 
 Masters Comrade Krupskaya told them: «The popular teacher is more 
 Near the popular environment and, in many cases, it is linked to that medium by 
  thousands of ties; the dividing line between the teaching profession and the 
 People had drawn artificially with a specific objective. The 
  new conditions are suppressing this division and you have to create 
 modalities of collaboration between teachers and the population, which 
 put an end to this antinatural division (…). In this approach is the 
  School prosperity guarantee, which increases the cultural level 
  of the country thanks to everyone's intense work, and a better future; the 
 Promise of the Renaissance of the Magisterium whose function can now be 
 honorable and respected ».
      </p>
<p>
       In addition to all this, Krupskaya was editor of the magazine
       <em>
        Towards a new life
       </em>
       ; 
  And for those years she was elected delegate to all the congresses of the party, 
  member of its guiding bodies and deputy in the main bodies 
 power.
      </p>
<p>
       Comrade Krupskaya was also a great promoter of the 
 Libraries, in 1918, thanks to his initiative the first one was created 
 Seminar of the Soviet Library in Moscow, more than 20 were opened 
 Library departments in Russian education institutes 
 Politics, Pedagogy Institutes and in the Academies of Education 
 Communist. Krupskaya considered literacy and access to 
 Books as instruments in the socialist struggle, so he fought because 
 Budgets for libraries will be increased 
 public, however, due to lack of budget, the only 
 solution was that the private collections of more than 500 copies 
 were confiscated, nationalized and stored in the new 
 Libraries, the individual property of books became collective.

<p>
       Krupskaya was also convinced that: «We cannot continue 
 developing economically and culturally without ending the 
 darkness of illiteracy », so the department of 
 population literacy from which various 
 Measures: In 1919 a decree law was issued on the eradication of 
 population illiteracy from 8 to 50 years, in 1920 the 
 Extraordinary National Commission for the eradication of illiteracy, 
  In 1923 the voluntary society was created below illiteracy, with the 
 "Alphabets, instruct the illiterates!", In 1925 it began to 
  apply general, free and mandatory primary education; In 1928 
 Books were published in 70 languages from the peoples of the USSR, and in 1934 in 
  104 languages. Thus, although at the beginning of the twentieth century, almost 80 % of the 
 Russian population (between 8 and 50 years old) was illiterate and 60 % of the 
 population had not completed basic education, for 1930 that percentage 
  had decreased to 33 %, the revolution created education centers for 
 All levels and - between 1920 and 1940 - he managed to literate 60 million 
  Adults.
      </p>
<p>
       In 1918 he published the article
       <em>
        On the question of the Socialist School
       </em>
       , 
  in which he pointed out the sense of socialist education: «Form 
 Multilaterally developed people, with social predispositions 
 conscious and organized, that have a vision of the reflexive world, 
 integral and that clearly understand everything that is happening to their 
 around nature and social life; people prepared in 
 Theory and practice for all types of work, both physical 
  as mental; people capable of building a rational social life, 
 Full of content, beautiful and cheerful. These people are necessary to 
 Socialist society, without them socialism cannot be done 
 fully ».
      </p>
<p>
       Krupskaya wrote more than 3000 publications among books, 
 magazines, articles and pamphlets, especially about the formation of the 
  Youth and communist education that should be secular, universal, 
 free and mandatory for all, include both sexes, with a 
 democratic organization where there was a wide participation of the 
 population in the election of school committees, with full freedom of 
  opinion and with the right to receive education in your native language.
      </p>
<p>
       In 1919, Krupskaya, along with other comrades, created the
       <em>
        Jenotdel
       </em>
       , 
  an apartment that worked to improve the living conditions of 
 women in the educational field, in their rights in marriage and 
 at work. From this organization the publication of the 
 Feminist newspaper
       <em>
        Communist
       </em>
       , where it was written about the situation of women and their rights.
      </p>
<p>
       The
       <em>
        Jenotdel
       </em>
       And his press allowed the first years 
 After the Russian revolution, they witness the great achievements in 
 issues such as sexual diversity and women's rights. 
 Before the revolution, according to Kupskaya's words: «Family life 
 It was based on slavery: children were owned by parents, and 
  Woman, from the husband », but that situation surpassed the laws that 
 Soviet legislation established: the punishment of the 
 homosexuality, women had the right to vote and to be candidates, 
  The right to divorce was automatically facilitated and granted, there were 
 access to universal and free education, equal salary between men and 
  Women, aid to relieve family burdens and abortion right 
 free and free, it was established that sons and daughters inside or outside 
  marriage had the same rights, the permit of 
 maternity, more rights were granted to women at work and 
  established the equality of the spouses in relation to the children and 
 daughters. Surprising achievements for the time and that constituted a great 
 progress in the struggle of the female movement.

<p>
       For Krupskaya, the long hours of women of women in the 
 Factory had as its main consequence that many boys and girls 
 They grow in the streets, and in some cases, mothers, without capacity 
 No time to educate them, they decided to intern their children in orphanages. 
 It was necessary to end the exploitation of working women and that 
 The society guarantees the education and food of childhood. By 
 This created childhood gardens that would allow women to go to 
 work with the certainty that their children would be very careful and 
 fed In addition, the education that children would receive in the 
  Public School would take the importance of work as a basis 
 productive, creative and multilateral.
      </p>
<p>
       After Lenin's death, which occurred in 1924, Krupskaya dedicated great 
 Part of his time to edit the work of his late husband. By 
 importance that the comrade had in the preparation and execution of the 
 Proletarian revolution, for his work in favor of socialism, were 
 granted several distinctions: in 1929, the red flag of work; in 
 1931, was appointed honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the 
 USSR and, in 1933, Lenin's order was granted. In 1933 he published his 
 book of Memories
       <em>
        My life with Lenin
       </em>
       And since 1937, Krupskaya was a member of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
      </p>
<p>
       On February 27, 1939, he died in Moscow, the day after 
 have turned 70. His ashes were deposited with Lenin 
  In his mausoleum and Comrade Stalin presided over his burial. The achievements 
 outstanding in the field of literacy led to the fact that, in 
 1970, the Unesco imperialist will appoint Nadezhda Krupskaya to her prize 
 Annual to merit in the fight against illiteracy.
      </p>
<p>
       The thought and actions of communist women of such 
 from Nadezhda Constantínovna Kruupskaya marked true milestones in the 
 Historical struggle of the female labor movement. The best tribute to him 
  We can give to the comrade is the application of their ideas, its fight in 
  around the female movement and for a public education and quality 
 for the people. In their tribute today women continue to march for 
  the organization of the revolutionary party in all countries and by the 
  Construction of the Communist International, which leads to the proletariat 
 World to take from the sky by assault.

 Georges Abdallah is not only a resistant; It is itself a symbol of the resistance and it is
 <br/>
 well for what the French state continues to keep it in prison despite the two decisions of
 <br/>
 justice authorizing his release. The cause of our comrade is intrinsically linked to our support for
 <br/>
 Palestine. That no action, initiative, gathering, demonstration happens without being chanted, displayed,
 <br/>
 written our requirement and in particular through this watchword which should never be truncated from its two
 <br/>
 Components: “Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Release Georges Abdallah! " - Because one was completely
 <br/>
 Given to his cause and the other cannot leave this torch of his resistance to the hands of the enemy. All those, in
 <br/>
 France and elsewhere, in solidarity with Palestine, must demand at every moment and wherever we are the
 <br/>
 Liberation of this fighter from the Palestinian Liberation Movement. And what better support can we
 <br/>
 Bring to the Palestinian resistance except by putting pressure on our own imperialism to tear off
 <br/>
 To this enemy one of his historic fighters!
 <br/>
 Since June 8, a new phase has opened up in this long battle that its support leads
 <br/>
 For his release: while mobilization, in the field, in the diversity of his expressions, continues to
 <br/>
 Amplifying, Georges Abdallah agreed to launch a new legal offensive by depositing a tenth
 <br/>
 Request for liberation-expulsion to its country Lebanon. Let us support by our actions the Georges approach
 <br/>
 Abdallah by making her resonate everywhere throughout the time of examining her new request and accentuons
 <br/>
 Always the pressure on the French state by our ever more increased mobilization and at all times!
 <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
<br/>
 It is in this sense and taking into account this new phase that we call once again to a month
 <br/>
 International actions for the release of Georges Abdallah from March 6 to April 6, 2024, - Date of the 14th
 <br/>
 demonstration in front of the Lannemezan penitentiary center. That during this time coordinated a thousand initiatives
 <br/>
 flourish everywhere in France and internationally for its release and there even for its solidarity fight
 <br/>
 With historical Palestine!
 <br/>
 Georges Abdallah is in prison for the political fight that has been his, for his positions and his ideals that he
 <br/>
 did not stop proclaiming and never denying. It is for his emancipation ideas that Georges Abdallah
 <br/>
 engaged in the struggle. It is for his ideas and resistance that he is still detained today. It's for his
 <br/>
 Ideas and its revolutionary fight that we support it and that we demand its release! For victory
 <br/>
 Or victory!
 <br/>
 Palestine live, live and defeat! Release Georges Abdallah!
 <br/>
 Let's continue the fight! Let's free Georges Abdallah!
 <br/>
 May a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish for his release!
 <br/>
 Honor to all those who fight for his release!
 <br/>
 It is together and only together, comrades, that we will defeat!

     <em>

     spoke with three survivors to what has been called the 
 "Flour massacre", which led to the killing and injury of 
 Almost 1,000 Palestinians waiting for humanitarian aid.
     <br>
     “We were surprised by the shots of the employment forces e 
 from the killing of dozens of people while we were waiting for aid

    Of 
 Nabulsi, in the Sheikh Ajleen district, south-west of Gaza City, 
 while we were waiting for the trucks.
    <br>
    Rajab, together with his cousin, went to the roundabout to wait for the 
 humanitarian trucks, with the hope of finally being able to get some 
  Flour.
    <br>
    "For over two months my family has not tasted bread," Rajab told us, "for this reason we decided to go".
    <br/>
    “The trucks should have arrived on Wednesday. However, we have 
 Wait throughout the day and nothing has arrived. We have decided to

     "We were 
  Sitting on the beach and was very cold. But hunger was stronger 
 of anything else and thousands of people gathered there for 
 get food. In Gaza City there is nothing to eat and we live in 
  difficult conditions ”,
     <br/>
     “As soon as the trucks entered the area, the Israeli forces have 
 started shooting heavily, causing the killing and injury of 
 Dozens of people, "said Rajab.
     <br/>
     "The occupation did not spare us and has deliberately fired against 
  Of us while we were waiting for the aid convoy, "he added.
     <br/>
     “Despite my advanced age, I was lined up after a lot 
 cold, like all the residents of Gaza City, "said Hajj Mahmoud 
  Daghmash in The Palestine Chronicle.
     <br/>
     “We had been waiting for hours when we finally sighted the trucks. 
  At that moment, Israeli occupation opened fire against 
 We with shots and artillery bombings, "continued Daghmash.
     <br/>
     “Fear has filled all our hearts and people started 
 run anywhere. We didn't know where to hide. The screams of the wounded, 
 of women and children felt everywhere. "
     <br/>
     The occupation killed us twice, "Daghmas explained:" Once 
 When he bombed our homes, and then again making us die of 
 hunger".
     <br/>
     I can bear hunger, but my children and my family does not, and it is 
 extremely painful not to be able to provide for my children and mine 
 family". All the people in line only hoped to return from theirs 
  families with a lot of flour. Instead, over 100 people are back 
  Like martyrs and more than 800 they have returned as injured ".
     <br/>
     Daghmas explained that after more than a month the employment allowed 
 truck to enter and ranked the area of Sheikh Ajleen as the only one 
 corridor for aid.
     <br/>
     "This is a new war crime committed by the occupation against innocent civilians in the Gaza strip," he concluded.
     <br/>
     Yahya Salamia was also among the Palestinians waiting for humanitarian trucks 
  to Gaza City. It was particularly indignant when he realized 
  of how Israel has tried to distort the facts and to argue that i 
  Palestinians represented a threat to military vehicles.
     <br/>
     “We were all civil, unarmed. We just wanted to return to ours 
 Families with a lot of flour and a little food, "he told us.
     <br/>
     “Ben Gvir boasted the massacre and thanked the soldiers. This is 
  the biggest test that employment continues to commit a 
 genocide against the population of Gaza, "continued Salamia.
     <br/>
     "Occupation tries to deny the accusation of genocide to the Court 
 International justice, but every day he commits dozens of crimes e 
  works with all his strength to exterminate the population of Gaza e 
 displaced her from her lands ".

<strong>
   Our comrades in Socialist Revolution report that the Danish war industry has sold material to the Israeli army actively used in their folk murderer campaign against the Palestinians in Gaza.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  They write that the war manufacturer "Mydefence" in November and December in Fjord sold anti -rone equipment worth tens of millions of Danish kroner to Israel. The equipment in question is designed to give individual soldiers warning about incoming drones and the opportunity to "jam" them. Bilt has a great demand for such technology since the Palestinian resistance movement has begun to use hobby drones to attack IDF goals.
 </p>
<p>
  This comes on top of the already existing arms trade that Danish imperialism does with Israel, including parts for the F-35 fighter aircraft used in the merciless bombing of Gaza. This is a clear violation of obligations made through
  <a href="https://danwatch.dk/usas-regering-afviser-loekkes-forklaring-i-sag-om-danske-vaabenleverancer-til-israels-kampfly/">
   The UN's arms trafficking treaties
  </a>
  As we have heard from Norwegian war manufacturers, such as Nammo, Danish companies also try to waive the responsibility by claiming that the treaties do not apply to sales to third -partnations such as the United States, knowing that these weapons and parts will be resold to Israel.
 </p>

    Austrofascism raged in Austria 90 years ago. Democratic and social rights were smashed, there was massive wage robbery and steady increase in unemployment - over half a million was unemployed. There was censorship, freedom of expression was switched off, the freedom of the press was lifted, the Heimwehr carried out the new "laws", the status was introduced. However, the workers were held back from the struggle by the social democratic leadership. Nevertheless, a heroic resistance organized against fascism. The struggle of the workers, the protective bundles and the communist was bloodily depressed, but formed the basis for the further structure of the resistance against Austrofascism and for resistance to occupation by the National Socialists. In this regard, February 1934 was an important and great victory in the fight against fascism. The armed struggle was not a "mistake", as is often attempted to say, but could have gone much further if it had been led in a revolutionary way. So the most important content of the speaker.

    The participants of the discussion event emphasized that there are similarities today. In retrospect for the corona measures critic movement, looking at the broad Palestine-Inasolidarity movement, we are still facing the situation of censorship, restrictions on the right to demonstrate and prohibitions of meetings. The struggle of the working class is still attempted to hold back today by the trade union and mainly reduced to the question of wages. Against this background, the participants stated that it is also the monol media that are used as an instrument for splitting and agitation in the population.

    The CGS sent the limitation of participation in the strike of the women of the workers and workers throughout the Region of Abruzzo and in all sectors a few days after 8 March.
   </b>
   Why? Because the elections to be held in the Abruzzo region must not be disturbed by the workers' strikes, but everyone must be at the service of the bourgeois elections.

<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); padding: 3px 6px;">

    In

 transport can be done, for the proclamation of the Slai Cobas for the 
 class union.

    In 
  particular, on the woman's day the participating workers will stop

 have proclaimed a general stop of the public, private sectors and 
 cooperatives.

<i>
    The 
  irregularities reported by the Commission concern in particular the 
 passenger transport sector (plane, railway, maritime and 
 local public) which prohibits concentration in general strikes. TO 
 following these reports, "the aforementioned sectors will be interested 
 exclusively by the strike proclaimed by the Slai Cobas union for the 
  Class union and not from the other union acronyms ".

<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;">
<i>
    Furthermore, 
  The Commission invited the unions proclaiming to exclude, 
 limited to the Abruzzo Region, affected by the consultations 
 electoral of 10 March 2024, the sectors: local autonomy regions, 
 Local public transport, environmental hygiene, telecommunications, 
 Electricity, energy and oil, gas-water, funerary, ministries, 
 Maritime transport, firefighters, helicopters and fuels.

    Let's report these prohibitions! But the right way is to go down massively on strike on March 8!

  A gathering and a course of solidarity in the struggle of the Palestinian people took place in Heraklion on Saturday in the Lions. The "Open Solidarity Assembly for the Palestinians" was the initiative for the call.

    On 21 February there was an electronic assembly promoted by Nudm which saw the large participation of companions, women, young people who work in the social sector, social cooperatives in different areas, school, health, RSA, psychiatric, etc. This electronic meeting emerged from the work table of the Nudm Bologna National Assembly. We also participated from Palermo bringing the complaint and the experience of struggling of the precarious of social coops.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    It was an interesting and lively assembly because he saw a succession of interventions that actually told the work experiences of workers especially precariously of this sector, of many cities from North to South, through which a significant and also strong denunciation emerged of the aspects of exploitation, of precarious and unstable working conditions, of collective employment contracts, signed by the confederals, increasingly downward - see the hypothesis of the last contract reported in various interventions - of even denied basic rights, of discrimination also specifically towards women's workers, of forms of repression at work, if you fight to obtain improvements in the working condition, by the masters and mastery of the social cooperatives, large or small, and of the contracting institutions at different levels towards and against a Work sector made up of thousands of workers, who are the majority of it.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    In the second part of the meeting, it was discussed on how to concretely bring all this complaint and struggle where it is already done, in a visible and active way in the March 8 strike. Certainly important is the need that emerged in general to start building a connection/network among the workers/workers in the sector to start breaking the jagging or isolation at work which also emerged from some interventions, the different realities of this sector, to strengthen The knowledge of realities, supporting itself ... the strike of 8 March is an important stage in this sense.

    The precarious social coop workers of Palermo personal hygienic assistants, deal with disabled students and students of high schools, are qualified OSS and OSA, is a sector by majority women, the working condition has worsened year by year, increasingly precarious, Years ago the contracts were biennial, now we are also at the extension of months, a condition of work instability and life, you cannot make projects, you cannot make decisions because you never know if the extension will be made ... the precarious workers have been organized for years Union with the Slai Cobas for SC and have first struggled in recent years against the cuts of jobs and resources by the region/metropolitan city increasingly falcidiate by trampling every law in force in this country for which these services are instead defined mandatory and Essential, and today with the Meloni government that cut millions of euros for the disabled fund, the situation has worsened ... Then there are almost paradoxical aspects that affect these precarious workers, for example the so -called "genre" question, a assignment of users To the operators imposed by the metropolitan city contracting to the coops since last year on the basis of the "genre" and in front of an audience of disabled students under male majority in this city, the precarious ones remain out of work because the coops are obliged to hire men, aside The factual institutions is also an ideological fury against women that we are denouncing ... we have been struggling for years starting with wages not paid by the Coop chairs for the fact that being women and being maintained by husbands, companions the women could wait for men compared to men who had to have precedence, but on this with the fight for months, also occupying the offices of the Coop, today it is paid as it is right that it is like male colleagues but it remains that wages are low, they are made 24 hours a week but not The days in which pupils are absent are counted, when there are the suspensions of the lessons, etc. and in any case the mains always try by trying to deny basic rights such as parental leave or holidays for example ... we have always actively participated in the strike of the March 8 trying to connect with the other workers on strike, first of all bringing the whole denunciation of the condition of exploitation and oppression that we live in the workplace but also the problems we live as women, we are women with children to whom all the work is downloaded of care, separated, single, we do not arrive at the end of the month, we also do double, triple jobs even in black to raise a salary if you can say decent, some precarious have also undergone violent family situations of husbands who have also tried to prevent them from going down Fighting but we did unity on this by actively supporting them for example in the difficult path of separating and on this having a job is important ... In the 8 -Martosis strike it will bring all the anger and fight against the owners, the government, today it is necessary to fight Against the Meloni government which is ideologically and politically against women and who is giving more and more free hand to the masters see the liberalization of contracts ... The precarious workers of Palermo are also undergoing a criminal trial for the struggles made to defend the work and against the cuts , denounced by the metropolitan city during an action of fighting the palace today are facing this process with courage because this process is also intended as a struggle ... this too will bring to the strike ... we will be on strike again on this March 8 and it is important to connect with all the other realities.

As operators in schools we are not paid when children are firmly, a vademecum would also be necessary to explain the problems of the CCNL as a self -defense manual ... this March 8 must be of anger with all the others, we are angry, tired, we work all day, we do not have free time (we work at school, day centers, psychiatric sphere) sometimes even more than 12 hours, often we are alone, with Small numbers in the strikes and this disintegration causes. We would like to strike from everything, against wages from hunger, against the bank of hours, we do not want to take home the job, not to the changes of program without warning, to picking up the holes ... strike because if you assert your rights then you are nervous, exhausted , outside of what "Mamma Coop" says ... in recent years we have made several battles, even small at national level, but we still cannot mobilize more united ...

    We are badly put in the workplace, when we work for many years in Italy we migrants sign a new contract with another cooperative and they spot all the seniority of service previously accrued and we must start from scratch, but we work in this country as The Italians and pay taxes like all, we want to be recognized at work, last year every 3 months we changed cooperative, we were entitled to the house etc. but the paycheck always starts again from scratch, you lose holidays, seniority, everything and then there are All the problems related to the residence permit, half of our life is consumed here, but we work for the masters here and we have rights like everyone ... have we wrong country? Do you want to pour our blood to get the rights? We have no right to have citizenship, our children born here, even at school the teachers do not denounce the problems of our children who are often considered different ... we need to struggle on these points, so the caravan, with very low salaries You don't even get in the middle of the month ...

  “Finland's model with regard to military service and army is oriented to adopt the Ministry of National Defense of Greece. It is recalled that National Defense Minister Nikos Dendias recently went to Finland to be informed by his Finnish counterpart of how the country's army works.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In particular, Nikos Dendias attended the training of reserves in a Military Unit in Finland as part of his visit to the Scandinavian country.

  Finland has half the population from Greece, but it has a strong militia that is trained every year in the use of weapons and the operation of small scales, as reported in a report in the afternoon. Its army consists of a skeleton of professional soldiers surrounded by any available citizen. Indeed, after the Russian attack on Ukraine, he decided to enhance the education of all citizens, both men and women, opening more than 300 new shootings to boost defense, according to the same report.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Mr Dendias said he was impressed by the fact that "in a very short time, young people are turning into soldiers who can fight and defend themselves", as well as by the fact that "there is a great, extensive use of ammunition. And there is an extensive training interval in the forests and in real battle.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The militarization of all society with an extensive period of continuous re -education, women's recruitment, etc. The new model that excited the Minister of Defense who welcomed the Appeal in the manner of the Americans (putting his right hand in the heart).
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The man is not held ...
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Once upon a time in our education, the minds were taken with the "Finnish model" in education.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  They are now referring to the same model this time for ... military service.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Given that the Finnish government has decided to join the NATO military part and is at the forefront of a military confrontation with Russia by "breaking" a policy of neutrality.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Not only the youth (mainly this, of course) all the meat population for the war machine of imperialism!

  The demonstration started with a rally at 2:00 p.m. at the Neptune fountain, passed the outstanding office and ended at Potsdamer Platz. In the speeches, the genocide on the Volke of Palestine, was condemned by the Zionist butcher Israel. The role of Yankee imperialism and German imperialism were also presented in the speeches, and by the demonstration participants in slogans like "Germany, why not a word? denounced. In addition, the situation, for example in Congo, Sudan, Afghanistan and Armenia, was made aware of the situation in different speeches, and called for the oppressed peoples of the world to join together and rebel against the rulers.

<p>
  In the reporting of the Bürgelichen Presse, there is no language that demonstrators and organizers continue to be criminalized. When the demonstration reached the location of the end rally, two folders were arrested by the police for no apparent reason and their personal details were found. The demonstrators protested Lautstrak, on the other hand, the demonstration was not ended until both folders were released.

  With good mass and pulse, on Saturday, March 2nd, the course of the defense of the popular residence, and the complaint of the policy and auctions policy in the neighborhood of Kallithea, where the "Dovalue" headquarters are housed. The mobilization began with a gathering and microphone at ISAP station, and continued with a march in central places in the neighborhood, as well as the company's offices.
 </p>
<p>
  The presence of the repressive forces in the neighborhood has been continuous and provocative during it, which can only be interpreted as another example of the intentions of the system to suppress any efforts to resist and claim.
 </p>
<p>
  In the mobilization they called for initiatives against auctions, neighborhood shapes and organizations/collectives. The roads of resistance, intervening with distinct banners, announcement and slogans, emphasized the necessity of connecting the struggle against the evictions with the struggle to defend the popular home before it "passes" into the hands of the various banks/funds/services, as well as the necessity The struggle for the defense of the popular housing with the struggle for health - EDUCATION - WORK AND SUBJECTIVE RIGHTS. Positive was the partition of the world of Kallithea where not only did he take the resistance roads but also congratulated!

   Thessaloniki organizations and colleges, with the participation of members of the Palestinian community, are organizing a screening of Abby Martin's documentary, "Gaza Fights for Freedom" (2019).
  </b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  We invite the Thessaloniki to watch in the first Greek translation a shocking documentary that highlights the fair struggle of the heroic people of Palestine for a lighter and independent homeland. We are struggling to cease the slaughter of the Palestinians in the martyred Gaza, to cease all Greece's involvement in Israel-US/NATO murder plans.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
   We are waiting for you on Saturday, March 9, at 7:30 pm at the Thessaloniki Labor Center to watch this shocking documentary together.
  </b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Voluntary reinforcement of 3 € upon entry.

  For the documentary (summary from Peoplesforum.org):

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  This first feature film by journalist Abby Martin began while reporting in Palestine, where the Israeli government banned her to enter Gaza on charges of being a "propagandist". Thus, Abby was associated with a group of journalists in Gaza to produce the film through the excluded border. It is a documentary on the historical demonstrations of the long way of return, which took place every week from March 2018 to December 2019, but it covers much more. It tells Gaza's story in the past and present, projecting rare archive material that explains the story that has never been recognized by the media. You hear from the victims of the ongoing massacre, including journalists, doctors and the family of internationally recognized paramedic Razan al-Najar. At its core, "Gaza Fights for Freedom" is a detailed Israeli army indictment for war crimes with exclusive documents and a stunning cinematic depiction of the Palestinian heroic resistance.

  On the night of last Thursday, the Jena city council agreed to increase the tariff of the Middle Dogen Transport Association (VMT). This is intended to increase the ticket price in Jena local transport by 9.97 percent. A single ticket then costs 2.70 euros instead of the previous 2.50 euros. A return trip costs 5.40 euros. Children's cards also become 10 cents more expensive and then cost 1.80 euros. Only last year in April there was an increase in driving prices by 7.78 percent. The subscription offers are also more expensive by around 10 percent.

According to Mayor Christian Gerlitz (SPD), 18,500 of the approximately 20,000 regular customers in the local public transport already have the 49 euro ticket, which affects only 1,500 public transport users directly from the increase.

  Much of public life in Jena takes place in the city center. People who live on the edge of the wide range and have no car must fall back on public transport. The high fees for local transport represent a hurdle for people, not only to get to work or school or university, but also to have part in the social life of the city. In Jena, for example, there is no free local transport for students and trainees.

A political decision by the rulers in this country, whether funds are used for the expansion and financing of public transport or for EU military operations and the rescue of "systematic banks".

  The event was accompanied by both competitors and friends of the figure, as well as a world that responded to the calls of the figure through its interventions, a point that shows the need and search for the world for answers and struggles!
 </p>
<p>
  The discussion was opened by the figure with two presentations both its presentation, its basic positions and directions, and the highlights of the basic issues of the period locally and generally. The discussion, which was opened by many competitors and friends, put all the popular problems on the table. From accuracy and auctions, hitting health and education, fascism, free spaces, to war and solidarity in Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  Obvious, of all positions, was the need - anxiety of "what do we do, how do we fight". This question is trying to answer our shape and will give all its strengths immediately to open them in our neighborhoods in better terms. To create resistance fires in every neighborhood, to get the people in their hands.

  Special reference is worthwhile to address the neighborhood shapes with a corresponding racing orientation in other areas of Athens, such as the roads of Agioi Anargyroi - Kamaterou and Piraeus Popular Resistance, as well as other militants from the rest of the North Athens.
 </p>
<p>
  The event ended with the logic on our part for taking the initiative to address and other neighborhood schemes, local bodies, workers 'unions, teachers, parents' associations, to open the issue of attack on education with as massively as possible in our neighborhood. For organizing a demonstration and other actions that will highlight this issue in the neighborhood, so that the people themselves will take it on it. As well as the issue of accuracy and auctions. To enable the neighborhood world to express its anger and take the situation in his hands against conciliation, assignment and fatalism. Finally, we are not convinced by the statements of municipal authorities - Adonis Georgiadis about the "promise" of the Nea Ionia Health Center and the return of the pharmacy and that we have to organize new mobilizations on the issue until we have the right to equal, complete, complete, free, free Care for everyone.

<strong>
   MARCH BELONGS TO THOSE WHO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS, AND NOT
  </strong>
<strong>
   TO
  </strong>
<strong>
   THOSE WHO WAIT FOR THEIR RIGHTS!
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  On March 8 this year, we women will have to listen again to the claims of the imperialist system and the reactionary male-dominated culture that great progress has been made in “women’s rights”. On the occasion of March 8, it will once again be expressed on television, in parliaments, in squares, on stands and on international platforms that women’s freedoms from working life to social life and fundamental rights have expanded and must expand. On March 8 they will celebrate “International Women’s Day” with greater “enthusiasm” than we do, and they will give speeches about women’s rights.
 </p>
<p>
  On the one hand, they will tell us the lie about how much progress they have made on women’s rights, and on the other hand, they will obscure the historical significance, content and essence of March 8. They will obscure the class structure of women’s struggle for rights and freedom and pretend that they were the ones who gave women their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  However, we know what the truth is. March 8, 1857, is the bloody story of a strike organized by 40,000 working women in New York to demand “the shortening of the 16-hour workday to 10 hours and equal pay for equal work.” During the strike, thousands of workers were locked up in the factory by police with the support of bosses, and 129 striking workers died in the ensuing flames. At the International Socialist Women’s Conference in 1910, at the suggestion of Clara Zetkin, March 8, International Working Women’s Day, was dedicated to the memory of the murdered strikers.
 </p>
<p>
  The reality of the imperialist bourgeoisie and all reactionary forces that talk about women’s rights by obscuring the class character of March 8, which is ours, is completely different. In dozens of semi-feudal, semi-colonial countries like Turkey, even our most basic rights are like an oasis in the desert. The exercise of many fundamental rights such as the right to life, inviolability, freedom and security, freedom of establishment and travel, freedom of thought and expression, economic freedom, the right to work and divorce and the right to engage in politics are rights that are both difficult and that when we see them, we women are murdered, exposed to violence, isolated and exposed to social pressure. In Turkey alone, 52 women were murdered for various reasons in January 2024. In countries such as India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the countries of the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Turkey, brutal violence and murder of women are on the agenda.
 </p>
<p>
  In countries like Europe, the “center of civilization,” we women seem to have easier access to basic rights, but social conditions and relationships here are also dominated by male dominance. This is reflected in physical violence, emotional and psychological pressure and economic disadvantage. When the imperialists sound the drums of war, increasing armament and chauvinism, we will be confronted with their demonstration of violence, which includes all of this. In this show of power, the first and greatest victimization comes back to us as language, attitude and oppression in the form of male domination. The answer to this is more violence, more exclusion and incarceration, more femicide. The murder of 7 women within 24 hours on February 27th is just one result of this escalation. However, in Europe, which is portrayed as the center of freedom, there are complex problems. We are the main employment group in flexible and precarious working relationships. We are “condemned” to work for less pay. We are still the ones most responsible for the care work. All the consequences of impoverishment, such as stress, tension and suffering, are primarily to the detriment of women. We toiling and working women, whose access to basic rights is made more difficult, are also subjected to harsher working conditions, bullying and cheap labor. This economic crisis is becoming increasingly clear as warmongering and chauvinism escalate.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialists, who are the enemies of the peoples and working women, can never hide their true face in the wars they wage or provoke. In Palestine, the war machine of Zionist Israel is carrying out a massacre that makes no distinction between children, women and the elderly. Women are the weak link in this cruelty. On the one hand they are being massacred with a ruthless blockade, on the other hand they are being treated as “oppressed” objects in attempts at a ceasefire. To denigrate the Palestinian resistance, the imperialists are once again developing psychological warfare over women’s bodies. In the figure of the “barbaric Palestinians” the women’s problem is hypocritically used as a lever.
 </p>
<p>
  The rotten imperialist system, with the wars and its semi-colonial policies that it causes and provokes, creates economic destruction, which leads to a major emigration problem. The migration routes are in the network of a brutal smuggling system. On these routes we women are exposed to harassment, rape and all kinds of violence. The ordeal of women settling in other countries as migrants never ends. They are forced to become cheap workers. In addition, they are squeezed between the culture of the society from which they come and the culture of the society in which they live and are condemned to endure all kinds of difficulties. Here, too, female migrant workers are most affected by sexual violence and harassment. When it comes to exercising their basic rights, they face all the difficulties related to consciousness, equipment and inadequacies as well as female identity. All hindering, oppressive and restrictive aspects of the state system, family and social life are part of the life of migrant workers.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialist system, with its decaying capital, its degenerate culture, its hypocritical democracy, its structure whose other feature is war, is the production center of all kinds of reaction that usurp women’s rights and freedom and drag us into the vortex of male-dominated violence. Their alliances with the feudal forces in their semi-colonies are misogynistic. The chauvinism, rearmament and war politics that they foment in their own countries are also culturally based on male supremacy and fuel misogyny. The honey that they smear around our mouths means that we are content with what is available and accept our fate. Which in turn would mean that we accept their exploitative, bloodsucking, misogynistic system, including male supremacy.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   We won’t accept it. We won’t submit. We will not shy away from our
  </strong>
<strong>
   struggle
  </strong>
<strong>
   .
  </strong>
  We will not settle for limited, symbolic rights. There will be no liberation of working women as long as the source of exploitation, violence, poverty, aggression and unjust wars does not dry up. We will fight our battle with the consciousness of complete liberation, not less. We will conduct our struggle not with a liberal spirit, but with a revolutionary spirit.
 </p>
<p>
  For this reason, 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March is neither a mere “Women’s Day” nor an instrument of capitalist consumer culture.
 </p>
<p>
  March 8th;
 </p>
<p>
  – … is a call to struggle against unjust imperialist wars.
 </p>
<p>
  – … is a call for rebellion against the multiple exploitation and oppression of female workers.
 </p>
<p>
  – … is a call to expand women’s revolutionary organization and struggle in this process in which exploitation increases and “slave” laws are introduced.
 </p>
<p>
  – … is a call to struggle against all impositions of patriarchal culture, religious reaction and all forms of discrimination.
 </p>
<p>
  – … is a call to organize against State violence against communist, revolutionary and progressive women in dungeons, in prison and on the streets.
 </p>
<p>
  As Purple-Red collectives, we will face March 8th, International Working Women’s Day, in the streets and squares with all our enthusiasm, challenging
  <strong>
   “frustration and despair
  </strong>
  ,” smashing misogyny, opposing imperialist plunder and exploitation, and never let ourselves be chained by fascism and feudalism.

  The consultation-lean ended. On Friday, March 8, the government with the US and EU guidelines violently brings the Pierrakakis bill to vote in Parliament. They tremble the voice of the tens of thousands of students on the streets and the educational world that requires the withdrawal of the bill. The entire system of rotten and corruption, barbarism and dependency, government representatives and parrots of the media have fallen with rage on the students.

  March 8, as a voting day in the House, not only was not accidentally chosen by the government, but it shows the deep hatred of a system that wants to take the rematch from the youth. In 2007, the magnificent march on March 8, with tens of thousands of students on the streets on the day of the then Giannakos law, was a highlight of the 2006-2007 movement that hurt them deeply. A movement that blocked the revision of Article 16 and managed to prevent class barriers planning to put so many governments. A movement that has earned a time credit to free studies for many more generations of admissions to date.

</p>
<p>
  The proletarian woman carries the weight of double oppression on her shoulders: capitalist and patriarchal. On the one hand she is a worker, suffering the capitalist exploitation of wage labor. Additionally she is a woman under the class society where patriarchy develops, suffering the reactionary force of custom and tradition, which maintains the yoke of domestic work once her workday is over.
 </p>
<p>
  And this not being enough, the capitalist and patriarchal exploitation suffered by the proletarian woman are intertwined, making her living conditions even worse. The proletarian woman is concentrated, in the labor market, in those sectors with worse working conditions and suffers belittlement, humiliation and sexual harassment. Meanwhile, in the domestic sphere, she suffers the consequences of these poor working conditions: she cannot reconcile family life and is forced to work split shifts and/or part-time. From the relationship between capitalist and patriarchal oppression, in the era of imperialism in its greatest phase of decomposition, it develops the cruelest forms of discrimination, vexation and humiliation. Even sexual slavery, such as prostitution.
 </p>
<p>
  Given this general situation, the picture does not improve in the Spanish context. The wage gap -the structural difference between what a man and a woman earn in the same jobs- remains. Although the government, the State institutions and the trade union leaders -who follow bourgeois feminism- affirm that the wage gap has decreased, they base themselves solely and exclusively on data from the increase in the Minimum Interprofessional Wage (SMI), leaving out millions of women who work off the books. The right to abortion is continually attacked by reactionary and ultra-Catholic groups -financed directly or indirectly by the institutions, parties of the bourgeoisie and by the Catholic Church-, which carry out campaigns of harassment and attack against abortion clinics, blackmailing women who wish to have an abortion in every possible way. The low number of public day-care centers that exist -and not in all cities- make life difficult for mothers, especially single mothers.
 </p>
<p>
  We cannot lose sight of the youth, whose culture and way of thinking is harshly hit by the ideological offensive of imperialism, developing cruel forms of patriarchal oppression of girls and adolescents. There have been several cases of gang rape by minors under 16 years of age. As if the harassment and hypersexualization of girls and adolescents in schools and institutes were not enough, new technological tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used as tools of blackmail and extortion. Thus, the case of how a group of students distributed fake photography created by AI showing their classmates naked was notorious. During class society, imperialism and patriarchal violence, those advances that should be good for humanity, such as AI, are used for imperialist war, sexual harassment and other patriarchal violence.
 </p>
<p>
  It is visible how the hypersexualization caused by patriarchal canons or standards of beauty affects the youth, but not only them. The proletarian woman, of all ages, is strongly subjected to this social pressure. It is notorious how the number of aesthetic operations has increased by 215% from 2014 to 2021, where it is women who undergo these operations (85% of operations are intended for women). The most common operations are breast implants, rhinoplasty, liposuction and modifications to the face in general. The great increase of aesthetic operations is due to a reduction in the price of surgery and the popularization of installment payments, added to a strong patriarchal pressure. That is how cruel patriarchal violence is.
 </p>
<p>
  All these cases are practical examples of how in the epoch of imperialism, in the phase of its greatest decomposition, the cultural expression of patriarchal violence becomes even more atrocious and humiliating for proletarian women.
 </p>
<p>
  Patriarchal violence, in all its forms, plagues women in all areas of their lives. In the past year 2023, 101 male chauvinist murders were officially recorded. So far in 2024 there are at least 10. There is no defense for women who are raped or assaulted. The “most progressive government in history” claims to be feminist, but does not defend proletarian women against abuse at work, does not break the yoke that binds them to the home, nor does it protect them from those who beat or rape them.
 </p>
<p>
  To be considered a “victim of gender violence” by the bourgeois justice system is a labyrinth in which many women do not succeed. Either because they do not have the economic resources -we already know that the free justice provided by the State is something that does not work in real life-, or because the institutions do not guarantee the right to denounce -how can a woman denounce if the police laugh at her or do not believe her? There are not few cases of rapes in police stations, prisons or Internment Centers for Foreigners (CIE). Is an assaulted woman going to trust the aggressors?- or for any other reason.
 </p>
<p>
  Even relying on bourgeois justice, to be considered a “victim of gender violence” and end up condemning the male chauvinist aggressor, guarantees absolutely nothing. There are not few news where in 2023 we could see how a person convicted of gender violence murders his ex-partner for revenge. Those convicted lead a normal life beyond the punishment -mild and punctual- that at the time is imposed on them. There are even autonomous and national deputies who were convicted in a final sentence, ran for election and were elected!
 </p>
<p>
  The conclusion is that the proletarian woman who rebels and wants to cut ties with the aggressor with whom she lives, cannot. If she reports, she is not assured of victory. If she achieves legal victory, she is not assured the protection of a timely revenge. If she has children, she is not assured of keeping them and the aggressor may have full or shared custody of them.
 </p>
<p>
  We cannot forget how imperialism, Spanish imperialism in this case, preys on women in semi-dependent and semi-feudal countries dominated by imperialism. The most common profile of a prostitute in Spain is that of a Colombian woman between 23 and 28 years old. More than 90% of the prostituted women are foreigners, mainly from these oppressed countries (Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa). In Huelva, strawberry temporary workers in the countryside – who are mainly Moroccan – suffer miserable working hours and wages, along with numerous cases of rape and sexual abuse which they have denounced. Latin American women, throughout the country, are the most employed and sought after profile for cleaning and domestic care work, often being interned in the residence where they live and in conditions of semi-slavery.
 </p>
<p>
  The “most progressive government in history”, the government that says it is feminist, does not protect the proletarian woman. An it never will, this or any other government, because due to the very essence of a government of this nature (which manages the interests of the imperialist bourgeois state), it can not end the nature of the problem of patriarchy (originating in class society and developing in the epoch of monopoly capitalism, i.e., imperialism). The government can only mitigate the problem, and not even effectively!
 </p>
<p>
  Facing bourgeois feminism in all its variants, there was no purely proletarian feminism that imposed the class position of the proletariat, which is nothing else than the organization, mobilization and politization of the proletarian woman to destroy imperialism and class society to thus destroy the patriarchy. The proletarian woman can only liberate herself by liberating herself as a class, since the problems she suffers from come directly from class society.
 </p>
<p>
  Facing bourgeois feminism, we must defend, raise and apply proletarian feminism. The proletarian woman can not be a slave for much longer. The centuries of oppression, humiliation, violence and exploitation in all its forms must be sent to the place it should never leave: the trash heap of history.

  The class struggle is raging all over the world. Wherever we look, we see the wars, the genocide, the bloodbaths and massacres that imperialism is unleashing in a desperate attempt to escape its impending doom. Imperialism, which brings wealth and prosperity to the exploiters and poverty and misery to the exploited, is in a deep crisis, fueled by the ongoing struggle of the peoples of the world who are courageously and stubbornly fighting against the yoke of their oppression. The grimace of this dying beast is particularly ugly at present in Palestine, where Yankee imperialism with its Israeli butchers – also supported by German imperialism! – is driving forward the heinous genocide of the Palestinian people, who are holding up the flag of resistance and defending it with their blood. Even though the enemy is armed to the teeth and equipped with the latest technology, the people of Palestine are fighting fearlessly with all the means at their disposal, proving day after day that victory is theirs. The role played by the women of the people – also within the National Resistance Front of the People of Palestine – is by no means passive or limited to mere “support work”, on the contrary, the women of our class and people are fighting at the front line! The participation of women in the decades-long heroic struggle of the people of Palestine has existed as long as this struggle itself and the rest of the world is no different; the best examples of this are the people’s wars in Peru, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Wherever there is struggle, women are also standing up and showing that half the sky is theirs and they will conquer it!
 </p>
<p>
  In this country, too, the women of our class are doubly oppressed – by imperialism and patriarchy – and therefore have twice the reason to struggle. Each of us can feel this every day. We are forced to allow ourselves to be exploited at work, often under miserable conditions, and at the same time we are expected to look after the children and the household without pay, not to mention relatives in need of care. Our bosses are lining their pockets, and if we and our class brothers no longer bring them profit, they let us fall into unemployment or short-time work overnight, robbing us of our last wages.
 </p>
<p>
  The bourgeois state does everything it can to maintain this state of affairs; after all, its own existence depends on it. It is therefore not surprising that we are the first to be affected by austerity measures, while the big money is invested in arms deliveries and armaments so that the German State can secure its imperialist interests in the world, be it in Ukraine or in the so-called “Middle East”. After the government headed by Olaf Scholz recently shifted money around unconstitutionally in the interests of the bourgeoisie in the usual gangster manner, the billions that are now missing are to be made up by cutting social spending, among other things. As always, the burden is being placed on the shoulders of the working class. The planned cuts, e.g. in citizens’ benefits, will hit us women particularly hard, as we in Germany still earn almost 20% less than men, while we are almost ten times more likely to be single parents and therefore more often dependent on financial support. We have also been waiting for over a year for the promised “basic-security for children” spending, but more than one of five children in Germany still lives in poverty and there is no prospect of improvement anywhere at sight. The situation is no better when it comes to childcare: Although every child from the age of one is entitled by law to a place in a daycare center, there is a shortage of almost 400,000 places throughout Germany, especially in working-class neighborhoods. The few daycare centers that do exist, as well as schools, after-school care centers and other childcare facilities, are systematically understaffed, cut to the bone and allowed to fall into disrepair: Another factor forcing us into unemployment! The rulers are also only too happy to save on our health: on top of the already miserable health care for the entire working class, we women are faced with the immense reduction in delivery rooms and maternity wards, a huge shortage of gynecologists and clinics that perform abortions. And when we feel the effects of patriarchy, for example through domestic violence, in most cases the perpetrator is not prosecuted, but the woman is simply sent to a women’s shelter. And even that’s only if you’re lucky, because women’s shelters are also in short supply, contrary to bourgeois law.
 </p>
<p>
  All the State gives us are empty promises. Any apparent improvement is nothing but breadcrumbs thrown to us from time to time to keep our mouths shut. Because there can be no improvement for us within this rotten society. As long as imperialism exists, our exploitation and oppression by the patriarchy will also exist. The one cannot be smashed without the other, because the basis of both is the same: private property. Only the united struggle with our class brothers for a classless society can create the basis for our emancipation. To serve this goal, we need a class-conscious women’s movement that struggles for the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Germany and our actual emancipation!

  One of Mao’s contributions to dialectical materialist philosophy was his reference to the existence of “many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing”. The term “one of his contributions” should be emphasised here. For when it is expressed in this way, the relationship of each contribution to the other contributions seems to be hidden. However, these contributions are intertwined; one brings forth or explains the other. When Mao says that there are “many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing”, he redefines the contradiction, which he understands “as the essence of dialectics”, in reality and on a higher level, thus deepening philosophy. We see in almost all scientific analyses of society that there are many contradictions in the development process of every great thing. Of course, not only in analyses of society, but also in analyses of all complex processes, the existence of many contradictions is mentioned. This is one of the fundamental characteristics of scientific analysis. As we have already emphasised, the theory of philosophy was not completed either by Marx and Engels or by Lenin and Stalin. The chapter “On the Question of Dialectics” in Lenin’s “Philosophical Notebooks” from 1915 and Stalin’s “Dialectical Materialism” are worth mentioning in this context. Lenin’s chapter “On the Question of Dialectics” is the draft of a work. Here Lenin presents the most concise and fundamental aspects of materialist dialectics in a depth and richness that had never been achieved before. It can be said that Stalin’s work is an attempt to complete this work. But even this attempt is incomplete as far as the completion of the theory is concerned. Mao’s contribution lies at the level of completing this theory. By stating that “there are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing”, Mao explains a fundamental feature of the philosophy on which Marxism is based. He makes this clear by explaining the categories of “universality of contradiction”, “specificity of contradiction”, “main contradiction and main aspect of contradiction”, “identity and struggle of contradictory aspects”.
 </p>
<p>
  This thesis is implicit in all scientific analyses. In analysing capitalist society, we see that Marx, having begun by examining the “commodity”, the most general, omnipresent and ubiquitous element of this society, as a contradiction, arrives step by step at “many contradictions” and examines each one in relation to the others. Engels carries out a similar analysis in the “Dialectic of Nature”. In “On The Origin of Species”, Darwin also carries out such an analysis. We know that Lenin analyses “many contradictions” together and in relation to each other in many of his works such as “Imperialism”, “Socialism and War”, “The Right of Peoples to Self-Determination”, and that Stalin deals with “many contradictions” in almost all his works, especially in “Problems of Leninism”. What Mao is actually doing here is expanding the theoretical vocabulary of dialectical materialist philosophy to include this characteristic of “every complex thing”.
 </p>
<p>
  Mao begins the construction of the theory by stating that the concept of contradiction is the sole essence of philosophy, its fundamental law, its fundamental element that precedes all other categories. This conception is mainly held by Lenin, and Lenin emphasises that it must be developed further. Lenin says: “The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts (…) is the
  <em>
   essence
  </em>
  (one of the “essentials,” one of the principal, if not the principal, charactetistics or features) of dialectics…. The correctness of this aspect of the content of dialectics must be tested by the history of science” (Philosophical Notebooks, p. 357).
 </p>
<p>
  When Lenin states that this topic is treated in various fields as a “collection of examples” but not as epistemology, he indicates that the topic should be treated from this point of view. It is clear from these statements that the chapter was written for this purpose. Mao’s treatment of the topic as “epistemology” and “law of cognition” is particularly significant in this respect.
 </p>
<p>
  One could say: “Even without this, we know that the dialectic is used to analyse both reality and knowledge. What then is the meaning of ‘special meaning’?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   DROPPING THE VEIL OF SECRECY
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  From the very beginning, the field of philosophy was a mystery to the masses. Although idealism dealt exclusively with the realm of knowledge, dialectics in the realm of concepts was not the main subject of materialism since it was formulated by Heraclitus, a naturalist, on the basis of “becoming”, “flow” and thus movement. Hegel held the view that the “universal spirit” was the only thing that had truth value, and even went so far as to say that it was “an inner being implanted in us by nature”. This is why Lenin adds the following to the statement “Intelligent idealism is closer to intelligent materialism than stupid materialism.”: “Dialectical idealism instead of intelligent; metaphysical, undeveloped, dead, crude, rigid instead of stupid.” Let us use the terms as Lenin suggests: “Dialectical idealism is closer to dialectical materialism than to metaphysical, undeveloped, dead, crude, inert materialism.” It was only in Hegel’s philosophy that the dialectical method deepened as a law of cognition. However, this was an entirely mystical use. Lenin states that Hegel’s philosophy is useless in this form. We know that Marx turned away from him, first approached Feurbach and in a short time also rejected him by writing the “Theses on Feurbach”.
 </p>
<p>
  The meeting of dialectics with materialism took place with the great step taken by Marx and Engels. From then on, materialism reached the stage of “intelligent materialism”, i.e. “dialectical materialism”. With this step, philosophy takes on a scientific character. The scientific method of investigation, the scientific method of thought, the scientific theory of knowledge became the means of human thought. This is also the inevitable consequence of the natural sciences, which had already reached a certain level by this time, were still developing and would develop even faster. It is also a product of the dynamics of the development of the new society, the capitalist society.
 </p>
<p>
  When Mao says: “The class struggle comes first”, he is not only referring to the philosophy of Marxism, but also to the role of the class struggle and the natural sciences in the development of philosophy as a whole.
 </p>
<p>
  “For a long period in history … [metaphysics], which is part and parcel of the idealist world outlook, occupied a dominant position in human thought. In Europe, the materialism of the bourgeoisie in its early days was also metaphysical. As the social economy of many European countries advanced to the stage of highly developed capitalism, as the forces of production, the class struggle and the sciences developed to a level unprecedented in history, and as the industrial proletariat became the greatest motive force in historical development, there arose the Marxist world outlook of materialist dialectics. Then, in addition to open and barefaced reactionary idealism, vulgar evolutionism emerged among the bourgeoisie to oppose materialist dialectics.” Ultimately, existence determines thought: the development of the productive forces, the class struggle and the sciences has brought philosophy from the “world of secrets” to the level of materialist dialectics, which is the way, the method, to arrive at knowledge of history, indeed of everything. At this point, we should refer to Mao’s statement that “he industrial proletariat became the greatest motive force in historical development”, which is certainly no coincidence. The fact that the industrial proletariat is propertyless and incapable of creating a new class society is the basis for its compatibility with the scientific structure of dialectical materialism. The relation of dialectical materialism to the industrial proletariat is important for the end of the period of class struggles in history. This relationship must be particularly emphasised; it must be studied, understood and explained… It should be noted that Mao’s “transformation of philosophy into a weapon of the masses”, which we have often referred to in discussing his contributions to philosophy, is related to this.
 </p>
<p>
  Mao says: “This dialectical world outlook teaches us primarily how to observe and analyse the movement of opposites in different things and, on the basis of such analysis, to indicate the methods for resolving contradictions. It is therefore most important for us to understand the law of contradiction in things in a concrete way.” Finally, by “us” Mao means the communists, the leaders of the historical road on which the industrial proletariat marches, the proletarian vanguard that feeds on it, that relies on its movement… After explaining that dialectics teaches us to analyse the movement of contradictions and, on the basis of this analysis, to find methods to resolve the contradictions, Mao says that the most important thing is to understand the law of contradiction concretely. This is the basis of Mao’s contributions. Mao first made this clear in the essays “On Practice” and then in “On Contradiction”, thus completing the theory of the dialectical world view.
 </p>
<p>
  He explains the understanding of the law of contradiction in a concrete way through the abstract-concrete/general-specific/universal-typical relationship, which he establishes under the headings “universality of contradiction” and “specificity of contradiction”. This section of the essay “On Contradiction” contains the basic understanding of the “concrete understanding of contradiction”. We have already mentioned this several times and point out once again that all revolutions in history are to be understood as the result of concrete analyses of the respective social structures and that proletarian revolutions can only be realised through specific, country-specific strategies based on the “analysis of concrete conditions”. Concretely, no revolution is the same as another revolution, even if they are qualitatively the same. The universal reality of proletarian revolutions in no way negates the fact that these revolutions must be based on concrete analyses. The specificity in universality and the universality in specificity is the indispensable understanding of the dialectical worldview. Without this understanding, no reality can be understood. It can only be half understood, which is one of the forms of non-understanding.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CONCRETE
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  From this chapter onwards, Mao speaks of a “new” stage which the concrete analysis encounters and which he formulates for the first time. This “novelty” is the thesis of the existence of “many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing”. Indeed, there are many contradictions in all processes, unless one is dealing with a simple, isolated process. Scientists also have to deal with many contradictions when they analyse an event, a material process or a formation. By analysing each of these contradictions as far as possible, they try to understand or be able to understand the event, the material process or the formation. This inevitably applies to all analyses of social struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  We can say that this is finally Mao’s trademark in the field of philosophy. Having grasped the law of contradiction as the “essential essence” of dialectics, he turns to explaining the concrete role that contradiction plays in these processes, and at this point he turns away from the concept of “one contradiction” and focuses on the concept of “many contradictions”. From then on, he is concerned with understanding the role of the “many contradictions” in the process in question. Terms such as “basic contradiction”, “main contradiction”, “main contradictions”, “the predominant direction in the contradiction” are descriptions of these roles. The question of the “diversity of contradictions in the development process of a great cause” is one of the crucial questions in determining the programmes, principles and the path that the revolutions should take. Without this kind of analysis, it is impossible to understand and analyse revolutionary processes. This is because revolutions involve the resolution of many contradictions. Many contradictions in a social structure are either resolved or dissolved by revolutions. This phenomenon is the basis of Mao’s relationship to revolutions. His analysis of society involves identifying and analysing contradictions. He discusses class relations on the basis of contradictions and evaluates the relationship of each class to the revolution on the basis of social contradictions. This is the well-known class analysis. However, analysing class through philosophy, or perhaps better said, through epistemology, is a special form of Mao’s contribution to philosophy. This is clearly shown in the philosophical essay “On Contradiction”. After noting that of the many contradictions in a process, one contradiction determines or influences the others, Mao illustrates this relationship of contradictions by analysing the whole world as follows: “in capitalist society the two forces in contradiction, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, form the principal contradiction. The other contradictions, such as those between the remnant feudal class and the bourgeoisie, between the peasant petty bourgeoisie ant the bourgeoisie, between the proletariat and the peasant petty bourgeoisie, between the non-monopoly capitalists and the monopoly capitalists, between bourgeois democracy and bourgeois fascism, among the capitalist countries and between imperialism and the colonies, are all determined or influenced by this principal contradiction.” In capitalist society, that is, in the world society of our epoch, all other contradictions are determined or influenced by the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. This does not mean that everything or every contradiction results or exists from this contradiction. Of course, there are many contradictions that are the product and result of this contradiction. The contradictions between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie, between the bourgeoisie and bourgeois fascism, between monopoly capitalists and non-monopoly capitalists, between imperialism and the colonies are of this kind. However, the contradictions between the feudal remnants and the bourgeoisie or between the feudal remnants and the proletariat are contradictions from the continuation of the period before capitalist society. Nevertheless, the solution or resolution of any contradiction depends on the resolution of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. For this reason, Mao also emphasises the revolutionary role of the proletariat under the conditions of the existence of feudal remnants. He considers the elimination of the feudal remnants impossible without advancing on the path of the proletarian solution. This role of the principal contradiction in resolving the many contradictions in a social process is the fundamental role that dialectical materialists adopt as a principle in defining and analysing a process. For the World Proletarian Revolution, for example, the passage from Mao quoted above is fundamental. Mao’s devotion to the cause of the proletariat and his passion for the victory of socialism can be seen in this passage alone. Anyone who does not realise that the elimination of the feudal remnants requires the leadership of the proletariat, who in any way attributes this elimination to the bourgeoisie, is not a Maoist and does not understand the “role of the principal contradiction among many contradictions” of dialectical materialism.
 </p>
<p>
  When we claim this, we are often told: “You are not analysing concrete conditions, you are dogmatic”. Apart from citing concrete arguments, we must remind them that dialectical materialism is the scientific way and method of analysing reality. “The presence and role of the principal contradiction among many contradictions” is not an exceptional case but, on the contrary, a law that always applies and can be relied upon with complete confidence in any scientific analysis: “there is no doubt at all that at every stage in the development of a process, there is only one principal contradiction which plays the leading role. Hence, if in any process there are a number of contradictions, one of them must be the principal contradiction playing the leading and decisive role, while the rest occupy a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved. This is the method Marx taught us in his study of capitalist society. ” (Mao Zedong, On Contradiction).
 </p>
<p>
  Mao’s thesis “There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and at every stage in the development of a process there is a principal contradiction” is one of his fundamental contributions to philosophy. But that is not all. Another of Mao’s decisive contributions is his concept of “instability, inequality”. This was undoubtedly formulated before Marx, but ultimately it has been a principle of dialectical materialism ever since. Mao, however, raised this issue to the highest level. Not only does he argue that equilibrium does not exist, that it is temporary and relative, but he also distances himself from the search for equilibrium. He is fully aware that a Marxist can never strive for equilibrium. He understands the universality of contradiction as an infinite process and defines the finitude of each contradiction in its particularity. That is why he says that there can be no equilibrium in socialism and even more so in communism. In this respect, he appears as a revolutionary who constantly speaks of chaos, gives in to chaos and defends chaos. The essence, however, is the chaos in the processes themselves. Mao does not speak of the creation of chaos, but of the inevitability and continuity of chaos. The concept of “creation” is also at odds with materialism from the outset. The concepts of the materialist define reality.
 </p>
<p>
  Mao speaks of the instability of the two contradictory aspects of a contradiction as follows: “… in any given contradiction, whether principal or secondary, should the two contradictory aspects be treated as equal? Again, no. In any contradiction the development of the contradictory aspects is uneven. Sometimes they seem to be in equilibrium, which is however only temporary and relative, while unevenness is basic.”
 </p>
<p>
  Mao explains this instability and inequality through the “fierce” struggle between the two aspects of the contradiction. The determination and maintenance of the contradiction is the task of one of the two aspects, while the other aspect has the task of ensuring the end of the contradiction, its transition to a new stage. This is the case with all contradictions. Therefore, everything is destined for instability, for rupture. Mao showed this by explaining the characteristics of contradictory directions: “Of the two contradictory aspects, one must be principal and the other secondary. The principal aspect is the one playing the leading role in the contradiction. The nature of a thing is determined mainly by the principal aspect of a contradiction, the aspect which has gained the dominant position.”
 </p>
<p>
  “But this situation is not static; the principal and the non-principal aspects of a contradiction transform themselves into each other and the nature of the thing changes accordingly. In a given process or at a given stage in the development of a contradiction, A is the principal aspect and B is the non-principal aspect; at another stage or in another process the roles are reversed–a change determined by the extent of the increase or decrease in the force of each aspect in its struggle against the other in the course of the development of a thing. “
 </p>
<p>
  In view of all this, Mao said: “We often speak of ‘the new superseding the old’. The supersession of the old by the new is a general, eternal and inviolable law of the universe.”
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   LORD OF TURMOIL
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The general, eternal and non-negligible law of the universe also explains Mao’s relationship to complexity.
 </p>
<p>
  In his introduction to the collection of Mao’s “On Contradiction” and a series of other philosophical essays, Zizek describes Mao as a “Marxist Lord of Misrule”: “This is why, while setting in motion and secretly pulling the strings of the self-destructive carnival, Mao nonetheless remained exempted from its shifts: at no moment was there ever a serious threat that Stalin (or Mao) himself should be ritualistically deposed, treated as ‘yesterday a king, today a beggar’ – he was not the traditional Master, but the ‘Lord of Misrule’”.
 </p>
<p>
  It is partly true that Mao did not essentially receive the treatment that Stalin received from the Soviet leadership after him. We say “partly” because it must be remembered that Stalin was not suddenly treated like a “beggar of a king”. It is well known that the attack on Stalin began timidly, tentatively and secretly. The ominous resolution of the 20th Party Congress about him, about his time, was not made public for a long time. Despite the open hostility at the congress, both Khrushchev and Brezhnev continued to defend Stalin. It should also be remembered that Mao was essentially rejected by the leadership immediately after him, his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was completely negated, and his moves towards socialism were condemned as sectarianism. “Yesterday’s king, today’s beggar” is not directly the case, but it is to some extent the case in the governments of the countries concerned. However, this is not our subject. Our subject is the true meaning of the term “Lord of Misrule”…
 </p>
<p>
  For many of us, this term is associated with first-hand contempt. The reign of chaos is a status based in the carnival on the idea that “it was customary for great households to choose a ‘Lord of Misrule.’ The person chosen was expected to preside over the revels that briefly reversed or parodied the conventional social and economic hierarchies. /…/When the brief reign of misrule was over, the customary order of things would be restored: the Lords of Misrule would go back to their menial occupations”. A status explained by Mao’s “inexhaustible evilness”… To call Mao the “Lord of Misrule” is indeed appropriate in an inverted reading. He is indeed a Marxist who masters chaos, who explains chaos, as all Marxists do…. As we have tried to explain above, Mao is someone who argues that instability and inequality are essential, that reality contains many contradictions, and that contradictions can never remain in equilibrium, even when they appear to be in equilibrium. This is not a situation that he “wants”, but reality itself. Mao is a materialist. His essay “On Practice” is a declaration of this identity. Reality is, to use the terms above, “the process of development of a complex thing”. “There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing”. The instability and disparity of contradictions explains that every great process is “chaos”. Mao sees reality as chaos. But this chaos can be recognised, analysed and mastered by the consciousness thus created. “Overcoming” can never take the form of stabilising and ending chaos. That contradicts the nature of things. This would be a subjectivist definition resulting from a lack of understanding or a sectarian interpretation of reality. Mao is in favour of the truth, and that is the source of the “Lord of Misrule”. As Comrade Demirdag said: “Facts are revolutionary”. Mao Zedong’s philosophical theory of understanding reality and transforming it in a revolutionary direction offers enormous opportunities for people, especially the proletariat today.
 </p>
<p>
  In summary, Mao Zedong’s contribution to philosophy is the completion and theorisation of Marxist philosophy. This theory must be transferred to the consciousness of the masses. The ability to control chaos must be transferred to the masses. “When it awakens under the influence of the vanguard of the active historical army, consisting of the “best people,” who have learned the lessons of modern science, then the “ordinary people” will understand that their task consists in the radical reconstruction of society (NB)”. (Philosophical Notebooks, by Plekhanov on Chernyshevsky, p. 543)
 </p>
<p>
  It is an indisputable fact that Mao Zedong, as the last of the “best people who have learned the lessons of modern science”, was a unique revolutionary theorist who declared that the period of proletarian revolutions was the period of “turmoil”, that he was the greatest revolutionary, that of course in a communist society the revolutions would continue in completely different forms…

  Our Day of Struggle is a response to the lack of a solution to the demands for justice and repression!
 </h2>
<p>
  Next Monday begins our
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle in Defense of the Rights of the People
  </strong>
  , which will take place in a context of increased repression and criminalization against the popular movement in Oaxaca.
 </p>
<p>
  The chronology of aggressions against the people so far this year is as follows:
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
<br>
   16th of January.
  </br></strong>
  70 proletarian families from the neighborhood Revolución in the Port of Salina Cruz were assaulted by municipal police and the Navy while resisting the demolition of their homes initiated by the company in charge of the construction of the Inter-Oceanic Train.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   27th of January.
  </strong>
  In the midst of a joint operation, elements of the State Investigation Agency, State Police and National Guard raided the homes of 9 activists of the Civil Resistance-Mixtequilla, who were detained and transferred to the Tanivet prison; the following day the community was besieged by the National Guard and the Navy to prevent protests. Finally, on February 2, a control judge imposed the precautionary measure of justified pre-trial detention on the detainees.
 </p>
<p>

  This
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle in Defense of the Rights of the People
  </strong>
  is a response to the lack of a solution to our demands for justice and also to the repression that seems to want to consolidate in the state under the discourse of the “Oaxacan spring”. It is evident that the big bourgeoisie, through the governments of the self-proclaimed 4T, wants to impose its vision of “peace” by co-opting, demobilizing and repressing the popular movement.

 The documentary on the Pan-Hellenic course on 8/3 of 2007, the day of the Giannakou Framework Law, gave the trigger for discussion of the similarities of the movement at the time now, as next Friday 8/3, just 17 years later, is The voting of the N/S for private universities is scheduled. Mr. Kamaretsos, a '06-'07 movement, gave his images and data at the time, and especially from the historical course of 2007, while questions and interventions were asked by young and old fighters. The need to continue the fight until the law was overthrown and the debate ended with a call for participation in the Pan -Hellenic Athens demonstration on Friday.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The
 Question – and this a most pertinent question – on the minds of the 
Revolutionary Communists of Nepal is that of the conditions of Nepal: 
whether Nepal remains a semi-feudal society, with semi-feudal relations 
of production, or whether Nepal has been transformed into a capitalist 
society. Whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution has been completed 
or not. Whether the superstructure of society too has been transformed 
or whether the consciousness of the masses remains feudal or whether 
this has been sublated by a neoliberal consciousness that is found 
amongst the masses of the imperialist countries. The latter being just 
as essential in the analysis, since we understand consciousness to be a 
reflection of material reality, thus, a capitalist mindset would be 
indicative of a capitalist nature in society. This is the question that 
faces the revolutionaries of Nepal; it is necessary to have a correct 
stance on this issue
   </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    .
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    It is 
necessary, first, to make clear what is meant exactly by the terms 
‘capitalism’ and ‘semi-feudalism’. After all, no such evaluation about 
the relations of production or the nature of society generally, can be 
conducted, without making clear what is meant by these terms. Firstly, 
it must be understood what is meant by capitalism, though a detailed 
analysis of the precise mechanisms of capitalism would take a 
dissertation of over a thousand pages (such a thing already exists, 
Capital); what capitalism is can be understood with a degree of 
exactitude without requiring such a dissertation. Capitalism is a mode 
of production and appropriation with the following characteristics:
   </span>
</p>
<div class="in__between_ads">
<div class="row">
</div>
</div>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Private ownership over the means of production by the bourgeoisie
    </span>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Generalized commodity production
    </span>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Wage labor as the primary labor process of society
    </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Next, it
 is important to explain what semi-feudalism is, and how it differs from
 feudalism. To do this, it is necessary, first, to define feudalism. 
Feudalism is a mode of production and appropriation, just like 
capitalism, with the following characteristics:
   </span>
</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Land ownership and thereby wealth in concentrated in the hands of a landlord class
    </span>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     Means of Production are owned by a landless peasant class who work and live on the land, but do not own it
    </span>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     The surplus produced by the peasants are paid to the landlord as rents
    </span>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Within a
 feudal society, the primary antagonism is that between the landlord 
class and peasant class, however, this is not the only antagonism. There
 also exist antagonisms between the landlord and nascent the 
bourgeoisie. The existence of this nascent bourgeoisie and a 
corresponding nascent class of wage laborers shows us how there exists 
the embryo of capitalist society within feudal society. Through 
successive processes of primitive accumulation and finally the hammer 
blow against feudalism – the bourgeois-democratic revolution – can this 
germ of capitalist society blossom and develop into mature capitalism. 
Semi-feudalism, thus, can be said to be the condition where the germ of 
capitalist society has undergone some development within feudal society;
 yet feudal conditions have not totally been swept away by the 
bourgeois-democratic revolution; where the landlord class still clings 
on to a great deal of power.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
    General Development Out of Feudalism in Nepal:
   </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In 
Nepal, until the 50s of the previous century, the laboring masses of 
peasants were crushed under the heel of the Rana Autocracy. This form 
however did not suit feudalism, and there existed a contradiction 
between the various feudal lords, particularly between the House of Shah
 and the House of Rana. The Ranas, to strengthen their position, made 
various agreements with the British Imperialists allowing for the flow 
of British finance capital to Nepal, this led to the birth of 
semi-colonial conditions in Nepal; where, Nepal maintained nominal 
independence but was effectively a colony of the British Imperialists. 
One instance of this is Clause 6 of the Nepal-Britain Treaty of 1923, 
which stated “
   </span>
<i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
     No Customs duty 
shall be levied at British Indian ports on goods imported on behalf of 
the Nepal Government for immediate transport to that country(…)
    </span>
</i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    ”;
 this clause effectively allowed Britain to export British commodities 
and British finance capital to Nepal freely, and is one instance of the 
unequal treaties made by the feudal state. This is an early expression 
of the continued suppression of the Nepali National Bourgeoisie, as this
 treaty effectively allowed the British to outcompete Nepali enterprise 
and strengthen British monopoly finance capital.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Yet in 
the end, the British imperialists abandoned the Ranas and the 
contradictions between the landlords swiftly bubbled to the surface. 
These then finally erupted into a qualitative development in 1950. 
Where, one segment of the landlord class, represented by the House of 
Shah allied with the petite-bourgeoisie and haute bourgeoisie, 
represented by the Nepali Congress, along with the proletariat and 
peasants represented by the Nepali Communist Party; led a struggle 
against the more reactionary segment of the landlords led by the House 
of Rana. After the victory of this struggle, the landlord class had to 
make various concessions to the bourgeoisie, this led to a definite 
transformation of the conditions of Nepal from feudal to semi-feudal.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Some of 
these concessions, particularly political concessions made to the 
bourgeoisie, however, were chipped away by the landlord class. At this 
time, the landlords were the masters of this society, thus, Nepal was 
principally semi-feudal. The contradictions between the various aspects 
of society, but principally, the contradiction between the landlords and
 bourgeoisie, continued to deepen and intensify at this time. Many 
developments occurred during the subsequent decades. The condition of 
the Nepali Communist Movement became fractured and split. The two 
principal lines, the two banners carried by sections of the communist 
movement became: The banner of electoralism, parliamentarism and 
royalism upheld by those revisionists that would constitute the CPN 
(UML); the banner of revolution and smashing of the dictatorship of the 
compradors and landlords was upheld by those Marxists that would 
constitute the CPN (Maoist). The Revisionist Social Fascists then 
degenerated into the most stalwart defenders of the feudal system and 
the monarchy, the nucleus of this system.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In this 
period, the rising bourgeoisie, which could not unleash its productive 
potential under the dictatorship of the landlords, began to prepare by 
developing its strength and biding its time. In this time, the 
bourgeoisie were making preparations for their struggle with the feudal 
lords, they continued operating within the constricting semi-feudal 
relations imposed Panchayat system, which was the effective domination 
of the landlord classes, and their primacy. Nepal, at this time too, was
 both semi-feudal and semi-colonial, but the semi-feudal aspect was the 
principal oppression. However, the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie did 
not find this condition acceptable, and this led to a deepening of the 
contradictions between the two ruling classes.
    <span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<p>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    This 
contradiction erupted into the “People’s Movement” of 1990, which was a 
struggle of the compradors against the landlords. The compradors 
temporarily allied themselves with the petite bourgeoisie, peasants, and
 proletariat against the landlords; the landlord class gave further 
concessions to the comprador bourgeoisie, leading to a more egalitarian 
division of power amongst the pre-existing class dictatorship. At this 
time, the landlords were still the principal aspect of the class 
dictatorship of the landlord and comprador/bureaucrat classes. The 
antagonism between the proletariat, peasants, petite bourgeoisie and 
national bourgeoisie on the one hand and the landlord, 
comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie on the other throughout this period 
sharply intensified. This intensification continued as the masses of 
people who trusted the comprador bourgeoisie to lead genuine change 
during the “People’s Movement” were promptly betrayed; as the ruling 
classes consolidated their own position and continued the wholesale 
exploitation of the oppressed classes. These developments and others led
 to a qualitative leap, a transformation made possible by the masses as 
the motive force of history, with their revolutionary wrath, being honed
 and strengthened by the revolutionary vanguard party. The revolution 
had begun.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The 
various successes and progressive developments made during the 
revolutionary period are far outside the scope of this piece. The main 
point, however, is that the New Democratic Revolution – the 
bourgeois-democratic and anti-imperialist revolution – was betrayed by 
the revisionists and renegades within the party. The New Democratic 
revolution was left incomplete, and the renegades fused the degenerated 
party with the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeois establishment. In this 
situation, can it be said that semi-feudalism was swept away? Can it be 
proclaimed, as some would wish to proclaim, that “The Revolution has 
eradicated semi-feudalism and established a democratic republic!” (the 
concept of “the democratic republic” being yet another revisionist 
daydream)? Absolutely not! The revolution was betrayed, stabbed in the 
back and the dreams of emancipation by the oppressed masses murdered by 
the revisionists and renegades, by those who have now developed Nepali 
Social Fascism to a new higher level (Prachanda Path). And without the 
revolution negating semi-feudalism, are we to believe that 
semi-feudalism eroded and died on its own? How can such a thing be when 
we understand struggle to be the basic motive force of history, without a
 violent eradication of semi-feudalism, without the bourgeois-democratic
 revolution, how can semi-feudalism simply vanish?! The reality is that 
semi-feudalism has not vanished, but rather its manifestation has simply
 transformed!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    The 
fusion of the renegades with the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie 
strengthened their position and caused a qualitative transformation in 
the nature of the Nepali State, previously, semi-feudalism had been the 
principal aspect, now, semi-colonialism became the principal aspect. 
With this weakening – though not eradication – of semi-feudalism, the 
landlord class took on a submissive role to the comprador/bureaucrat 
bourgeoisie. The hitherto open exploitation by the landlord class took 
on a covert character, and the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie took 
over the primary reins of the state. This however does not mean that the
 contradiction between the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie and the 
landlords has ended – far from it – the continual unity and struggle of 
these classes are what shapes Nepali society and the Nepali state. 
However, these classes are united in their exploitation of the oppressed
 classes, which is why it is necessary to smash their class dictatorship
 and establish a revolutionary state following the new democratic 
revolution.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
    Analysis of Present Conditions:
   </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    With 
that established, however, it is nevertheless necessary to see how the 
objective conditions of Nepal to this day remain semi-feudal and how 
this may not always remain the case. The first development that is 
gradually eroding the semi-feudal conditions of Nepal is continued 
primitive accumulation. This process of primitive accumulation, what 
Marx compared to “original sin” is the first process which leads to the 
birth of mature capitalism from its embryonic state in the womb of 
feudalism. This embryonic capitalism in the womb of feudalism, has in 
the dependent nations been assimilated with imperialist monopoly finance
 capital, which in truth hinders the development of a national 
capitalism. The germ of mature national capitalism which has assimilated
 with imperialist monopoly finance capital has, through the process of 
primitive accumulation, synthesized itself into a higher stage of 
development; yet it is still in its embryonic stage within the soil of 
feudalism yet to germinate. However, to some extent, this process of 
germination has already commenced.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    For 
instance, during the process of primitive accumulation, it is known that
 due to the enclosure of land the hitherto landless yet not wholly 
desolate peasant class forcefully evicted from the lands where they had 
resided; is violently transformed into the industrial proletariat to 
meet the needs of the bourgeoisie. This mass proletarianization not 
merely meets the needs of the developing bourgeoisie of the urban 
centers, but also exceeds these demands, thus creating a reserve army of
 the proletariat. We are seeing precisely this process carry out in 
Nepal. Those that had hitherto lived as landless peasants or owners of 
small plots of land are being violently, due to various circumstances, 
forced out of their villages in droves. This process of 
proletarianization is proven by the mass urbanization experienced in 
Nepal, as people are being forced to migrate to cities in droves in 
search of jobs. Thus is created a new proletariat to meet the needs of 
this amalgam of monopoly finance capital and the germ of national 
capital. The peasants of Nepal are being transformed into an army of 
wage slaves to meet the needs of the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In spite
 of this, semi-feudal relations of production– between the peasants and 
landlords– remain prevalent. To this day, one and a half million 
households, are landless forced to live on the lands of landlords and 
work that land and pay rents to the landed aristocracy. To this day, the
 system of feudal oppression continues, though due to processes such as 
primitive accumulation, this feudal oppression is being sublated by a 
new, capitalist exploitation. This feudal oppression still continues, 
and millions continue to suffer under this system. The promise to 
redistribute land to the peasants have not been met by any of the 
so-called “Socialists” in power, for in truth their vacant words mean 
nothing. They, in the final analysis, represent the landlord class, and 
thus would not enact any policy or uphold any line that causes grievance
 to their landlord masters.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Thus, 
there is still a large class of peasants, and a class of landlords that 
oppresses these peasants. Hence, the primary antagonism of feudal 
society, the antagonism between the peasants and the landlord class, 
still exists and is still strong. This shows that the semi-feudal mode 
of production and appropriation still exists and still holds primacy in 
Nepali society.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Another 
important point of analysis is an analysis of the political and 
ideological superstructure. As materialists, we know that in the final 
analysis, the base shapes the superstructure; meaning that the 
structural and cultural hegemony of the ruling class would be reflected 
onto the superstructure on a micro and macro level. The individual is 
interpellated into a subject for and by ideology, to act as a reproducer
 of said ideology and participate in this ideology. It is through a 
sharp analysis of ideology, of the pure ideology that comprises the 
“common sense” looked on by society, that we can begin a dissection of 
the nature of the superstructure.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    To 
begin, it is necessary to look at the basic Ideological State 
Apparatuses which comprise the non-repressive aspect of the 
superstructure, namely: the family, education, and the media. The 
family, has, in recent decades, been transformed from an institution 
where relations in the family built on love, affection, and mutual 
compassion have been replaced by money-relations. Through this process –
 which is really a reflection of the aforementioned primitive 
accumulation and the rising primacy of monopoly finance capital 
reflected onto the sphere of culture and ideology (the superstructure) –
 it can be seen that the growth of capitalism is slowly leading to the 
decay of semi-feudal familial relations. An analysis of education must 
be divided into two questions, ‘who is doing the educating?’ and ‘what 
is being educated?’. The answer to the first question is the haute 
bourgeoisie: schools, colleges, and universities have become the domain 
of the haute bourgeois class; they have transformed education into a 
business-model operated by certain syndicates. This educational 
syndicate is precisely the natural result of market meddling in 
education. The answer to the second question is that ideology is being 
taught through education, ideology which conditions people not to 
question the status quo to blindly accept dictates from above; 
primarily, this is capitalist ideology. Lastly, the media is owned by 
the haute bourgeoisie and funded through advertisement by them. The 
media uses “credible” and “respected” bourgeois sources to shape the 
Overton window, such that radical ideas are wholly discredited and 
ruling class stances are brought to the fore.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    This may
 lead one to conclude that the superstructure is an apparatus through 
which the haute bourgeoisie exercise their hegemony and reproduce the 
ideology that justifies their hegemony, in turn reproducing capitalist 
relations of production. But this would be a hasty conclusion to draw! 
First, this bourgeois hegemony does not necessarily dispel the notion of
 Nepal being semi-feudal, since, this could be — and likely is — the 
result of the growing primacy of imperialist monopoly finance capital; 
this, by virtue of its nature has greater sway over the superstructure 
and is thus has a superior ability to reproduce itself. The imperialists
 and compradors have a greater ability to exert their hegemony through 
the superstructure by virtue of the resources they have at their 
disposal vis-à-vis the landlord class. So, this merely strengthens the 
assertion that Nepal is semi-colonial and does not dispel the assertion 
that it is semi-feudal! It is also undeniably true that internationally,
 due to their position as the primary superpower, the Yankee 
imperialists have been able to export their monopoly finance capital; 
this also invariably results in the export of Yankee idealist-liberal 
ideology and culture. This too is simply being manifested in Nepal.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Next, we
 understand the state to be the highest manifestation of the 
superstructure, and the state is the military-bureaucratic apparatus by 
which the ruling class enforces its class dictatorship. It is clear that
 this apparatus is still strongly in the pockets of the landlord class. 
In the military, many top generals and leader have served for the openly
 semi-feudal state led by the Shah Autocracy, and they continue to lead 
the military apparatus. Also, in the bureaucracy, many bureaucrats 
ranging from municipal secretaries to the top parties in parliament have
 a history of being in cahoots with the feudal autocracy. The parties, 
like the Nepali Congress and NCP (UML) have in the past acted as a 
shield deflecting the masses’ ire away from their oppression under the 
autocracy, and now they continue to do so covertly.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    Lastly, 
in spite of the structural hegemony of the capitalists, the ideology, 
and consciousness of the people is still shaped by semi-feudalism. The 
demands for a return to monarchy, and a return to a more reactionary 
state of affairs, makes explicit the real semi-feudal conditions of 
society. After all, consciousness is shaped by material conditions, and 
semi-feudal consciousness suggests semi-feudal conditions.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
    Conclusion:
   </strong>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    In the 
final analysis, it is clear to see that Nepal is semi-feudal, 
semi-colonial in nature; semi-colonialism being the principal aspect. 
The seeming capitalist manifestations in Nepal are caused by the flow of
 monopoly finance capital to Nepal, and its assimilation with embryonic 
national capital; imperialist monopoly capital, like a leech, drains the
 vitality of the embryonic national capital of Nepal, hindering the 
development of a national capitalism. Imperialist monopoly finance 
capital is also in-bed with the national oppressors, mainly the landlord
 class. The seeming growth of capitalism in Nepal is an aberration from 
the laws of sociohistorical development; this is because the seeming 
growth of capitalism is actually the growth of a foreign born tumor: 
monopoly finance capital. Nepal remains largely semi-feudal, however, 
due to processes set in motion by this imperialist monopoly capital, the
 semi-feudal order is every day nearing its demise.
   </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">
    This 
intensifying contradiction between national capitalism on the one hand; 
and, semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism on the other; shall, through 
successive developments, lead to the inevitable qualitative leap forward
 of New Democratic Revolution. Feudalism feels threatened, which is why 
it retreats into greater reaction and chauvinism, as highlighted by the 
rise of Durga Prasai. Feudalism’s natural retreat into reaction shows 
how quantitative developments toward its abolition are being made in 
ever greater strides. Revolution is inevitable.

  On Saturday, March 2, Palestine North Jutland held a powerful demonstration to support the Palestinian people. The demonstration was just one of many demonstrations across the country under the main title "All of Denmark on the streets of Palestine". The demonstration started in front of the station building and continued down to Toldbods Plads, during the demonstration, powerful slogans were constantly shouted to support Palestine.
