Whether the bourgeois-democratic revolution has been completed \nor not. Whether the superstructure of society too has been transformed \nor whether the consciousness of the masses remains feudal or whether \nthis has been sublated by a neoliberal consciousness that is found \namongst the masses of the imperialist countries. The latter being just \nas essential in the analysis, since we understand consciousness to be a \nreflection of material reality, thus, a capitalist mindset would be \nindicative of a capitalist nature in society. This is the question that \nfaces the revolutionaries of Nepal; it is necessary to have a correct \nstance on this issue\n   </span>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    .\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    It is \nnecessary, first, to make clear what is meant exactly by the terms \n\u2018capitalism\u2019 and \u2018semi-feudalism\u2019. After all, no such evaluation about \nthe relations of production or the nature of society generally, can be \nconducted, without making clear what is meant by these terms. Firstly, \nit must be understood what is meant by capitalism, though a detailed \nanalysis of the precise mechanisms of capitalism would take a \ndissertation of over a thousand pages (such a thing already exists, \nCapital); what capitalism is can be understood with a degree of \nexactitude without requiring such a dissertation. Capitalism is a mode \nof production and appropriation with the following characteristics:\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"in__between_ads\">\n   <div class=\"row\">\n   </div>\n  </div>\n  <ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     Private ownership over the means of production by the bourgeoisie\n    </span>\n   </li>\n   <li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     Generalized commodity production\n    </span>\n   </li>\n   <li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     Wage labor as the primary labor process of society\n    </span>\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Next, it\n is important to explain what semi-feudalism is, and how it differs from\n feudalism. To do this, it is necessary, first, to define feudalism. \nFeudalism is a mode of production and appropriation, just like \ncapitalism, with the following characteristics:\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <ol style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     Land ownership and thereby wealth in concentrated in the hands of a landlord class\n    </span>\n   </li>\n   <li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     Means of Production are owned by a landless peasant class who work and live on the land, but do not own it\n    </span>\n   </li>\n   <li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     The surplus produced by the peasants are paid to the landlord as rents\n    </span>\n   </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Within a\n feudal society, the primary antagonism is that between the landlord \nclass and peasant class, however, this is not the only antagonism. There\n also exist antagonisms between the landlord and nascent the \nbourgeoisie. The existence of this nascent bourgeoisie and a \ncorresponding nascent class of wage laborers shows us how there exists \nthe embryo of capitalist society within feudal society. Through \nsuccessive processes of primitive accumulation and finally the hammer \nblow against feudalism \u2013 the bourgeois-democratic revolution \u2013 can this \ngerm of capitalist society blossom and develop into mature capitalism. \nSemi-feudalism, thus, can be said to be the condition where the germ of \ncapitalist society has undergone some development within feudal society;\n yet feudal conditions have not totally been swept away by the \nbourgeois-democratic revolution; where the landlord class still clings \non to a great deal of power.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-39037 lazy-loaded\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-src=\"https://moolbato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/163-1639521_thinking-statue-png-david-thinking-statue.png\" data-srcset=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://moolbato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/163-1639521_thinking-statue-png-david-thinking-statue.png\" srcset=\"https://moolbato.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/163-1639521_thinking-statue-png-david-thinking-statue.png\" width=\"315\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <strong>\n    General Development Out of Feudalism in Nepal:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    In \nNepal, until the 50s of the previous century, the laboring masses of \npeasants were crushed under the heel of the Rana Autocracy. This form \nhowever did not suit feudalism, and there existed a contradiction \nbetween the various feudal lords, particularly between the House of Shah\n and the House of Rana. The Ranas, to strengthen their position, made \nvarious agreements with the British Imperialists allowing for the flow \nof British finance capital to Nepal, this led to the birth of \nsemi-colonial conditions in Nepal; where, Nepal maintained nominal \nindependence but was effectively a colony of the British Imperialists. \nOne instance of this is Clause 6 of the Nepal-Britain Treaty of 1923, \nwhich stated \u201c\n   </span>\n   <i>\n    <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n     No Customs duty \nshall be levied at British Indian ports on goods imported on behalf of \nthe Nepal Government for immediate transport to that country(\u2026)\n    </span>\n   </i>\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    \u201d;\n this clause effectively allowed Britain to export British commodities \nand British finance capital to Nepal freely, and is one instance of the \nunequal treaties made by the feudal state. This is an early expression \nof the continued suppression of the Nepali National Bourgeoisie, as this\n treaty effectively allowed the British to outcompete Nepali enterprise \nand strengthen British monopoly finance capital.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Yet in \nthe end, the British imperialists abandoned the Ranas and the \ncontradictions between the landlords swiftly bubbled to the surface. \nThese then finally erupted into a qualitative development in 1950. \nWhere, one segment of the landlord class, represented by the House of \nShah allied with the petite-bourgeoisie and haute bourgeoisie, \nrepresented by the Nepali Congress, along with the proletariat and \npeasants represented by the Nepali Communist Party; led a struggle \nagainst the more reactionary segment of the landlords led by the House \nof Rana. After the victory of this struggle, the landlord class had to \nmake various concessions to the bourgeoisie, this led to a definite \ntransformation of the conditions of Nepal from feudal to semi-feudal.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Some of \nthese concessions, particularly political concessions made to the \nbourgeoisie, however, were chipped away by the landlord class. At this \ntime, the landlords were the masters of this society, thus, Nepal was \nprincipally semi-feudal. The contradictions between the various aspects \nof society, but principally, the contradiction between the landlords and\n bourgeoisie, continued to deepen and intensify at this time. Many \ndevelopments occurred during the subsequent decades. The condition of \nthe Nepali Communist Movement became fractured and split. The two \nprincipal lines, the two banners carried by sections of the communist \nmovement became: The banner of electoralism, parliamentarism and \nroyalism upheld by those revisionists that would constitute the CPN \n(UML); the banner of revolution and smashing of the dictatorship of the \ncompradors and landlords was upheld by those Marxists that would \nconstitute the CPN (Maoist). The Revisionist Social Fascists then \ndegenerated into the most stalwart defenders of the feudal system and \nthe monarchy, the nucleus of this system.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    In this \nperiod, the rising bourgeoisie, which could not unleash its productive \npotential under the dictatorship of the landlords, began to prepare by \ndeveloping its strength and biding its time. In this time, the \nbourgeoisie were making preparations for their struggle with the feudal \nlords, they continued operating within the constricting semi-feudal \nrelations imposed Panchayat system, which was the effective domination \nof the landlord classes, and their primacy. Nepal, at this time too, was\n both semi-feudal and semi-colonial, but the semi-feudal aspect was the \nprincipal oppression. However, the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie did \nnot find this condition acceptable, and this led to a deepening of the \ncontradictions between the two ruling classes.\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <a name=\"more\">\n  </a>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    This \ncontradiction erupted into the \u201cPeople\u2019s Movement\u201d of 1990, which was a \nstruggle of the compradors against the landlords. The compradors \ntemporarily allied themselves with the petite bourgeoisie, peasants, and\n proletariat against the landlords; the landlord class gave further \nconcessions to the comprador bourgeoisie, leading to a more egalitarian \ndivision of power amongst the pre-existing class dictatorship. At this \ntime, the landlords were still the principal aspect of the class \ndictatorship of the landlord and comprador/bureaucrat classes. The \nantagonism between the proletariat, peasants, petite bourgeoisie and \nnational bourgeoisie on the one hand and the landlord, \ncomprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie on the other throughout this period \nsharply intensified. This intensification continued as the masses of \npeople who trusted the comprador bourgeoisie to lead genuine change \nduring the \u201cPeople\u2019s Movement\u201d were promptly betrayed; as the ruling \nclasses consolidated their own position and continued the wholesale \nexploitation of the oppressed classes. These developments and others led\n to a qualitative leap, a transformation made possible by the masses as \nthe motive force of history, with their revolutionary wrath, being honed\n and strengthened by the revolutionary vanguard party. The revolution \nhad begun.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    The \nvarious successes and progressive developments made during the \nrevolutionary period are far outside the scope of this piece. The main \npoint, however, is that the New Democratic Revolution \u2013 the \nbourgeois-democratic and anti-imperialist revolution \u2013 was betrayed by \nthe revisionists and renegades within the party. The New Democratic \nrevolution was left incomplete, and the renegades fused the degenerated \nparty with the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeois establishment. In this \nsituation, can it be said that semi-feudalism was swept away? Can it be \nproclaimed, as some would wish to proclaim, that \u201cThe Revolution has \neradicated semi-feudalism and established a democratic republic!\u201d (the \nconcept of \u201cthe democratic republic\u201d being yet another revisionist \ndaydream)? Absolutely not! The revolution was betrayed, stabbed in the \nback and the dreams of emancipation by the oppressed masses murdered by \nthe revisionists and renegades, by those who have now developed Nepali \nSocial Fascism to a new higher level (Prachanda Path). And without the \nrevolution negating semi-feudalism, are we to believe that \nsemi-feudalism eroded and died on its own? How can such a thing be when \nwe understand struggle to be the basic motive force of history, without a\n violent eradication of semi-feudalism, without the bourgeois-democratic\n revolution, how can semi-feudalism simply vanish?! The reality is that \nsemi-feudalism has not vanished, but rather its manifestation has simply\n transformed!\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    The \nfusion of the renegades with the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie \nstrengthened their position and caused a qualitative transformation in \nthe nature of the Nepali State, previously, semi-feudalism had been the \nprincipal aspect, now, semi-colonialism became the principal aspect. \nWith this weakening \u2013 though not eradication \u2013 of semi-feudalism, the \nlandlord class took on a submissive role to the comprador/bureaucrat \nbourgeoisie. The hitherto open exploitation by the landlord class took \non a covert character, and the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie took \nover the primary reins of the state. This however does not mean that the\n contradiction between the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie and the \nlandlords has ended \u2013 far from it \u2013 the continual unity and struggle of \nthese classes are what shapes Nepali society and the Nepali state. \nHowever, these classes are united in their exploitation of the oppressed\n classes, which is why it is necessary to smash their class dictatorship\n and establish a revolutionary state following the new democratic \nrevolution.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-58182 lazy-loaded\" data-lazy-type=\"image\" data-src=\"https://moolbato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Marx-Lenin.webp\" data-srcset=\"\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://moolbato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Marx-Lenin.webp\" srcset=\"https://moolbato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Marx-Lenin.webp\" width=\"400\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis of Present Conditions:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    With \nthat established, however, it is nevertheless necessary to see how the \nobjective conditions of Nepal to this day remain semi-feudal and how \nthis may not always remain the case. The first development that is \ngradually eroding the semi-feudal conditions of Nepal is continued \nprimitive accumulation. This process of primitive accumulation, what \nMarx compared to \u201coriginal sin\u201d is the first process which leads to the \nbirth of mature capitalism from its embryonic state in the womb of \nfeudalism. This embryonic capitalism in the womb of feudalism, has in \nthe dependent nations been assimilated with imperialist monopoly finance\n capital, which in truth hinders the development of a national \ncapitalism. The germ of mature national capitalism which has assimilated\n with imperialist monopoly finance capital has, through the process of \nprimitive accumulation, synthesized itself into a higher stage of \ndevelopment; yet it is still in its embryonic stage within the soil of \nfeudalism yet to germinate. However, to some extent, this process of \ngermination has already commenced.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    For \ninstance, during the process of primitive accumulation, it is known that\n due to the enclosure of land the hitherto landless yet not wholly \ndesolate peasant class forcefully evicted from the lands where they had \nresided; is violently transformed into the industrial proletariat to \nmeet the needs of the bourgeoisie. This mass proletarianization not \nmerely meets the needs of the developing bourgeoisie of the urban \ncenters, but also exceeds these demands, thus creating a reserve army of\n the proletariat. We are seeing precisely this process carry out in \nNepal. Those that had hitherto lived as landless peasants or owners of \nsmall plots of land are being violently, due to various circumstances, \nforced out of their villages in droves. This process of \nproletarianization is proven by the mass urbanization experienced in \nNepal, as people are being forced to migrate to cities in droves in \nsearch of jobs. Thus is created a new proletariat to meet the needs of \nthis amalgam of monopoly finance capital and the germ of national \ncapital. The peasants of Nepal are being transformed into an army of \nwage slaves to meet the needs of the comprador/bureaucrat bourgeoisie.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    In spite\n of this, semi-feudal relations of production\u2013 between the peasants and \nlandlords\u2013 remain prevalent. To this day, one and a half million \nhouseholds, are landless forced to live on the lands of landlords and \nwork that land and pay rents to the landed aristocracy. To this day, the\n system of feudal oppression continues, though due to processes such as \nprimitive accumulation, this feudal oppression is being sublated by a \nnew, capitalist exploitation. This feudal oppression still continues, \nand millions continue to suffer under this system. The promise to \nredistribute land to the peasants have not been met by any of the \nso-called \u201cSocialists\u201d in power, for in truth their vacant words mean \nnothing. They, in the final analysis, represent the landlord class, and \nthus would not enact any policy or uphold any line that causes grievance\n to their landlord masters.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Thus, \nthere is still a large class of peasants, and a class of landlords that \noppresses these peasants. Hence, the primary antagonism of feudal \nsociety, the antagonism between the peasants and the landlord class, \nstill exists and is still strong. This shows that the semi-feudal mode \nof production and appropriation still exists and still holds primacy in \nNepali society.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Another \nimportant point of analysis is an analysis of the political and \nideological superstructure. As materialists, we know that in the final \nanalysis, the base shapes the superstructure; meaning that the \nstructural and cultural hegemony of the ruling class would be reflected \nonto the superstructure on a micro and macro level. The individual is \ninterpellated into a subject for and by ideology, to act as a reproducer\n of said ideology and participate in this ideology. It is through a \nsharp analysis of ideology, of the pure ideology that comprises the \n\u201ccommon sense\u201d looked on by society, that we can begin a dissection of \nthe nature of the superstructure.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    To \nbegin, it is necessary to look at the basic Ideological State \nApparatuses which comprise the non-repressive aspect of the \nsuperstructure, namely: the family, education, and the media. The \nfamily, has, in recent decades, been transformed from an institution \nwhere relations in the family built on love, affection, and mutual \ncompassion have been replaced by money-relations. Through this process \u2013\n which is really a reflection of the aforementioned primitive \naccumulation and the rising primacy of monopoly finance capital \nreflected onto the sphere of culture and ideology (the superstructure) \u2013\n it can be seen that the growth of capitalism is slowly leading to the \ndecay of semi-feudal familial relations. An analysis of education must \nbe divided into two questions, \u2018who is doing the educating?\u2019 and \u2018what \nis being educated?\u2019. The answer to the first question is the haute \nbourgeoisie: schools, colleges, and universities have become the domain \nof the haute bourgeois class; they have transformed education into a \nbusiness-model operated by certain syndicates. This educational \nsyndicate is precisely the natural result of market meddling in \neducation. The answer to the second question is that ideology is being \ntaught through education, ideology which conditions people not to \nquestion the status quo to blindly accept dictates from above; \nprimarily, this is capitalist ideology. Lastly, the media is owned by \nthe haute bourgeoisie and funded through advertisement by them. The \nmedia uses \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201crespected\u201d bourgeois sources to shape the \nOverton window, such that radical ideas are wholly discredited and \nruling class stances are brought to the fore.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    This may\n lead one to conclude that the superstructure is an apparatus through \nwhich the haute bourgeoisie exercise their hegemony and reproduce the \nideology that justifies their hegemony, in turn reproducing capitalist \nrelations of production. But this would be a hasty conclusion to draw! \nFirst, this bourgeois hegemony does not necessarily dispel the notion of\n Nepal being semi-feudal, since, this could be \u2014 and likely is \u2014 the \nresult of the growing primacy of imperialist monopoly finance capital; \nthis, by virtue of its nature has greater sway over the superstructure \nand is thus has a superior ability to reproduce itself. The imperialists\n and compradors have a greater ability to exert their hegemony through \nthe superstructure by virtue of the resources they have at their \ndisposal vis-\u00e0-vis the landlord class. So, this merely strengthens the \nassertion that Nepal is semi-colonial and does not dispel the assertion \nthat it is semi-feudal! It is also undeniably true that internationally,\n due to their position as the primary superpower, the Yankee \nimperialists have been able to export their monopoly finance capital; \nthis also invariably results in the export of Yankee idealist-liberal \nideology and culture. This too is simply being manifested in Nepal.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Next, we\n understand the state to be the highest manifestation of the \nsuperstructure, and the state is the military-bureaucratic apparatus by \nwhich the ruling class enforces its class dictatorship. It is clear that\n this apparatus is still strongly in the pockets of the landlord class. \nIn the military, many top generals and leader have served for the openly\n semi-feudal state led by the Shah Autocracy, and they continue to lead \nthe military apparatus. Also, in the bureaucracy, many bureaucrats \nranging from municipal secretaries to the top parties in parliament have\n a history of being in cahoots with the feudal autocracy. The parties, \nlike the Nepali Congress and NCP (UML) have in the past acted as a \nshield deflecting the masses\u2019 ire away from their oppression under the \nautocracy, and now they continue to do so covertly.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    Lastly, \nin spite of the structural hegemony of the capitalists, the ideology, \nand consciousness of the people is still shaped by semi-feudalism. The \ndemands for a return to monarchy, and a return to a more reactionary \nstate of affairs, makes explicit the real semi-feudal conditions of \nsociety. After all, consciousness is shaped by material conditions, and \nsemi-feudal consciousness suggests semi-feudal conditions.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    In the \nfinal analysis, it is clear to see that Nepal is semi-feudal, \nsemi-colonial in nature; semi-colonialism being the principal aspect. \nThe seeming capitalist manifestations in Nepal are caused by the flow of\n monopoly finance capital to Nepal, and its assimilation with embryonic \nnational capital; imperialist monopoly capital, like a leech, drains the\n vitality of the embryonic national capital of Nepal, hindering the \ndevelopment of a national capitalism. Imperialist monopoly finance \ncapital is also in-bed with the national oppressors, mainly the landlord\n class. The seeming growth of capitalism in Nepal is an aberration from \nthe laws of sociohistorical development; this is because the seeming \ngrowth of capitalism is actually the growth of a foreign born tumor: \nmonopoly finance capital. Nepal remains largely semi-feudal, however, \ndue to processes set in motion by this imperialist monopoly capital, the\n semi-feudal order is every day nearing its demise.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n   <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n    This \nintensifying contradiction between national capitalism on the one hand; \nand, semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism on the other; shall, through \nsuccessive developments, lead to the inevitable qualitative leap forward\n of New Democratic Revolution. Feudalism feels threatened, which is why \nit retreats into greater reaction and chauvinism, as highlighted by the \nrise of Durga Prasai. Feudalism\u2019s natural retreat into reaction shows \nhow quantitative developments toward its abolition are being made in \never greater strides. Revolution is inevitable.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "Nepal: Semi-Feudal or Capitalist?  \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t Kisan Maharjan  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t...", "author": ["maoistroad"], "source": "https://maoistroad.blogspot.com/2024/03/nepal-semi-feudal-or-capitalist-for.html"}
