   In Colombia, there are much who since their trade as actors, directors and playwrights have been restless, worried and dedicated to telling the stories suffered by the people. Some have been able to see plays as an act of memory about events that have marked the history of the people. Colombia has many plays about forced displacement, the war against the people at the hands of landowners and armed groups; And, in recent years, special works have been seen in the Colombian theater about the disappearance of the children of the people in the so -called "false positives."
  </p>
<p>
   For those creators, we extend a greeting on World Theater Day, and we greet all the artists of the performing arts that in one way or another dedicate their knowledge and experience to fight the battle against the oppressors, from the field of culture. This day, it is also a recognition of the dedicated work, sacrificed and patient that is done, even under precarious conditions in which the state of the capitalists more than culture more, to dedicate the treasury to the rescue of the bourgeoisie and from the war.
  </p>
<p>
   On this March 27, 2024, when shadow times are lived, it is necessary to remember the words expressed by the German author Bertolt Brecht on the occasion of the
   <strong>
    II International Congress of Writers in Defense of Culture held in Valencia Spain in 1937
   </strong>
   :
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    If culture is something inseparable from the general productivity of the peoples, if the same violent intervention can deprive the peoples of butter and sonnet, if in effect culture is something so material, what should be done then in favor of your defense?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    What can she do? Can you beat? Be hit, then you can. The fight has its different phases. The different cultural producers oppose only only impulsively to the terrible events in their country. But already the designation of barbarity as a barbarity means: beat. Then they join against barbarity, what is necessary to do to beat. They pass from the protest to the appeal, of the regret to the call of struggle. Not only do they indicate with the fingers towards criminal action, but they call criminals by name and demand their punishment. They realize that the condemnation of oppression has to end with the extermination of the oppressors, that the compassion with the victims of violence must become rejection against the aggressors, the compassion in rage and the aversion against violence in violence. To the violence of the privileged class, violence, full and destroying violence of the people must be opposed
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   That these words of the German playwright serve to call the artists of the town, who with difficulties travel schools, squares, villages, theaters ... through all corners of the country to make the decision to beat with their people in the struggle that is nearby To resurgence. To those who also suffer in flesh live social and economic violence, those who feel with enormous passion in their bowels the pain of the people, we call them to also consider the importance from their trade contributing to the preparation and organization of the popular assemblies .
  </p>
<p>
   That their texts, their actions and their dramatic and comic words continue talking about the memory of the people, of the tragedies that should not be forgotten and cannot continue to live, but also speak of the victories, to take lesson of the facts that They serve to continue beating against oppressors. That he speaks of his power and strength as producers of all the wealth, that he is able to talk about his defects, those unique defects of the proletariat against which he must fight to continue moving forward. That speaks of the most important task of unity and struggle independently to face all oppressors; How to truly exercise popular power directly in popular assemblies.
  </p>
<p>
   And, although they are a lot of authors who through history have put their art at the service of the revolution, we share with you a fragment of the work "The days of the commune", by Bertolt Brecht. In this particular scene we witness how the Parisian people were learning during the commune of 1781 to exercise direct democracy, to make the most revolutionary decisions that the people need. The scene ends with a beautiful song: "Or all or none", which summarizes the great discussion that was fought in this scene and that if we saw it live up the spirits upload to the revolutionary struggle; A song that perfectly complements the slogan that extended on the walls of the streets in Colombia since 28th of 2021:
   <em>
    Only the people save the people
   </em>

  The Datafolha Institute yesterday released a survey on the image of the Federal Supreme Court. Its result pointed to a technical draw among those who evaluate positively and negatively. In the historical series, the positive assessment never exceeded 31%, while the negative evaluation has already reached 38%.
 </p>
<p>
  In March 2024, 40% of respondents evaluate the STF's work as “regular”. And while there is a drop in the group that evaluates the Supreme Court is “bad” or “bad” (from 38% in December 2023 to 28% in the latest survey), only 29% of respondents judge as “great” or “good ”. The survey also confirmed that among Bolsonaro supporters there are more critics of the Supreme Court when compared to Luiz Inacio's.
 </p>
<p>
  The advance of investigations into the institutional rupture plan by former President Jair Bolsonaro and some military personnel, so was not enough to positively modify the perception of respondents regarding the role of the country's Supreme Court. The explanations for this necessarily go through the phenomenon of the crisis of legitimacy of all political institutions in the country. As an institution of the old basic state, the Supreme Court tends to distance itself more and more from the interests of the people. It is necessary to recognize that the large performance of the Supreme Court in order to investigate and punish those involved in the coup plots is not able to ensure democratic freedoms. And it is possible to prove how the population tends to evaluate the court from a quick look in its latest actions.

   decided that banks can take real estate
  </a>
  (even without judicial decision) in case of late payment of the financing. On November 29, 2023, a thesis proposed by Alexandre de Moraes was approved that the indemnity was allowed to be charged and the removal of content from press vehicles in the event of liar information publication. If in appearance the thesis goes by
  <em>
   “combate a fake news
  </em>
  ”The text leaves no doubt about how comprehensive and vague criteria - especially the use of an inaccurate criterion such as“ offenses ”,“ honor ”,“ moral ”, etc. -They are used to constitute another instrument that, joining the others, will be
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/sionistas-da-conib-pedem-prisao-do-jornalista-breno-altman-em-nova-tentativa-de-censura/">
   used against freedom of the press and expression
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court also expresses its vision and political interests through its inaction. When
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/organizacoes-denunciam-prisao-de-jovens-em-sp-sob-lei-dos-crimes-contra-o-estado-democratico-de-direito/">
   Nine young people were arrested during a demonstration and indicted for “criminal organization”, “corruption of minors” and “attempted abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law”
  </a>
  , there was not one minister to make a statement - even though
  <em>
   in off
  </em>
  - For no communication monopoly in the country.
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/stf-decide-que-bancos-podem-tomar-imoveis-de-devedores-sem-decisao-judicial/">
   murder a musician and a 257 -shot cans
  </a>
  stated that it was a “misunderstood error”, advocating the use of the infamous legal provision
  <em>
   unlawful
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In the actions and silences of the STF ministers is expressed the essence of their class position, therefore. They do not want to avoid a coup d'état or eliminate the conditions of institutional crisis that engenders the far right; Yes, they seek to better accommodate in the power structure in force through disputes with the far right and demarcations/negotiations with the military right. It is false that only Bolsonarist fanatics have reason to criticize the Supreme Court. It is a mistake to leave to the far right the priority in the criticism of this oligarchic and anti-povo institution.

  On the morning of March 20, 2023, a public hearing was held in the municipality of Barra do Corda convened by the Barra do Corda Rural Workers Union and the Family Farmers Association of Fazenda São Francisco to denounce the crimes of the latifundal The life of the peasants of the São Francisco Camp, located in the Carrasco village.
 </p>
<p>
  Peasant families suffer from the action of militias and gunmen at the behest of land grary landowners. The conflict in Barra do Corda gained national projection at the end of last year when a group of gunmen was ambushed
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/ma-emboscada-contra-grupo-pistoleiro-empenhado-em-despejo-ilegal-revela-presenca-massiva-de-policiais-no-bando/">
   during an attempted illegal eviction in the village Carrasco, which resulted in the death of a military police officer
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  As a form of retaliation, two peasants were murdered, Adonias Fernandes da Silva and Francisco Pereira da Silva Filho. In a support note to the São Francisco camping peasants published on March 13, 2024, the Solidarity Committee for the Fight for the Land (Comsolute) states: “All propaganda that the peasants were killed in confrontation is the attempted Secretariat of Public Security to mask the fact that there was a gang of active and retirees police that would massacreate the peasants to secure the land for the land grabbers. ”

  The peasants in struggle of the village vilela, from the municipality of Junco do Maranhão, even traveled Barra do Corda to be present at the hearing as a demonstration of solidarity and example that the consequent union and peasant organization is able to gain great victories. In addition to the participation of the vilela village, students of the Student Collective Children of the People were present and a member of the Com -Solute who have remembered at all times in their interventions that the peasants in Barra do Corda are not alone in their fight and that they will disclose what is occurring to break the attempted criminalization and isolation untied by the press in Maranhão.

<p>
  Since March 11, Salvador's technical-administrative servers in Education (TAES) have raised an indefinite strike demanding career restructuring, salary recomposition and budgetary recomposition of universities. It is estimated that currently servers of more than 30 universities have joined the strike movement.
 </p>
<p>
  With frozen salaries seven years ago, workers report the high career dropout rate that, according to the career plan of the technical and administrative positions in education (PCCTAE), in 2022, already exceeds the rate of 70%, indicative of which , given the devaluation and lack of career attractiveness, PCCTAE is seen as a "trampoline" for other careers in the federal executive, thus resulting in the precariousness of public service and the accumulation of functions.
 </p>
<p>
  Contradicting the speech of President Luíz Inácio (PT) about the strike movement that “in his government professionals could 'make a strike'”, workers from the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) denounced that Normative Instruction 54/2021 maintained Since the Bolsonaro government, it is being used by the UFPB rector to repress the category with the point cut.
 </p>
<p>
  During the national strike, Salvador's TAE's are fulfilling a mobilization agenda requiring rights. On March 11, the category held a protest in front of the UFBA Rectory, traveling to Piedade Square, and joining students to demand greater investments in education in the face of recent cuts and the restructuring of PCCTAE. On other days, they also held leaflets and meetings.
 </p>
<p>
  Already last Friday, March 22, the workers held a protest at UFBA Campus Ondina and occupied the Praça das Artes, distributing leaflets and making complaints to students about the devaluation of the category. The demonstration was held in conjunction with the university teachers who also paralyzed their activities requiring salary adjustment and budget recomposition. The teachers are in a “permanent state of mobilization”, thus pressing the negotiations about the salary lag of the category.
 </p>
<p>
  The category also reported that on the morning of the same day the blockade of R $ 2.9 million had been announced in the budget in discretionary spending. The recent budget cuts of the various areas are necessary for the government to meet the interests of imperialism and the local ruling classes to meet the new spending ceiling, the tax framework, and the zero fiscal deficit target.
 </p>
<p>
  The local correspondent
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  He was present at the protest on March 22, coverage and an interview with a technical-administrative server.
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
<strong>
   Check out the full interview below:
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   To nova democracy (and)
  </strong>
  : We find that one of the main guidelines of the act is the salary readjustment, how do you evaluate the appreciation of administrative technicians in the federal network?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Answer (R)
  </strong>
  : The question of readjustment is that according to our demand and considering the other careers of the federal executive we are the one who receives least. From fear here, there were more than 30% salary loss due to the increase in inflation. So we understand that this is the moment. In the previous government, we wanted to end up openly with universities, at least we believe that there is the possibility of dialogue. And for a long time, unions have been trying to sensitize central management about the importance of career, but they do not recognize many things that we do as servers, do not recognize that we do research and extension. It has that too. There is a lag regarding the other careers and also an ignorance of the reach of our work.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  : We also had access to information that the career dropout rate is around 70% and because of this there are reports around the accumulation of functions and consequent demotivation, could you talk a little more about it?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   R:
  </strong>
  There is such data that you have brought and also a peculiarity of the middle-level administrative career: many servers use this contest as a “mere contest” that is not the main objective. They move on to secure an income while parallel to this are focused on other better career contests, precisely because it is a career that is not attractive. It is the one that has the worst remuneration of the executive.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  In this sense, we find that the announcement of the new federal institutes, how do you evaluate this in the scenario of such devaluation of the profession?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   R:
  </strong>
  It is a point that we should follow. Because in theory it is good to have more if, but in return those that exist are in condition of structural precariousness. If you go to Camaçari, it is high bush, it is outdated structure. So that's it, everything is achievement, nothing is given. While it can be good, it can be a breakthrough. We should follow, as we can “build” the equipment and not maintain. So it's accompanying and fighting all the time.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   AND:
  </strong>
  It is also the agenda of the strike the budget recomposition of universities and federal institutes, we have already reported in our portal including a case about the crisis of university homes, could talk a little more about this topic? How does this affect working conditions for the category?
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   R:
  </strong>
  Everything is interconnected. They must have affirmative policies that enable the permanence of UFBA students. So, a broken budget, corresponding to the budget, if I'm not mistaken, from 2016, where there was an increase in costs since there, this makes the end of the university unfeasible.

   Graffiti against the Indian state's counter-revolutionary operation Samadhan-Paharly commenced in 2017 against India's Communist Party (Maoists) and People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA). As part of the operation, the Indian state also performed genocide policy against Adavasi-poor farmers in resource-rich parts of India. This counter-revolutionary operation grew to become the larger Surajkund offensive in 2022, after the Indian state chose to intensify its Chiang Kai-Shek-like surrounding operation against the guerrilla zone. Just like the former Operation Green Dog, Samdhan-Pahar and the Surajkund offensive will be beaten back by the Indian masses, their Flektopp India's Communist Party (Maoists) under Marxism-Leninism-Maoism's leadership.

  The espionage network that was structured by former President Jair Bolsonaro from the Israeli program “
  <em>
   First Mile
  </em>
  ”It was used to spy on Augusto Heleno. The Federal Police investigation has come to information that a mobile number used by Heleno for work issues was consulted eleven times, according to journalist Renata Agostini of the press monopoly O Globo.
 </p>
<p>
  The mobile number was not in the name of the former minister of the institutional security office, which indicates that it was someone very close to Augusto Heleno who used the information to spy it. There are suspicions that Jair Bolsonaro was suspicious of nearby allies, including Heleno.
 </p>
<p>
  Reserve general and decades with military coup, Augusto Heleno was responsible for an attempt to appease a major crisis from Jair Bolsonaro's government. That was when former Minister Sérgio Moro delivered office accusing Bolsonaro of interference with the PF. Heleno then met with Moro to discourage him to leave the government, to no avail. Jair Bolsonaro complained about the scarcity of strategic information, which also falls on the former GSI minister, responsible for intelligence.
 </p>
<p>
  With each new revelation of the “parallel abin” it is found that the structure was operated by the far right indiscriminately. In the transition from Jair Bolsonaro's government to Luiz Inacio, the GSI moved to the hands of a “trusted man” of the current president, who contradictorily maintaining Bolsonarists at major ABIN posts. It is necessary to clarify whether the Israeli application spy is still used by Bolsonarists kept at Abin. To date, the total list of the numbers spied on the “parallel” were not available, although there are suspicions that more than 10,000 numbers were targeted. The General Court of the Union (CGU) should open, in the coming days, disciplinary administrative proceedings against the servers involved in the scheme.
 </p>
<p>
  What is known is that the use of the program “
  <em>
   First Mile
  </em>
  ”It should be restricted to a single individual, appointed by Abin (whose control is within GSI's own attributions). In fact, the program was operated by numerous allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. It was through the remote access of other devices that these pockets constantly accessed the program and delivered dossiers to Carlos Bolsonaro. This has all ever bothered either Augustus Heleno, nor to the military commanders (ultimately responsible for the spy and intelligence apparatus in the country).
 </p>
<p>
  However, if neither Augusto Heleno nor the military has bothered, the Luiz Inacio government has reasons to bother and investigate the issue.
 </p>
<p>
  Appointed by the president, the current director general of ABIN, Luiz Fernando Corrêa, keeps in positions Chaves

   known pockets
  </a>
  . He has already met Alexandre Ramagem, who is regarded as one of those responsible for the “parallel Abin” and was recently the target of a PF operation that found $ 172,000 in kind. An ABIN computer was found in this same operation, which also had targets Carlos Bolsonaro (pointed out as the political coordinator of ABIN parallel). The following questions must be clearly answered: the computer found in

  Did you have access to sensitive information? The Israeli application “
  <em>
   First Mile
  </em>
  Is it still used by Abin? What do the pockets do who still remain in the structure of federal government intelligence? It will be no use that CGU resorts half a dozen bureaucratic measures to remove from the position of a few involved in the tramonia if the fundamental issues are not resolved. It is in the hands of Luiz Inacio to find answers to this.

<p>
  On the morning of March 26, application drivers across the country made a national mobilization in protest against Luiz Inácio's Bill (PL), which intends to regulate the profession of application driver. Workers denounced the low value of work hours provided for in the PL (R $ 32.10 per hour worked) and the non -establishment of the employment relationship between workers and companies.
 </p>
<p>
  There were major demonstrations in the capitals Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brasilia (DF), Fortaleza (CE), Recife (PE), and Campo Grande (MS), among many other cities across the country.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  The government response
 </h3>
<p>
  In several protests, drivers denounced the government's attitude towards the claims of the category. In Recife, the president of the Pernambuco Drivers and Motor Motor Association, Thiago Silva, said in his speech:
 </p>
<p>
  “The union does not represent us. It is not fair that you spend almost a year discussing and presenting a project as bad as this, which ends up hurting a whole chain of workers of more than 1.5 million people, by people who supposedly should represent us and simply joined with The government with the platforms to take pictures hand in hand, all in Brasilia. ”
 </p>
<p>
  According to the press monopoly O Globo, while the demonstrations took place, Luiz Inacio had made a series of telephone calls to his ministers demanding that there was a "better communication" about the project to drivers.
 </p>
<p>
  However, Luiz Inacio also made it clear that the project focuses on maintaining the “autonomy” of the category. Affirmation that goes against the real interest of drivers who today denounce the lack of labor bonds between workers and companies.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  What is the PL?
 </h3>
<p>
  The PL aims to create the category of “autonomous worker per platform”, which persists not to establish an employment relationship between the driver and the owner of the application. Therefore, the serious informality problem does not change.
 </p>
<p>
  As for the minimum compensation per hour worked stipulated by the PL (R $ 31.10), drivers report that this is already the daily average of gains among workers. Very low value when considering that it is drivers who bear the costs of their own work.
 </p>
<p>
  Data from
  <em>
   StopClub
  </em>
  They point out that the average cost that the application driver bears hours worked (fuels, maintenance, food, among others), corresponds to the amount of R $ 26.88. Therefore, the minimum amount of R $ 31.10 for hours worked would generate a real gain of only R $ 5.32 per hour worked.
 </p>
<p>
  Taking into account the maximum workload provided for in the CLT, 220 hours a month, the “salary floor” of the application driver would correspond to R $ 1,145.47, 19% lower than the current minimum wage.
 </p>
<p>
  The government's proposal, therefore, is far from meeting the interests of drivers: it does not provide for a fair compensation, does not establish employment between the worker and the company, and therefore institutionalizes the poor working conditions that affect the category.

<p>
  It is strange to hear from the Minister of Justice of the Government of Shift, Ricardo Lewandowsky, that the Marielle case is closed without a plausible motivation. That the Brazão family and former Civil Police chief, Rivaldo Barbosa, are involved, no one doubts. But it is stupid to think that Marielle was executed in downtown Rio de Janeiro in 2018, amid military intervention, for voting against a bill that was approved for the benefit of the cariocas mafias (poorly called “militias”). The execution, done in a spatious way to the fashion of the far right, sending a clear message to the left and with the objective of destabilizing the political situation, has no identity with the motivation presented for crime as the conclusion of the PF survey.
 </p>
<p>
  Bolsonaro clan with Élcio de Queiroz and Ronnie Lessa, driver and executor of shots on March 14, 2018, are known. On Marielle's execution day, Élcio de Queiroz was in the Bolsonaro condominium and is in the book of visits his name and apartment 58, whose owner is Jair Bolsonaro. Why did the minister of Luiz Inácio ignore this fact, reported in 2019 by the condominium doorman? Ronnie Lessa received from Bolsonaro a prosthesis when she lost her leg in an attack in 2009. Why does Lessa say she doesn't know Bolsonaro?
 </p>
<p>
  Adriano da Nobrega, another involved in the case, was killed in 2020 when he began to be investigated for involvement in the Marielle Franco case. There are many telephone conversations, intercepted by the investigators, in which Adriano mentions "Jair" and "president", and even says that "fucks herself for being friends with the president." What is the relationship of Adriano and Bolsonaro? He was killed when the investigation started to have it as a target, and Adriano's wife says it was “file burning” in a coordinated police operation between PM Carioca and Bahia. Who Adriano could incriminate that at that time had power to coordinate a national police operation to execute it? Finally, the former Civil Police chief was appointed one day before Marielle's execution during the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro, by order of intervener Braga Netto, even though he received warnings that Rivaldo was not reliable. Why did the investigation out of this fact?
 </p>
<p>
  Perhaps the receipt, Bolsonaro took refuge for two days at the Embassy of Hungary, a country ruled by one of the world's far-right heads and a friend of Capetão, when Marielle's investigations rapidly passed on to prisons. Bolsonaro is afraid of? Although it is true, besides this reason there is no shortage of others: there is accusations, inquiries and processes of various crimes committed by him who could lead him to prison.
 </p>
<p>
  Admittedly, the Bolsonaro clan has some kind of relationship, to some degree, with the murder of Marielle Franco. She was not killed for voting against a bill, nor the Brazão would be stupid to the point of attracting to themselves all the attention of their criminal businesses, with a spailed political murder,
  <em>
   just because
  </em>
  They were confronted in a vote, where even the vote of the councilwoman had been decisive. The motivation presented by the PF resembles a fake track that pointed to certain "militias", as did the Civil Police in 2018, when he had accused another militia who was already reclusive and fulfilling a 25 -year conviction - Orlando Oliveira Araújo “Curicica” - as principal of the attack against Marielle; At the time, Orlando rejected the accusation, for which there was no proof to present.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   The investigations, unlike the unfortunate speech of Luiz Inacio's minister, are not completed - at least, not from the scientific point of view and the truth. There is much to deepen if you want to prove the real motivation of the crime. But judging by the conduct of the minister and Luiz Inácio, irreducibly committed to the policy of appeasement with the militics, the purpose of these is even to bury the subject.
  </p>
<p>
   Who had Marielle Franco killing ???

<p>
  An unprecedented survey by cartography of the attacks against indigenous people (CACI), an organ of the Missionary Indigenous Council (CIMI) managed to map, even facing informative difficulties, the origin of native peoples imprisoned in Minas Gerais in the Krenak Reformat and Guarani Farm, concentration camps and Centers of torture created by the military dictatorship, a fascist regime established on April 1, 1964.
 </p>
<p>
  The dossier called
  <em>
   The Concentration Field of Indians of Minas Gerais
  </em>
  It was released a long time ago and showed that the victimized Indians belonged to 23 different tribes from the entire country, located in 11 states of 5 regions. They were: karajá, terena, maxacali, pataxó, kadiwéu, xerant, kaiowá, bororo, krahô, guarani, pankarau, guajajara, cinnamon, fulni-ô, kaingang, vulture, campaign, xacriabá, tupiniquim, sateré-mawé, ashaninka, ashaninka , Javaé (adding the Krenak themselves, perhaps the most affected).
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   But such data may be short of the reality of repression, as it has recently been known through researcher Marcelo Zelic that it is estimated that only 20% of the arrests were found in those prisons. .
  </em>
</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  “Very serious denunciations”
 </h3>
<p>
  “The systematization of historical records, in addition to research on new documents and testimonials, allowed the organization for the first time of a map (accessible on the Internet) that indicates the origin of the indigenous people detained in the Krenak Reformat and, after 1972, on Guarani Farm, both in mg. Krenak functioned as a concentration camp and a torture center, according to a chapter of the National Truth Commission report (CNV). ”
 </p>
<p>
  “Among the documents gathered, there are very serious complaints involving both centers and also Indigenous Rural Guard (GRIN), as well as reports that include the names of those responsible for such violations.”
 </p>
<p>
  Manoel Pinheiro, Captain of PM Minas Gerais was one of the cited, along with 6 other police officers. The most revolting is that Indians were also forced to become torturers. Were the recruited for Grin, who was trained in torture techniques, according to the film
  <em>
   "Smiling"
  </em>
  , from Jesco von Puttkamer.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  General Bandeira: Evils and Gold
 </h3>
<p>
  Another name associated with the torturers was General Oscar Geronymo Bandeira de Melo. Reformat Cryer and Funai President from 1970 to 1974, is responsible for keeping Krenak “as a prison and place of torture, death and forced disappearance of indigenous people ”.
 </p>
<p>
  The general also headed Funai's security and information, subordinate to the “famous” National Information Service (SNI). Then he was ahead of the Bradin group Itapiranga mining company, where he received permission to research gold in the land of the Urubu-Kaapor Indians.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  The dead and the rebels
 </h3>

  The military tried to hide the data, but Gaucho Unisinos University found that about 8,000 indigenous people were killed during the dictatorship, only in the construction of highways. They were mainly victims of the “rush”, killing expeditions to “clean and prepare” the terrain for the works, through fires and bombing.
 </p>
<p>
  Already the agricultural reformatory Krenak, which was in the municipality of Resplendor (MG), began operating in 1969, imprisoning indigenous people considered as rebels. In 1972 it was closed and the detainees transferred to the Guarani Farm in Carmesia (MG).
 </p>
<p>
  In both prisoners were subject to practices such as physical punishment, forced work and torture (Arara stick, drowning, whipping, etc.).
 </p>
<p>
  The prohibition of speaking your own language was also a rule, and physical punishment was appropriate.
 </p>
<p>
  In case of escapes, cash rewards were offered to people in nearby cities.
 </p>
<p>
  If they were caught were punished and in some cases dead. As an example, Dedé is quoted, Pataxó huh-hm-hãe, sent to presidency for acting in land conflict. Dedé did not accept his confinement, fled, and in the persecution would have been drowned by a guard.

  An event with the Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann there was recently held in Baden Württemberg. This event was particularly noticeable due to the enormously high police presence, which could be seen all around. Now about a month later, the sum that this police operation cost has become public.
 </p>
<p>
  We are talking about the
  <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/regional/badenwuerttemberg/swr-polizeischutz-330-000-euro-kostete-kretschmanns-fastenpredigt-nahe-biberach-100.html">
   Fasting sermon at Biberach
  </a>
  . Actually a typical 0815 event, where a high politician can be seen on any social occasion, chatted around a bit and pulls out a small self -portrayal show for his voters. Now those who looked at this appearance were somewhat shocked at the beginning. So, as is typical on such occasions, a certain amount of police plus the politician's personal protectionists were present. No, rather, the corresponding place was military occupied by a large contingent of the police. In addition to the barrier grilles set up on all sides, 600 police officers, eight police horses, 135 police vehicles, three prisoners, and a helicopter, were at the scene and monitored the appearance of Kretschmann.
 </p>
<p>
  A martial police force for such an event, which of course also costs money. Some people will also have wondered how expensive this large -scale operation was concrete. Now this question has been answered. As the Federal Ministry of the Interior now announced when asked by the AfD, the costs for the use were 330,000 euros
 </p>
<p>
  This large -scale operation was justified with the

<p>
    While such enormous sums are spent on securing party events, poverty in this country continues to increase. An example of this is the question of homelessness. So there is one from 2022
    <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/wohnungslose-deutschland-statistik-100.html">
     Investigation of the Federal Working Group on Homeless Aid
    </a>
    that determines that the number of homeless people rose by over 58% compared to the previous year alone. About a week ago there was also a
    <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/europarat-armut-deutschland-100.html">
     Report of the Council of Europe
    </a>
    Published, which determines that poverty continues to increase in Germany and that the federal government is not doing too little to do it.
   </p>
<p>
    As we see, there are more than enough options for how to use the money that is so generously thrown out of the window for the high men and women's police protection for the police protection of the high men and women. However, this is obviously not done. It is precisely this withdrawal of politicians and ignorance, compared to the problems of the people, is the reason why they do them right to fear more and more from us.

  Jair Bolsonaro's defense responded on the afternoon of March 27 to the request of the Supreme Court Minister, Alexandre de Moraes, who had asked the former president to clarify about the motivations of the stay at the Hungary embassy between March 13 and 14 . The defense has classified as “illogical” the idea that the former president visited Hungary's embassy to ask for political asylum, highlighting Bolsonaro's political relations with “foreign leaders aligned with the conservative profile” from around the world.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the former president's lawyer, he did not try to escape the country, even though he was the target of a precautionary measure of the PF that retained his passport. Stating that the attempted escape thesis is “highly unlikely and unfounded,” in the end, the defense corroborates Jair Bolsonaro's political strategy of creating a political fact in the national political situation.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  Here's what Jair Bolsonaro's defense said:
 </h3>
<p>
  Fabio Wajngarten, Bolsonaro's lawyer, said in a statement that his client has a "national and international political commitment agenda." So, even without mandate, Bolsonaro “remains extremely active,” highlighting Bolsonaro's political relations. The defense even informing matters dealt with with Hungary diplomatic representatives: "They dealt with strategic matters of international policy of interest to the conservative sector." The trips to Argentina were also listed to visit Javier Milei, and the invitation received from Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  Bolsonaro's defense insists on the same Bolsonaro thesis
 </h3>
<p>
  Yesterday, former cowardly president had already gone similar message: “I maintain a circle of friendship with some heads of state around the world. They are concerned. I talk to them subjects of interest to our country. And point. The rest is speculation, ”said Bolsonaro.
 </p>
<p>
  Jair Bolsonaro intends to act in order to avoid being arrested and it is possible that he has received alerts from his own party, the PL, where there is a huge fear of the STF has set a "schedule" for the arrest of Jair Bolsonaro before its municipal elections year.
 </p>
<p>
  Embassies are considered foreign territories, being inviolable to the authorities of the country of origin. In the case of an arrest request, Bolsonaro could not be arrested there. But it couldn't leave the embassy either. An impasse would be created, therefore. This impasse would be a political fact: the next act of the arrest decree would be the far-right coup agitation around the “legal persecution against Bolsonaro”-a thesis that has been used, in fact, for a long time. December 2022, and the attempt to escape during the carnival, Bolsonaro continues to pursue the same three goals as usual: to disentangle the image of
  <em>
   cowardity
  </em>
  , accuse the STF of persecution and incite a military coup. Such a far-right tactical offensive, even if the conditions are not the best, cannot be discarded. The only certainty follows that the full and complete punishment of scammers can only be the work of the popular forces.

   As it can be seen, this is not the first time that the morenist government of Martínez Neri hits our comrades, be it in the commerce sector, the trash recollection sector or the people’s colonies. The same happens with other democratic organizations and residents of the city affected by the fact that the municipal government is integrated by several characters that started in the people’s movements and now they are transformed in millionaire and repressive people. Day after day, the residents of Oaxaca understand more that the municipal government is an opportunist government, that everyday is more far from the people. The image of the one who was a publisher in UABJO during the social conflict on 2006 fells by its own weight, letting to be seen his new entrepreneur and enemy of the people’s movement face. No one should doubt on that,
   <strong>
    there will be an organized answer by the people! Stop the harassment and repression against our comrades! Down with the electoral bourgeois farce! Neri,
   </strong>
<strong>
    represser

<strong>
    ! Not a single vote to Neri!

  their concerns for the development as the Lok Sabha (House of the People, lower house of the Indian parliament) elections are coming up, and they fear the election boycott campaign of the Maoists could gain hold in new areas. In the media it has also been highlighted that this area could provide strategically valuable routes to the neighboring regions for the guerrillas. A repressive operation of paramilitaries and police has been launched in the area.

   At first, 
  I never expected to imprison for so much. Before my conviction, 
 Within a period of three years, I was in prison for 17 months. After 
 The conviction, I stayed in prison for 7 years. Total, nearly 8.5

   First
 I suffered from brachial plexus paralysis. There was a rupture of the nervous 
system that connects the shoulder to the brain because of the 
ill-treatment by the police when they kidnapped and arrested me. This
 It hurt my shoulder. I can't lift my left hand. I can't
 to do nothing with it. I can't keep a book.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Because of
 of destruction of the nervous system, muscles were also affected 
of the shoulder. Because of pulling and trauma, my left ribs
 They were crowded and crushed. These hit the lungs. With the 
Their turn, these affected my heart, and hit the left side 
her. But my backbone was also affected, because the ribs 
They were crushed in a small spot.

<p align="JUSTIFY">

   All
 This side of my body has been affected. In the last 10 years, 
I feel severe pain in my left arm and leg. Because of its destruction 
nervous system and muscles, my left shoulder is paralyzed 
completely.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Because of 
  The effect on my left lung, sleep apnea began. From the 
 Nose to the lungs, the path of breathing was affected. This 
 caused a obstructive sleep apnea. Because of this, I can't 
 sleep.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   I have 
  suffer a state of the heart called hypertrophic 
 Cardiomyopathy, which had not been detected in any medicine 
 exam before I throw in prison. As a result of this, the left side 
 The heart works only with 55% of its ability. Began and 
 high blood pressure because the heart wall could not 
 push the blood quite a bit into my body.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   That's all 
  In ten years, I developed a bladder in the brain. It is not much

   Found
 Also, kidney stones due to limited life and difficulties 
movement without the possibility of exercise or any physical 
activity in prison. Although the stones were crushed, cysts 
formed in the right kidney.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   I still developed bile stones due to a lack of feeding for long periods. This led to pancreatitis.

<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   THE 
  list is endless. All of these diseases were developed in prison. 
 Until I went out there was no proper medical care these ten 
 years. Therefore, I suffer from multiple diseases.

   He needs 
  Now to have this medical care. It all depends on how now,

  will remain affected and will be able to be carried out. This will 
 See.

   The 
  Next days, I will be in hospitals for exams and treatments. 
 We do not know how much it will get and to what extent I will recover.

 had been written in the decision to reject the suspension that I should have 
 Regular and appropriate medical care.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Nevertheless, 
  Prison authorities ignored and violated the decision. Although with 
 They sent to Nagpour Medical School several times, it was about 
 Something typical and rough. I was just going and returning. With this, 
 They showed that they were trying to provide me with treatment, but there was no 
 treatment.

</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   If 
  See my medical history, you will see how medical care 
 It was avoided and not provided. In the end, just before I release, every 
 section wrote that [this treatment or medicine] are not available, not 
 We can do this, it's available elsewhere. Why doctors wrote 
 Only at the end of the ten years that they couldn't heal me? I will 
 They had to report it ten years ago.

   THE 
  Class course expresses its solidarity in the struggle given by 
 LARCO employees and their families for the right to 
 work and life.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  It is a fight they have been waging for years against
  <b>
   LARCO's deliberate depreciation and sale process,
  </b>
  both by the ND government and from the previous ones (SYRIZA, 
 PASOK etc.). This approach is that has led LARCO to be 
 For two years off, in a 'special management' regime 
 and her workers waiting with constant extensions.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   Now, 
  850 workers are in danger of being on the road as on March 31 
  expire their contracts and no one is committed to what will 
 they get off.
  </b>
<br/>
  This development will have tragic consequences not only for 
  workers and their families, but also for all the surrounding 
 area. How will they live? Where will they stay? How will they pay the loans? How 
 Will their children study?
 </p>
<p>
  These questions are asked by the reality and with mass struggle they must be answered.
  <b>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Struggle to maintain all jobs and all labor rights.
  </b>
<b>
<br/>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Against
  </b>
  In
 Hostage of workers, defeatism, terrorism and 
blackmail to accept the deterioration of working conditions for his own sake 
any "investor-savior".
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Against
  </b>
  In hunger programs 
  of DBA (formerly OAED) which is raw mockery for workers and 
 They aim to disorient them and eventually get rid of them.
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Against
  </b>
  to 
  Anti-labor-Antilaular Policy that behind the talk about 
 'Development' hides the black reality of poverty, unemployment 
 and desolation. Is the same policy that left their fate 
 Thousands of fields in Thessaly after the devastating floods.
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Mass
 and unyielding struggle for the right to full and stable work,
 with decent wages and working conditions, and all safety measures.
  </b>
<br/>
  THE 
  LARCO employees' power is in the massage and 
 Scaling their fight! The support and solidarity by the people and the 
 The world of work is important and must be given!
  <br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   THE 
 Righteous struggle of LARCO workers is a race of all 
 working class and as such should be supported by the whole 
 workers.

  The cancellation of fines by the municipality was the result of the mobilizations in which our organization, the complaints, the protests at the Athens City Council, the decisive policy of refusing to pay them and the claim to cancel all fines, all the fines immediately, for post -adhesion imposed. Both in herself and other forces (KKE, days25).
  <br>
<br>
  The struggle must continue, with the aim of canceling the fines imposed by the Attica Region, as well as to defend free political action, trafficking of ideas, posters, banner suspension, demonstration and strike. Right rights, which are also targeted by the system attack, with various pretexts.

  The Army of Israel bombed the headquarters of the
  <i>
   General Federation of Palestinian unions (Pgftu)
  </i>
  in the city of Gaza. The headquarters of the
  <i>
   Pgftu
  </i>
  provided 
  crucial services [to the whole population], including a kindergarten for 380 
  children and a bakery that served many families. It is the third time 
 that the general headquarters of the
  <i>
   Pgftu
  </i>
  It undergoes such a destruction, the previous attacks had occurred during the Israeli bombing of Gaza in 2014.
 </p>
<p>
  Beyond the main building, three locations were destroyed
  <i>
   Pgftu
  </i>
  In the 
  Al-Riosal and Via Yarmouk district. The attack hit, beyond the 
  buildings, the means of subsistence and the rights of Palestinian workers. 
  However, Palestinian workers remain still on their positions: 
 We will persevere in our struggle for justice and dignity.
 </p>
<p>
  While we prepare to celebrate the
  <a href="https://www.palquest.org/en/highlight/14509/land-day-1976" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
<i>
    Palestinian earth day
   </i>
   March 30th
  </a>
  and the anniversary of the

<i>
    Great return march
   </i>
   of 2018
  </a>
  , 
  We continue to forcefully ask the unions and workers of everything 
 The world to stay by our side. We ask all the people of 
 awareness of ending the complicity with the crimes of Israel, a 
 begin with the immediate cessation of the weapon trade.

   Both the
   <i>

   </i>

   <i>
    Great return march
   </i>
   they have 
  a profound meaning for our people, because they remember the 
 our long struggle for the justice and the realization of ours 
 inalienable rights. In the face of the Israeli genocide and attempts 
 of ethnic cleaning in Gaza, it is essential to reaffirm the centrality of the 
  right to return for all Palestinians. Most of the 
 Palestinians, including those of Gaza, are refugees, and their right 
 Upon returning to its original houses, it remains at the center of the struggle 
 Palestinian.

<p>
  While we prepare for these commemorations, we are faced with the 
 Streeting situation of Gaza. The uninterrupted bombings and the 
 intentional hungry tactics of Israel reveal nature 
 genocida of his aggression, and unload on workers the 
 heavier consequences. The forced evacuation of the Palestinians 
 from the northern area of Gaza, together with the indiscriminate attacks 
 Against displaced people and vital infrastructures, they are a clear attempt 
  ethnic cleaning, a continuation of the
  <i>
   Nakba
  </i>
  of 1948.

   Workers 
  In Palestine it is a coordination of 30 workers unions e 
 Palestinian professional associations who have launched an appeal 
 unitary to put an end to any complicity with the state of "Israel" and a 
 stop by "Israel".
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We take note of the declarations and actions of the trade union movement in response
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/F8rvPYfscBbK1Vws/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   to the initial appeal of the Palestinian unions in October
  </a>
  And 
  We pay homage to all those who have lined up alongside the 
 Palestinian people. These acts of solidarity, both with the words and 
 with the actions, they are in continuity with the great tradition 
 of union internationalism. However, it is necessary to do more: 
 during the
  <i>
   Earth Day
  </i>
  We ask for an intensification of actions to end the genocide. It is essential to undermine
  <b>
   Not only the sale and financing of weapons in Israel
  </b>
  , but also
  <b>
   the
  </b>
<b>
   transport of these weapons and other key materials used by the Israeli army
  </b>
  To impose his brutal and illegal siege.
 </p>
<p>
  We ask workers and unions of the whole world to mobilize for the
  <i>
   Earth Day
  </i>
<i>
   2024
  </i>
  through:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
    The refusal of participation in the production and transport of weapons
   </b>
   destined 
  a/or from Israel; interrupting the logistics of the operations 
  military of Israel, we can prevent his ability to exercise 
 Further violence against our people.
  </li>
<li>
<b>
    The clash with the complicity of the governments that perpetuate Israel's aggression
   </b>
   . 
  This includes the dispute of the release of licenses for the sale of 
 weapons, and protests at defense and foreign ministries. THE 
 governments must be held responsible for their role in 
 facilitate the genocide of Israel.
  </li>
<li>
<b>
    The intensification of all effective trade union actions
   </b>
   – Passing motions, agitating in workplaces, organizing education sessions and networking.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Despite the horror of the genocide perpetrated by Israel and his 
 daily crimes against the Palestinians, we cannot sell to 
 Despair nor deviate our attention [from this]. In reverse, 
 To celebrate this historic day for the Palestinian people in the 
 our liberation struggle, we must renew our commitment to 
 remain united as workers against injustice.

  PALESTINIAN WORKERS’ CALL ON LAND DAY: FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOM. FIGHTING FOR OUR LAND.
 </h2>
<p>
  March 20, 2024
 </p>
<p>
  On March 7th, the Israeli military bombed the Palestinian General 
Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU) headquarters in Gaza City. The PGFTU 
headquarters housed crucial services, including a kindergarten for 380 
children and a bakery serving many families. This was the third time 
these headquarters faced such destruction, with previous attacks during 
Israel’s 2014 bombardment of Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to the main building, three PGFTU branches in the 
Al-Rimal neighbourhood and Yarmouk Street were also destroyed. This 
assault targeted more than just buildings—it struck at the very 
livelihoods and rights of Palestinian workers. Yet, Palestinian workers 
remain unwavering, we will persevere in our fight for justice and 
dignity.
 </p>
<p>
  As we prepare to mark Palestinian Land Day onMarch 30, and the 
anniversary of the 2018 Great March of Return, we continue to urge trade
 unions and workers worldwide to stand with us. We ask all people of 
conscience to end complicity with Israel’s crimes, starting with an 
immediate halt to the arms trade.
 </p>
<p>
  Land Day and the Great March of Return commemorations both hold 
profound significance for our people, serving as reminders of our 
enduring struggle for justice and the realisation of our inalienable 
rights. In the face of Israel’s genocide and attempts to ethnically 
cleanse Gaza, it is imperative to reaffirm the centrality of the right 
of return for allPalestinians. The majority of Palestinians, including 
those in Gaza, are refugees whose right to return to their original 
homes remains the core of the Palestinian struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  As we prepare to observe these commemorations, we are confronted with
 the harrowing situation in Gaza. Israel’s ceaseless bombardment and 
deliberate tactics of starvation expose the genocidal nature of its 
aggression, but also inflict the harshest consequences on workers. The 
forced evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza’s northern region, alongside
 indiscriminate attacks on evacuees and vital infrastructure are a clear
 attempt at ethnic cleansing, a continuation of the Nakba of 1948.
 </p>
<p>
  We note the statements and actions from the global trade union 
movement in response to the initial Palestinian trade unions call 
inOctober, and we salute all those who have stood with the people of 
Palestine. These gestures of solidarity, in both words and actions, are a
 continuation of the great tradition of trade union internationalism. 
However, more must be done: on Land Day we urge an escalation in actions
 to end the genocide. It is imperative that we target
  <strong>
   not only the sale and funding of arms to Israel
  </strong>
  , but also the
  <strong>
   transportation of these weapons and other key materials used by the Israeli military
  </strong>
  in enforcing its brutal and illegal siege.
 </p>
<p>
  We call on workers and trade unions worldwide to mobilise for Land Day 2024 by:
 </p>
<p>
  ●      Refusing to participate in the production and transportation 
of arms destined to or from Israel. By disrupting the logistics of 
Israel’s military operations, we can impede its ability to carry out 
further violence against our people.
 </p>
<p>
  ●      Confronting government complicity in perpetuating Israel’s 
aggression. This includes challenging the issuance of licenses for arms 
sales, protesting at defence and foreign ministries. Governments must be
 held accountable for their role in facilitating Israel’s genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  ●      Escalating all effective trade union actions – passing 
motions, taking action in your workplace, organising education sessions,
 and building networks.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the horror of Israel’s genocide and its daily crimes against 
Palestinians, we cannot despair or divert our attention. Instead, to 
mark this historic day for the people of Palestine in our struggle for 
liberation, let us renew our commitment to stand united as workers 
against injustice.
 </p>

<div>
  The Resistance Roads in Lassithi invite workers, youth, pensioners, to a mass rally/blockade of the national road in Selinari on Thursday 28/3 at 12:00.
 </div>
<div>
  To defend our right to full and free care,
 </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
  The hospital of Ag. Nicholas, Ierapetra and Sitia, they are threatened with closure !!! Because in order not to be fooled, their constant degradation, doctors' shortages, surgery suspensions, Lipsi on -calls lead to closure. Will we allow it ???
  <span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
</div>
<div>
  All of us, for years now, have been experiencing an unprecedented attack on our rights and conquests. The new ND government has not closed eight months and has voted for a series of anti -populist, anti -labor, anti -political laws in the service of the capital. The anti -labor law Georgiadis, which further intensifies the Middle Ages, the new tax bill that puts a padlock on thousands of self -employed, the law on the establishment of private universities. At the same time, fascist politics, state terrorism and repression, is intensifying, any resistance of youth and workers are criminalized.
 </div>
<div>
  No popular rights are no longer recognized by its capital and governments that abolish, what the working class and the people have conquered through many years of bloody struggles.
 </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
  This policy is also reflected in the issue of health.  The people's right to free health care is directly attacked.
 </div>
<div div="">
<div>
   This policy is experienced by the citizens of Lasithi, Crete, throughout the country. The resignations of non -replaced doctors, the shortages of medical and nursing staff resulting in postponements in hospital surgery and operations lead to depreciation and degradation and substantially closure. The whole situation concerns not only the hospitals of the Prefecture (Aga Nikolaou, Ierapetra, Sitia, Neapolis) and Rethymnon, and even Venizelio !!!, forming a black landscape in the right to care for the citizens of the area.
  </div>
<div>
   The way out in our struggles for our right to health care

<p>
  The KKE (M-L) is organizing an event on the occasion of 72 years since the execution of Nikos Belogiannis on Saturday 30 March at 19:00
 </p>
<p>
  Belogiannis' intense revolutionary action is intertwined with the history of the communist movement. In the difficult conditions of wars and open terrorism, he managed and left strong legacies for the advance of the case he persistently served. His contribution to the organizational and political upgrading of the KKE is unquestionable. He helped further the evolution of the KKE revolutionary conquests by writing his study of "foreign capital in Greece", a text that still remains today as content and form.
 </p>
<p>
  From his involvement in the rural mobilizations in Amaliada's birthplace, his action in Patras, in the first and second guerrillas to the trials of the "wireless", Belogiannis represented the integrity of the thousands of communists who gave their lives for freedom and independence.
 </p>
<p>
  The event will take place at the Stone "Instrust" where there will be a documentary exhibition of his career and scenes will be screened by Nikos Jima's film "The Man with the Carnation".

   At the beginning of February, the Albacete City Council warned many of us that they were going to expel us from our homes, specifically the neighbors of the streets of Chinchilla and Jorge Juan. The notice was made suddenly and without indicating a date and time for the launch, as it should indicate as legally. Now, a week in advance, they warn with a street poster (without individual notification) that on April 2 begins the demolition of our buildings.

   The 600 is a neighborhood born of poverty, everyone in Albacete is aware of the bad reputation of this area. It is a neighborhood turned into Guetto for the poorest of society forcedly because of the bad policies of the different governments of the City Council, Diputación and Autonomous Community. They all have direct and indirect responsibility.

   Just as it was born out of poverty, it is poverty that sustains its existence and has allowed that, despite the appalling sanitation conditions and the state of several of its buildings, the residents continue to live here. We ask the residents of the rest of Albacete not to be deceived by a bad image that does not correspond to reality. The houses in the neighbourhood are a lifeline for many families who cannot afford to rent and for hard-working immigrants who would otherwise be living on the streets. Many of us have been working here all our lives, or we have put our physical integrity at risk to come to Spain by the world's deadliest routes from Africa.

<em>
   This is a reality that is not expressed too much, while it lies blatantly over the neighborhood: that 600 is a neighborhood of thugs, drug traffickers and criminals, that the neighbors there “we have no solution”, etc. They convert the neighborhood into Guetto forcedly for the poorest, and above, then criminalize the situation blaming ... to whom we live in the neighborhood! Drug trafficking does not come from nothing. It is a painful consequence that is born of poverty sustained by the policies of the City Council, Diputación and Autonomous Community.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b00b4826e4f048bbf29bb42e4ac176ac">
<em>
   Another reality that Albacete are also aware is that a solution has been promised for years to the 600 problem, and we are suffering that attempted solution now. It turns out that the plan consisted of throwing us all into the street without any consideration. The plan, simply, is an urban remodeling to, in perspective, gentrify and expel its current neighbors through illegal evictions and systematic violation of human rights.

   A sign placed by the City Council expressed the following, in bold and underlined as transcribed here:

   We believe that this positioning is really intolerable, and does not seek to protect us as it says but to sow terror among the neighbors so that they voluntarily leave their homes (of course, without really having a place where to go) under the threat of suffering "personal damage." There is no housing alternative that is worth. The City Council says: Go and die of cold on the street, or stay and die buried. Many here we have already gone through maximum risks just by having a house to sleep. It is evident that this notice will not be able to evict or to a single person. Many neighbors of other blocks, mostly with family, see with concern how the situation develops, thinking that the following will be.

  The reaction of this government in the face of the legitimate expression of 
 dissent by students and university students in 
 against a state that is currently perpetrating a genocide 
 In Palestine, he demonstrates his more unequivocal way 
 fascist nature, well beyond rhetoric, which aims to repress 
 any type of dissent that threatens its economic interests e 
 geopolitics.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  The student disputes of these weeks 
 In fact, they are narrated as "antechamber of terrorism in Italy", 
 until the at least imaginative "infiltrations of the 
 Red brigades inside universities ". This goes to 
 legitimize the militarized repression implemented against 
 protests within universities, places of knowledge that 
 abdicate their critical role towards what is 
 happening, and protecting students and students. From Naples to 
 Bologna, from Pisa to Venice and Turin, in a space that by nature 
 it should be the first to allow and encourage expression 
 of opinions and critical readings of the reality that surrounds us, the 
 Student protests had to face the manganelli like 
 response to dissent, which instead sought a dialogue.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  For example is what happened at the University 
 Federico II of Naples when, following the protests for the
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 presence of the director of the newspaper "La Repubblica" Maurizio 
 Molinari, as an accomplice of the massacre, the minister 
 Lollobrigida agriculture has imaginatively argued that the 
 disputes were comparable to the political climax that brought 
 to the killing of Aldo Moro and defining them terrorist, with a 
 Great effort of imagination. This immense alarmism paints 
 a clear image: the image of a government that, paradoxically 
 wearing the mask of the defender of democracy, he proves 
 terrified by dissent, especially youthful and above all 
 when concerning the genocide taking place in Palestine.
 <p>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  On the basis of these fallacious pretexts, the minister 
 Planted did not hesitate to process a shameful access plan 
 "Limited and controlled" to the universities, which in fact would foresee 
 as a standard the presence of law enforcement agencies to the entrances of the 
 classrooms where conferences and appointments are held, with the explicit 
 purpose of repressing any dispute. Given that the 
 accusations of terrorism, which this government launches with a lightness 
 disconcerting, they should remain in the pocket to those who make themselves accomplice 
 of the genocide perpetrated by Israel, the pretext of these 
 senseless comparisons that Lollobrigida Azzarda is clear, and Mal 
 I dismantle yet another attempt to impose a turn of lives 
 securitarian and detective that suffocates dissent, armoring one of the 
 Rich in critical stimuli.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  Universities, in this political panorama that 
 more and more anguished assumes openly fascist connotations, 
 lend the side to the progressive tightening of brutality 
 police and repression of dissent. Even where they come 
 Reached victories, as happened in Turin with the retreat 
 of the University from the Maeci of collaboration Italy-Israel, 
 the controversy flock, even by professors, against the 
 governance and students, accused of being anti -Semitic and carriers 
 of hatred.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  In Venice, the Ca 'Foscari University shows 
 a conniving attitude, when not directly complicit, approximately 
 The militarization of its spaces and the warfounding propaganda 
 proposed to his students, when he "boasts" a belonging rector

<p>
  In March 1968, 56 years ago, high school student Edson Luís de Lima Souto, 18, was murdered with a shot in the chest of the chest by the Military Police (PM) at the Student Central Restaurant, the Calabouço, in the Center from Rio de Janeiro.
 </p>
<p>
  Edson was shot by the PM troop commander, aspiring Aloísio Raposo, amid the repression of a protest for bad conditions, delay in works and high prices of food in the dungeon. Another student, Benedito Frazão Dutra, was also assasted. The courageous resistance of the students was fundamental so that this would no longer become a case of "disappearance of bodies." They opposed their body to the Forensic Medical Institute (IML) and then carried it to the Legislative Assembly, challenging the fascist police. The next day, 50,000 accompanied the funeral at São João Batista cemetery.
 </p>
<p>
  The resistance of youth against the military dictatorship, in the face of the cowardly murder, multiplied, while the military recruited their campaign of attacks on the democratic rights of the people.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Popular manifestations won the repression of the regime
 </h4>
<p>
  Mobilizations took the country until Mass Day in Candelaria on April 4. The PM harshly suppressed the protesters everywhere and also attacked those who attended Mass, investing against students, workers and priests. However, in street demonstrations, it was the youth that brought advantage over the gorillas. Apparently in a situation of inferiority, the mass of young people developed techniques to circumvent gorilla repression. Still, the arrest of more than 300 students and at least three new murders scheduled the period between the march to the Rio Culture Palace on the 18th, and the demonstrations of April 21.
 </p>
<p>
  Politically worn out and unable to put an end to the rebellions of the fighting youth in the streets across the country, the military regime was forced to allow a demonstration on June 26, in Cinelândia. This date marks the Hundred Thousand March, in which the people took to the streets denouncing the death of Edson and the continuous repression and murder of students and demanding the end of the fascist military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  The military, however, responded with more attacks. In October, at the XXX Congress of the National Students Union (UNE), 700 students were arrested and charged with the National Security Law. In December of that year, the Institutional Act number 5 (AI-5) was declared, marking the beginning of the most repressive period of the dictatorship.
 </p>
<p>
  AI-5, which would only be revoked a decade later, concentrated powers in the executive and cemented the attacks on universities and students once and for all. UNE and student organizations had already been put into the illegality and political manifestation had been prohibited at universities. Congregations and university councils were instituted to ensure the complete equipment of academic (DAS) directories and student central directories (DCES). With AI-5, the expulsion and prohibition of enrollment and profession in the higher education of students and teachers involved in “subversive activities” was regulated. The goal was to suffocate and curb the entire student revolt.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The Day of the Student Fighter
 </h4>
<p>
  Edson had his life reaped by a dictatorship from which the tormentors, murderers and torturers came out amnesty, which is still celebrated by the coup barracks. If you forget this, reconciling with this same barracks, it would be not only an insult to your memory, but also to the memory of so many other young people who appear among the best children of the people, who fought fascism and were killed, such as Manoel Lisboa, Helenira Rezende and Alexandre Vannucchi Leme.
 </p>
<p>
  The masses of young Brazilians, however, do not forget, and the day of death of Edson Luís is recorded in the history of the combative struggle of youth as the combatant student day.
 </p>
<p>
  Nor could the dictatorship, with AI-5 and all the coward repression against students and other Brazilian masses, contain this struggle. Its goals were frustrated and, in fact, a substantial part of youth began to fight even more decidedly against the criminal regime and for the liberation of the Brazilian people.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Neither to forget, nor to appease
 </h4>
<p>
  As the most energetic part of the people, youth remains, even today, in struggle against the injustices of the old state. As a Putrid Excrete of the Fascist Military Regime, the PM, the army's auxiliary force, also continues to suppress harshly, and under the political and media shield of the old state and the monopolistic press, the Brazilian combative youth.

   The fascist serpent egg in the country has never been swept, never the torturers and killers, after 60 years of Golope, were condemned, benefiting from an amnesty suffocated in the blood of those who fell into a fight against the military dictatorship and could stand up APARATE OF REPRESSION that incarcerates, torture and kills youth and the other popular masses. Forgetting and appeasing, besides an insult to the memory of those who were the victim of the fascist military regime, is to give conditions for the coup, from Bolsonarist and Military Galinhas who embrace it, and fascism, already espoused by the far right of Casernna and sectors of the ruling classes and their political representatives, renew their strengths and direct against the people the most terrible attacks.

  A day after the news of the first layoffs, called 
 Voluntary releases, Stellantis returns to the office announceing another 1,087 
 Esubers: «In particular

 incentively rise to 424 employees ».
 <o:p>
</o:p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Then “after two days of meetings between Stellantis and i 
 unions we have reached almost 3,600 redundancies out of a total of about 42,700 
 employees in Italy, equal to over 8.4%. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  «Stellantis is showing that he wants to continue in his 
 Emptying strategy of plants and disengagement from our country " 
 He explains in a note Lodi, national secretary Fiom.

   He appeals to Meloni

<p>
  In recent days, a prison has been placed at the Technical University, at the Gate of Patision Street at the request of the NTUA Rectorate.
 </p>
<p>
  The guard is said to be used as a guard at the Patissia Gate, which is scheduled to reopen with the aim of improving accessibility to the "historical complex" and for its promotion.
 </p>
<p>
  No student can be convinced by this pretext. We know that the government, following a policy that followed a series of governments, is trying in every way to hit democratic rights and put the police into our schools. It abolishes asylum, passes a law on the University Police (OPPI), conducts police interventions in asylum sites every second week now and now! It puts us a permanent observer over our heads so that it can suppress any action it deems illegal (see occupation, mobilization, assembly, and even some cultural event as the prime minister himself said!) At any time. He sees all students as criminals and trumpets who make occupations determined by supposedly minorities to prevent the "smooth conduct of education" with so I want.
 </p>
<p>
  The bourgeois state seeks to tighten our straps so that people and youth cease to strive. The government, with this move, is trying to terrorize students by putting a "babble" in the space that pass through half and more, in a place that socialize, politicize, organize their struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  We can in no way believe that the prison is placed on the gate for tourist purposes nor for the "improvement" of the complex. It is well known that the system's pursuit of converting places of the popular movement of the popular movement into museums, sterilize and terrorize them. All that is missing from the Lower Technical University is a cop-guy in the school!
 </p>
<p>
  Those who talk about "upgrade" are the ones who crush our right to free and public education. They are the ones who put the knife on our neck and do not let us study in human terms. This rotten policy does not act for our benefit, but only oppose our demands.
 </p>
<p>
  To remove the prison from the Patissia Gate!
 </p>
<p>
  Outside the cops from our schools - down the hands of asylum

     The old 
 Ecuadorian State made an attack against the peasant communities of 
 Palo burning and the pampas. Providing services to their imperialist masters and for 
 impose bureaucratic capitalism, the State concessioned 2,200 hectares to the 
 MINERA COMPANY - CANADIENSE LA PLATA S.A. and according to the collective by water

 Ecuadorian government signed at least six commitments with Canada for more than 
 4.8 billion dollars. This data reaffirms the total subjection of the State

     For the companions of the Front of Struggles

 He attacked the peasantry on March 19 and 20, arresting around 
 72 people who accuse of terrorism. Contrary to what the 
 old state, this action has not been able to stop resistance, on the contrary, 
 masses set two vehicles from the imperialist lackeys and injured six 
 Police and military. The FDLP-E analyzes the situation:
     <i>
      "Let's open the 
 Eyes, the world is going through several imperialist invasions against peoples 
 oppressed Imperialism wishes to seize our main means of 
 production, land and everything that contains it, stripping of their plots to 
 Our peasants. Then, the town of Palo Quemado-Las Pampas its 
 main contradiction is against imperialism, against semi -feudality and 
 against bureaucratic capitalism, in that order. We can't trust a gram 
 of rice in the institutions of the old state, all are at the service of 
 Imperialism and power groups, nor of the Armed Forces and Police 
 National who point their weapons to the poorest in the country for the benefit of the 
 exploitative. And they will not hesitate to pull the trigger. In contrast, there is the 
 proletariat, poor peasants, democratic intellectuals, the people 
 Aguerrido, who undertake the anti -imperialist struggle for the Pacha Mama. ”

 Our Abya Yala, today known as "America." The lackeys of 
 Imperialism in our lands celebrate this day forgetting the barbarism that the 
 odious Spanish monarchy imposed on the peoples of Anahuac (today called 
 Mexico) and other territories of our America. The "culture" that 
 landowners and the Creole bourgeoisie celebrate in their official acts it is, in 
 Essence, the culture of subordination to colonialists. The masses

 Democratic teaching of section XXII of the SNTE-CNTE to organizations 
 democratic and independent unions on March 4 and 5 we made in 
 The city of Oaxaca the first phase of our fighting day in defense of 
 the rights of the people. This has consisted of contingent mobilization 
 from various regions of the rebel Oaxaca in the city of the 
 Resistance under the slogan: flood the streets and squares with red flags! 
 As we said before, this mobilization has been an answer 
 in the absence of solution to the demands of justice and the repression that 
 loom about the popular movement and the peoples of Oaxaca. In this way, 
 contingents from regions such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the basin, 
 La Costa, the Sierra Sur, Mixteca and the central valleys gathered

   Speech made in 1940 to his companions in the Ocaña prison
  </h5>
<p>
   "You know, comrades in sorrows, fatigues and longings, that the word homage smells of a statue in a public square and of bourgeois vanity. I don't think anyone among us has tried to honor any of us today, as we come together, in the savory satisfaction of eating as a family. It's about something else. And I don't want this meal to give us any reason to utter words of strange significance about our revolutionary way of being. This meal is a just reward for the many merits made in his life as a spectre by one of us, during the twenty-five days that he has entailed with himself, with the patience of an actual dead man, there, in the afterlife of this prison. The hunger that I have brought from that ghostly life to this other real life of a prisoner: the hunger that I have brought, and that does not leave my nature, well deserves the reception the size of a cow: Of course; As a poet, I have noticed the absence of laurel... in the condiments.
  </p>
<p>
   For the rest, the laurel detail does not matter, since for my temples I will always prefer some noble grayans. We are, therefore, that today it has corresponded to me to be a pretext to affirm, on a solid food base, our need for fraternal collaboration in all aspects and from all the plans and aride of our life. Today that the people pass, who can pass, through the most delicate and difficult trance of its existence, although also the most sobering and probative of their temper, I want to provide with you. We will provide for the happiness of this town: for what is closest to collective happiness.
  </p>
<p>
   You know. We need to provide. And we have neither wine nor glass. But, now, at the same time, we can lift our fists, clandestinely, and sorry. There is no glass that can contain without breaking the single drink that fits in a fist: hate. The overflowing hatred that we feel before these walls representatives of such injustice: the hatred that spills from our fists on these walls: that will spill. The hatred that illuminates with its energetic vital force the forehead and look and horizons of the worker. But, severely, we will take care of us that this hatred is not that of instinct and the unferentized passion. That original hatred only leads to the jungle. And our hatred is not the tiger that devastates: it is the hammer that builds. Let's go, then, to provide ». Miguel Hernández

   from the manifesto
  </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A week of protest was enough for 
 make the us usually measured minister of the University lose your head e 
 of the research Anna Maria Bernini who yesterday, alarmed by two 
 disputes simultaneously, in Rome and Genoa, thought of calling 
 the police chief Vittorio Pisani for a comparison on the "situation 
  within the universities ".
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An irrews that, in addition to 
 seem a rude to the competent minister, planted, betrays the 
 nervousness of the right government in front of the mobilizations of young people. 
  Only 18 months have passed since Meloni, in his speech of 
 settlement said "contest me, be hungry, be crazy and also 
 free »to young people. An evident boutade that has not convinced anyone 
 also because already a few days later the chronicles recorded the use of 
 Manganelli against students.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Yesterday Minister Bernini had to 
 demonstrate to adhere to the government's majority party line

 who for days, in confidential communications, has asked his of his 
 publicly support the thesis that university protests for the

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An indication that, in the intentions, 
 it should serve to diminish the strong anti-war instances of the movement 
  student who, after Naples and Turin, has occupied the 
  Sapienza and manifested in Genoa to ask for the interruption of the announcement 
 of collaboration between Italy and Israel (Maeci) and relations with 
 Leonardo and Med-Or Foundation, chaired by Marco Minniti.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
   What you can
  </strong>
  The 
 government pretends not to see is that the mobilization against the 
 militarization of Italian universities starts from long before the 
 contingency of the news and the massacre of the population of Gaza has it 
 made only more urgent. Even two years ago, at the end of March 2022, the first 
 University of the capital was occupied to protest against 
 the escalation in Ukraine with the request to cut the agreements between 
 Sapienza and Leonardo.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In addition to the PNRR, there is also a PNRM, 
 National Plan of Military Research, involving Ministries of 
 Defense and education and university. The central role of the system 
 university for strengthening the military sector is emphasized 
 also from the programmatic document 2020-22 of the General Staff of 
 Defence. Also in 2022 a protocol between crui was signed 
 (Conference of Rectors) and Leonardo Med-Or to intensify the 
 collaboration.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  According to the data published on the website of 
  same aerospace group, at the moment Leonardo has a 
 sixty research projects with the Italian universities plus five 
 Framework agreements with as many universities (Polimi, Polito, La Sapienza, 
 University of Genoa and Bologna). The army also moved: the 
 Federico II of Naples, for example, has long started an agreement-four 
  with the center high studies for the defense (Casd) and the Operations Command 
 On the Network of the General Staff to develop common projects.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As the No Muos movement explains 
 Sicilian in a recent dossier on university and war, the slip 
 from knowledge as a place of peace to the knowledge for war is due 
  to the intertwining of different interests: «The merely economic one e 
 Remunction: the war companies that finance research do not do it 
  in a disinterested way but they create profit and can draw on a 
 large basin of interns and trainees to be used at their own 
 structures; Another end is political and propaganda, with one 
 universities that lends itself on the one hand to legitimize aggressions 
 imperialist and, on the other, to spread the culture of defense and 
  safety in the territories, which serves to normalize the war and its 
 consequences".
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>
   The Observatory
  </strong>
  against 
 the militarization of the schools, which for years has collected and archives the 
 reports on the interference of the police in education, has 
  launched a petition last January, «outside the universities from 
 Med -or/Leonardo, producer of weapons and death », to ask 
 rectors to give up their positions within the foundation he has 
 Over thirty thousand signatures collected.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  “When university research is 
 financed by this type of companies, direct relapse is on the projects of 
  research that are bound by the strategic choices of companies that 
 they aim the growth of the war sector in a context in which 
 the under the public funding of the universities puts the crisis in crisis 
 universities, "says Margherita Esposito of the Union of University students, while 
  the collective change course, the architect of the actions of the last 
 days, call to mass mobilization for April 16.

  No step back from Hungarian justice: the Court of Budapest has denied house arrest in Ilaria, it means that it will remain in prison, where it has been imprisoned for thirteen months, in the conditions that we have known and above all without any conviction, only a precautionary measure of prison prison.

 Once again Ilaria was brought to the hearing in total waste of human rights,
 <b>
  dragged like a dog held on a leash by riot police in camouflage suit with balaclava
 </b>
 who sat near her for the duration of the hearing.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Those images, once again, seem to come from a place very far from the rule of law that should characterize the Member States of the European Union.
 </p>
<p>
  Orban knew very well that the Ilaria Salis chains would have made the tour of Europe again and, therefore, the message is clear: it works like this, nobody intrudes; With us the dissent is punished like this.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, what happened this morning in Budapest also outside the courtroom with threats and intimidations towards people who arrived from Italy to give solidarity to Ilaria, confirm the iniquity and the massacre of this procedure that has nothing to do with a state of law.
 </p>
<p>
  The lawyer Losco, defender of Ilaria, the father of Ilaria and Zerocalcare, present in support of our compatriot, were welcomed by threats by Nazi groups present outside and inside the courtroom. Intimidations as "what you look at, we split your face" are the threats addressed to them.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The refusal of house arrest is bad news because it forces Ilaria still in prison despite having been identified an apartment and given all the economic guarantees.
 </p>
<p>
  The conditions of violation of human rights are evident. It is evident to everyone that Hungary is not respecting the European Convention on Human Rights whose failure to observe has already cost other convictions to Hungary but apparently, in Orban, respect for European agreements does not affect.
 </p>
<p>
  Is this the state that our president considers a model to be emitted?
 </p>
<p>
  The patriotism of our government goes to alternating current, with the town Ilaria Salis does not activate.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   A day that writes a history of violation of rights for Italy and for Europe.
  </b>
</p>

<b>
   Bitterness and anger at this decision.

 The NAP for Communist Liberation bids farewell to Comrade Nikos Adamopoulos who passed away on the morning of Thursday, March 28, 2024. An unexpected and heavy loss that caused deep pain to all of us and all of us who met with him in his steady course. in the labor and communist movement.
 <br>
<br>
 Nikos Adamopoulos was born in 1958. His origin was from Antiparos.
 <br>
<br/>
 Nikos was a "mature child of rage". He came from a working -class family, his father worked at the Lignite Mine in Anthoupoli in Peristeri, so -called "charcoal". He lived in the early years of his life with his family in the shacks that the miners lived before the mine was closed.
 <br/>
<br/>
 He was in a night school when he was organized in KNE in 1974 and later became a member of the KKE. He worked actively in the KNE's Patision-Kypseli sector with various charges. He then took responsibility for the cultural Council at the Athens Council Council of KNE and responsible for the cultural festival. His contribution to another labor culture was great through these positions. Since 1985 he has been an alternate member of the KNE CS.
 <br/>
<br/>
 He did not accept the submission of the reformist left, the Coalition and the KKE, with the governments of Tzannetakis and Zolotas and took part in the "KNE rebellion". He joined NAP since the first moment of his assembly in 1989 and was an active executive. In NAP's 34-year course, Nikos has always been present at dozens of duties and charges. Participated in a series of bodies and committees. She was a member of the Political Committee and her office at various times, including the outgoing IP before the recent 5th Congress of the Organization. Just a few days ago we remember his intervention at the NAP Congress.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Nikos starred in the Labor Movement in the field of OTAs. He was a member of the Board of Directors for many years and then president of the Workers' Association in the Municipality of Nea Ionia Attica, from 1998 to 2000 and from 2002 to 2016 when he retired. He had been elected with the "Racing Movements-Responses to the Local Authorities" at the WTO-OTA General Council from 2007 to 2015, to the Federation Executive Committee from 2012 to 2015, as well as the ADEDY Executive Committee in 2015-2016 with the ballot paper of the interventions in the State. With his action in the labor and trade union movement, he contributed decisively to the promotion of the perception of the new labor movement, the coordination of unions and the class struggle.
 <br/>
<br/>
 He was elected a regional councilor of Attica with the "anti -capitalist overthrow in Attica" where he acted decisively. He was also a member of the Pan -Hellenic Coordinating Body and ANTARSYA's CSE in previous years.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Nikos Adamopoulos was distinguished for his dedication to the revolutionary affair of the working class, his militancy and his determination to fight to beat the working class and not just to protest.
 <br/>
<br/>
 He consciously supported the goal and work for a modern communist program and party. We will remember Nikos always close to youth, struggles and agony, in front of the demonstrations, with his experience and sensory for a movement that will not fold but overturn the urban attack.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It will be very missing, because he had a lot to give. He left standing up and so we will remember him. It will be in everything we do, along with the comrades we lost earlier.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In these difficult times our thoughts are in his own people, to our beloved comrades and companions, to whom NAP expresses the warmest condolences.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We are committed to Comrade Nikos, all and all your companions, that we will walk steadily on the way of labor emancipation and communist liberation as you have always tired, fighter, stubbornly until the last hour.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Comrade Nikos' political funeral will take place on Saturday March 30th at the First Cemetery. There will be information for the exact time.

<p>
  Residents of the Cumbique community, in the municipality of Raposa, reported on March 7, to the Agência Tambor portal, the crimes against the people and the natural environment committed by Construtora Canopus. Residents denounce food insecurity, housing destruction and pollution in a preservation area.
 </p>
<p>
  In the region is being built a condominium, Residencial Village by do Sol, and since then the population has reported a worsening of quality of life due to the losses generated by the work. The mangrove and streams, a tributary of the Patience River, are being contaminated, preventing residents from being able to take their livelihoods and food through seafood collection.
 </p>
<p>
  In an interview with the Tambor newspaper, Wilton Neves, resident of Cumbique, tells a little about the damage that the work caused, in two years. “It came to mess our mangrove. My mother's house fell, invaded by mud water of this construction. The boats are jammed with so much mud. Fishermen cannot fish. They respect nothing and no one, ”said the interviewee.
 </p>
<p>
  Being a fishing community, the extraction activity is the main source of income of the population. Residents are mobilized and seek justice so that the work is discontinued.
 </p>
<p>
  Often, large business groups interrupt the life of communities, with the endorsement of the state. Under the guise of bringing “development and innovation” to regions, they bring the destruction of the natural environment and the violation of peasants. Even in the face of serious complaint, Canopus Construções follows unpunished and without giving answers on the cases.

 With sadness we were informed of the sudden loss of S. Nikos Adamopoulos, NAP executive, on the morning of Thursday, March 28th.
 <br>
<br>
 Born in 1958, S. Nikos, raised in a working family, was organized since his teenage years in the KNE and later in the KKE. He left in 1989, after the KKE participated in the Governments of Tzanetakis and Zolotas and joined NAP from his constitution, being an active executive, to the end.
 <br>
<br>
 Nikos Adamopoulos, an active trade unionist, has been president of the Workers' Association of the Municipality of Nea Ionia for many years, where he worked until his retirement. He was a member of the WTO-OTA General Council and a regional councilor with the anti-capitalist overthrow in Attica. We met S. Nikos in the struggles of the People's Movement with his party capacity and worked with him on a trade union level, in the struggles of the public workers.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The memory of S. Nikos Adamopoulos will remain alive in the struggles of the popular labor movement.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We express our heartfelt condolences to his relatives and his comrades.
 <p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the city of Solingen near the North Rhine-Westphalian state capital of Düsseldorf, an arson attack on an apartment building occurred on Monday night in the mostly Muslim Bulgarians with Turkish roots. In total, an entire family was killed in the arson attack and nine other people were seriously injured. The dead are a couple of parents aged 28 and 29 as well as their three -year -old child and a five -month -old infant. The remaining nine seriously injured people are also Bulgarian citizens.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The fire was laid on Monday with the help of fire accelerators in the lower staircase and quickly spread to the attic in which the killed family lived. Other house residents could only save themselves in front of the fire by saving themselves like a family from the third floor by jumping into the outside, in which they were seriously injured both by the fire and the jump.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/brandstiftung-feuer-in-solingen-wurde-laut-staatsanwaltschaft-vorsaetzlich-gelegt-100.html">
   At the present time, the public prosecutor sees "no indications of a xenophobic motif".
  </a>
  And that despite the fact that a fire in the stairwell was deliberately laid a year and a half before, but that at that time it could be quickly discovered and deleted. She does not justify why the public prosecutor's office in the usual civil servant excludes a racist background of the crime. Meanwhile, migrant and anti -fascist initiatives protested in front of the house that criticize exactly that. In a published statement
  <a href="https://taz.de/Toedlicher-Brandanschlag-in-Solingen/!6001114/">
   write them in relation to the statements of the Solingen public prosecutor
  </a>
<em>
   "After the experience with the murderous arson attack of Solingen in 1993, after the NSU murders, to Hanau and Halle differently" (...) "Reminds the current racist mobilization-not just us-of the social mood of the nineties before Rostock, Mölln and Solingen. "
  </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And rightly justify these initiatives and put the recent ars at the context of other fascist and racist attacks. The fact that a house in the mostly Muslim Bulgarian life becomes the victim of an arson attack and is not supposed to be a racist motive behind it is quite unlikely on the basis of the current reactionaryization of the German state and the high of the fascist mass movement. After all, it is above all the traffic light government that in recent months the keywords from the right opposition around AfD and Co.In implement the practice and run a division and chauvinistic agitation against migrants in general and especially against Arabs and Muslims. In addition, hatred against Southeast Europeans from Bulgaria and Romania and especially against Roma and Sinti has a permanent economy in the FRG.
 </p>
<p a="" href="/index.php/de/t-brd/8331-nrw-razzia-gegen-arbeiter-in-essen" style="text-align: justify;">
  As we saw, for example, at the raid against the workers' and poor families in Essen, who also come from Southeast Europe
  .
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  These are just a few examples such as the politics of German imperialism as a pioneer and fire accelerator serves for fascist and racist attacks. Whether it was a racist act or not, the arson attack in Solingen is a crime against the working class and the people in the FRG. A crime of which is worth the high government politicians of not huge word of condolences or grief. But that also has a long tradition in Germany, because in 1993 the last racist arson attack in Solingen in which five people were murdered said the then CDU Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the demand why he did not comment on "I also know God others Events."
