  In the city of Solingen near the North Rhine-Westphalian state capital of Düsseldorf, an arson attack on an apartment building occurred on Monday night in the mostly Muslim Bulgarians with Turkish roots. In total, an entire family was killed in the arson attack and nine other people were seriously injured. The dead are a couple of parents aged 28 and 29 as well as their three -year -old child and a five -month -old infant. The remaining nine seriously injured people are also Bulgarian citizens.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  The fire was laid on Monday with the help of fire accelerators in the lower staircase and quickly spread to the attic in which the killed family lived. Other house residents could only save themselves in front of the fire by saving themselves like a family from the third floor by jumping into the outside, in which they were seriously injured both by the fire and the jump.

  <a href="https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/brandstiftung-feuer-in-solingen-wurde-laut-staatsanwaltschaft-vorsaetzlich-gelegt-100.html">
   At the present time, the public prosecutor sees "no indications of a xenophobic motif".
  </a>
  And that despite the fact that a fire in the stairwell was deliberately laid a year and a half before, but that at that time it could be quickly discovered and deleted. She does not justify why the public prosecutor's office in the usual civil servant excludes a racist background of the crime. Meanwhile, migrant and anti -fascist initiatives protested in front of the house that criticize exactly that. In a published statement
  <a href="https://taz.de/Toedlicher-Brandanschlag-in-Solingen/!6001114/">
   write them in relation to the statements of the Solingen public prosecutor
  </a>
  <em>
   "After the experience with the murderous arson attack of Solingen in 1993, after the NSU murders, to Hanau and Halle differently" (...) "Reminds the current racist mobilization-not just us-of the social mood of the nineties before Rostock, Mölln and Solingen. "
  </em>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  And rightly justify these initiatives and put the recent ars at the context of other fascist and racist attacks. The fact that a house in the mostly Muslim Bulgarian life becomes the victim of an arson attack and is not supposed to be a racist motive behind it is quite unlikely on the basis of the current reactionaryization of the German state and the high of the fascist mass movement. After all, it is above all the traffic light government that in recent months the keywords from the right opposition around AfD and Co.In implement the practice and run a division and chauvinistic agitation against migrants in general and especially against Arabs and Muslims. In addition, hatred against Southeast Europeans from Bulgaria and Romania and especially against Roma and Sinti has a permanent economy in the FRG.
 </p>
 <p a="" href="/index.php/de/t-brd/8331-nrw-razzia-gegen-arbeiter-in-essen" style="text-align: justify;">
  As we saw, for example, at the raid against the workers' and poor families in Essen, who also come from Southeast Europe
  .
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  These are just a few examples such as the politics of German imperialism as a pioneer and fire accelerator serves for fascist and racist attacks. Whether it was a racist act or not, the arson attack in Solingen is a crime against the working class and the people in the FRG. A crime of which is worth the high government politicians of not huge word of condolences or grief. But that also has a long tradition in Germany, because in 1993 the last racist arson attack in Solingen in which five people were murdered said the then CDU Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the demand why he did not comment on "I also know God others Events."
