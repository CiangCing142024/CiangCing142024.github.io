  The reaction of this government in the face of the legitimate expression of 
 dissent by students and university students in 
 against a state that is currently perpetrating a genocide 
 In Palestine, he demonstrates his more unequivocal way 
 fascist nature, well beyond rhetoric, which aims to repress 
 any type of dissent that threatens its economic interests e 
 geopolitics.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  The student disputes of these weeks 
 In fact, they are narrated as "antechamber of terrorism in Italy", 
 until the at least imaginative "infiltrations of the 
 Red brigades inside universities ". This goes to 
 legitimize the militarized repression implemented against 
 protests within universities, places of knowledge that 
 abdicate their critical role towards what is 
 happening, and protecting students and students. From Naples to 
 Bologna, from Pisa to Venice and Turin, in a space that by nature 
 it should be the first to allow and encourage expression 
 of opinions and critical readings of the reality that surrounds us, the 
 Student protests had to face the manganelli like 
 response to dissent, which instead sought a dialogue.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  For example is what happened at the University 
 Federico II of Naples when, following the protests for the

 presence of the director of the newspaper "La Repubblica" Maurizio 
 Molinari, as an accomplice of the massacre, the minister 
 Lollobrigida agriculture has imaginatively argued that the 
 disputes were comparable to the political climax that brought 
 to the killing of Aldo Moro and defining them terrorist, with a 
 Great effort of imagination. This immense alarmism paints 
 a clear image: the image of a government that, paradoxically 
 wearing the mask of the defender of democracy, he proves 
 terrified by dissent, especially youthful and above all 
 when concerning the genocide taking place in Palestine.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  On the basis of these fallacious pretexts, the minister 
 Planted did not hesitate to process a shameful access plan 
 "Limited and controlled" to the universities, which in fact would foresee 
 as a standard the presence of law enforcement agencies to the entrances of the 
 classrooms where conferences and appointments are held, with the explicit 
 purpose of repressing any dispute. Given that the 
 accusations of terrorism, which this government launches with a lightness 
 disconcerting, they should remain in the pocket to those who make themselves accomplice 
 of the genocide perpetrated by Israel, the pretext of these 
 senseless comparisons that Lollobrigida Azzarda is clear, and Mal 
 I dismantle yet another attempt to impose a turn of lives 
 securitarian and detective that suffocates dissent, armoring one of the 
 Rich in critical stimuli.

  Universities, in this political panorama that 
 more and more anguished assumes openly fascist connotations, 
 lend the side to the progressive tightening of brutality 
 police and repression of dissent. Even where they come 
 Reached victories, as happened in Turin with the retreat 
 of the University from the Maeci of collaboration Italy-Israel, 
 the controversy flock, even by professors, against the 
 governance and students, accused of being anti -Semitic and carriers 
 of hatred.

  In Venice, the Ca 'Foscari University shows 
 a conniving attitude, when not directly complicit, approximately

   We refuse to suffer this progressive 
 militarization in silence, we will not let violence instigated 
 by a government frightened by dissent suffocates our voices and the 
 our claims, which ask for the end of a genocide. The 
 We have already done and we will do it again until it is necessary: there 
 We will take every space and we will do it by any means necessary, this
