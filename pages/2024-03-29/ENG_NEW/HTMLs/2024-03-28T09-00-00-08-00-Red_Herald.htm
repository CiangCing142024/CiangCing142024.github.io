   As it can be seen, this is not the first time that the morenist government of Martínez Neri hits our comrades, be it in the commerce sector, the trash recollection sector or the people’s colonies. The same happens with other democratic organizations and residents of the city affected by the fact that the municipal government is integrated by several characters that started in the people’s movements and now they are transformed in millionaire and repressive people. Day after day, the residents of Oaxaca understand more that the municipal government is an opportunist government, that everyday is more far from the people. The image of the one who was a publisher in UABJO during the social conflict on 2006 fells by its own weight, letting to be seen his new entrepreneur and enemy of the people’s movement face. No one should doubt on that,
   <strong>
    there will be an organized answer by the people! Stop the harassment and repression against our comrades! Down with the electoral bourgeois farce! Neri,
   </strong>
   <strong>
    represser
   </strong>
   <strong>
    ! Not a single vote to Neri!
   </strong>
   <strong>
    Do not
   </strong>
   <strong>
    vote –
   </strong>
   <strong>
    organize and struggle!
   </strong>
