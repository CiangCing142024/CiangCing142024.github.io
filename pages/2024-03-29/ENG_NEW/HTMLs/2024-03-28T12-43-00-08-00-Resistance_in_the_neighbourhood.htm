   At first, 
  I never expected to imprison for so much. Before my conviction, 
 Within a period of three years, I was in prison for 17 months. After 
 The conviction, I stayed in prison for 7 years. Total, nearly 8.5 
 years in the last 10 years.

   Still 
  And if one is guilty of some crime, it is huge 
 penalty. But in our case, for no reason or reason, 
 We were imprisoned for such a long time. Maybe nobody out too 
 Do not expect to suffer such hassle for so much. The criminal 
 Procedure has made a punishment in itself.

   After 
  the first mandate [of the Supreme Court] for my release,

   First
 I suffered from brachial plexus paralysis. There was a rupture of the nervous 
system that connects the shoulder to the brain because of the 
ill-treatment by the police when they kidnapped and arrested me. This
 It hurt my shoulder. I can't lift my left hand. I can't
 to do nothing with it. I can't keep a book.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Because of
 of destruction of the nervous system, muscles were also affected 
of the shoulder. Because of pulling and trauma, my left ribs
 They were crowded and crushed. These hit the lungs. With the 
Their turn, these affected my heart, and hit the left side 
her. But my backbone was also affected, because the ribs 
They were crushed in a small spot.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   All
 This side of my body has been affected. In the last 10 years, 
I feel severe pain in my left arm and leg. Because of its destruction 
nervous system and muscles, my left shoulder is paralyzed 
completely.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Because of 
  The effect on my left lung, sleep apnea began. From the 
 Nose to the lungs, the path of breathing was affected. This 
 caused a obstructive sleep apnea. Because of this, I can't 
 sleep.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   I have 
  suffer a state of the heart called hypertrophic 
 Cardiomyopathy, which had not been detected in any medicine 
 exam before I throw in prison. As a result of this, the left side 
 The heart works only with 55% of its ability. Began and 
 high blood pressure because the heart wall could not 
 push the blood quite a bit into my body.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   That's all 
  In ten years, I developed a bladder in the brain. It is not much 
 serious, at present, however, could be done at any time 
 malignant.

 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Found
 Also, kidney stones due to limited life and difficulties 
movement without the possibility of exercise or any physical 
activity in prison. Although the stones were crushed, cysts 
formed in the right kidney.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   I still developed bile stones due to a lack of feeding for long periods. This led to pancreatitis.

 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   THE 
  list is endless. All of these diseases were developed in prison. 
 Until I went out there was no proper medical care these ten 
 years. Therefore, I suffer from multiple diseases.

  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   He needs 
  Now to have this medical care. It all depends on how now,

  will remain affected and will be able to be carried out. This will 
 See.

 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   The 
  Next days, I will be in hospitals for exams and treatments. 
 We do not know how much it will get and to what extent I will recover.

    Why 
  You were not able to access proper medical care 
 in prison; Why were you not given a guarantee suspension, for medical 
 reasons;

  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   THE 
  This suspension was rejected twice by the Supreme Court. However, 
 had been written in the decision to reject the suspension that I should have 
 Regular and appropriate medical care.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Nevertheless, 
  Prison authorities ignored and violated the decision. Although with 
 They sent to Nagpour Medical School several times, it was about 
 Something typical and rough. I was just going and returning. With this, 
 They showed that they were trying to provide me with treatment, but there was no 
 treatment.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   If 
  See my medical history, you will see how medical care 
 It was avoided and not provided. In the end, just before I release, every 
 section wrote that [this treatment or medicine] are not available, not 
 We can do this, it's available elsewhere. Why doctors wrote 
 Only at the end of the ten years that they couldn't heal me? I will 
 They had to report it ten years ago.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Not 
  they did anything but to give me painkillers and put me 
 sleep. If the treatment was not available to them at the beginning of ten 
 years, they had to have written it and ask to be transferred to 
 A suitable hospital available.

 <p align="JUSTIFY">
  <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   THE 
  Picture that prison authorities and state mechanism were trying 
 to give it was that I was somebody's notorious terrorist - a 
 "Brain" of international Maoism. Each type of characterization 
 used to terrorize prisoners, officers 
 of prison and the guards. They wanted to keep me isolated.
