   THE 
  Class course expresses its solidarity in the struggle given by 
 LARCO employees and their families for the right to 
 work and life.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a fight they have been waging for years against
  <b>
   LARCO's deliberate depreciation and sale process,
  </b>
  both by the ND government and from the previous ones (SYRIZA, 
 PASOK etc.). This approach is that has led LARCO to be 
 For two years off, in a 'special management' regime 
 and her workers waiting with constant extensions.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Now, 
  850 workers are in danger of being on the road as on March 31 
  expire their contracts and no one is committed to what will 
 they get off.
  </b>
  <br/>
  This development will have tragic consequences not only for 
  workers and their families, but also for all the surrounding 
 area. How will they live? Where will they stay? How will they pay the loans? How 
 Will their children study?
 </p>
 <p>
  These questions are asked by the reality and with mass struggle they must be answered.
  <b>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Struggle to maintain all jobs and all labor rights.
  </b>
  <b>
   <br/>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Against
  </b>
  In
 Hostage of workers, defeatism, terrorism and 
blackmail to accept the deterioration of working conditions for his own sake 
any "investor-savior".
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Against
  </b>
  In hunger programs 
  of DBA (formerly OAED) which is raw mockery for workers and 
 They aim to disorient them and eventually get rid of them.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Against
  </b>
  to 
  Anti-labor-Antilaular Policy that behind the talk about 
 'Development' hides the black reality of poverty, unemployment 
 and desolation. Is the same policy that left their fate 
 Thousands of fields in Thessaly after the devastating floods.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Mass
 and unyielding struggle for the right to full and stable work,
 with decent wages and working conditions, and all safety measures.
  </b>
  <br/>
  THE 
  LARCO employees' power is in the massage and 
 Scaling their fight! The support and solidarity by the people and the 
 The world of work is important and must be given!
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   THE 
 Righteous struggle of LARCO workers is a race of all 
 working class and as such should be supported by the whole 
 workers.
