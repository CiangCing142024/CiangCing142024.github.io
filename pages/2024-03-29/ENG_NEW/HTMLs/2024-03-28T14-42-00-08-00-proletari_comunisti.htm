  The Army of Israel bombed the headquarters of the
  <i>
   General Federation of Palestinian unions (Pgftu)
  </i>
  in the city of Gaza. The headquarters of the
  <i>
   Pgftu
  </i>
  provided 
  crucial services [to the whole population], including a kindergarten for 380 
  children and a bakery that served many families. It is the third time 
 that the general headquarters of the
  <i>
   Pgftu
  </i>
  It undergoes such a destruction, the previous attacks had occurred during the Israeli bombing of Gaza in 2014.
 </p>
 <p>
  Beyond the main building, three locations were destroyed
  <i>
   Pgftu
  </i>
  In the 
  Al-Riosal and Via Yarmouk district. The attack hit, beyond the 
  buildings, the means of subsistence and the rights of Palestinian workers. 
  However, Palestinian workers remain still on their positions: 
 We will persevere in our struggle for justice and dignity.

 <p>
  While we prepare to celebrate the

   <i>
    Palestinian earth day

   <i>
    Great return march
   </i>
   of 2018
  </a>
  , 
  We continue to forcefully ask the unions and workers of everything 
 The world to stay by our side. We ask all the people of 
 awareness of ending the complicity with the crimes of Israel, a 
 begin with the immediate cessation of the weapon trade.

   Both the

   they have 
  a profound meaning for our people, because they remember the 
 our long struggle for the justice and the realization of ours 
 inalienable rights. In the face of the Israeli genocide and attempts 
 of ethnic cleaning in Gaza, it is essential to reaffirm the centrality of the 
  right to return for all Palestinians. Most of the 
 Palestinians, including those of Gaza, are refugees, and their right 
 Upon returning to its original houses, it remains at the center of the struggle 
 Palestinian.

  While we prepare for these commemorations, we are faced with the 
 Streeting situation of Gaza. The uninterrupted bombings and the 
 intentional hungry tactics of Israel reveal nature 
 genocida of his aggression, and unload on workers the 
 heavier consequences. The forced evacuation of the Palestinians 
 from the northern area of Gaza, together with the indiscriminate attacks 
 Against displaced people and vital infrastructures, they are a clear attempt 
  ethnic cleaning, a continuation of the
  <i>
   Nakba
  </i>
  of 1948.

  In Palestine it is a coordination of 30 workers unions e 
 Palestinian professional associations who have launched an appeal 
 unitary to put an end to any complicity with the state of "Israel" and a 
 stop by "Israel".

 <p>
  We take note of the declarations and actions of the trade union movement in response
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/F8rvPYfscBbK1Vws/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   to the initial appeal of the Palestinian unions in October
  </a>
  And 
  We pay homage to all those who have lined up alongside the 
 Palestinian people. These acts of solidarity, both with the words and 
 with the actions, they are in continuity with the great tradition 
 of union internationalism. However, it is necessary to do more: 
 during the
  <i>
   Earth Day
  </i>
  We ask for an intensification of actions to end the genocide. It is essential to undermine
  <b>
   Not only the sale and financing of weapons in Israel
  </b>
  , but also
  <b>
   the
  </b>
  <b>
   transport of these weapons and other key materials used by the Israeli army
  </b>
  To impose his brutal and illegal siege.
 </p>
 <p>
  We ask workers and unions of the whole world to mobilize for the
  <i>
   Earth Day
  </i>
  <i>
   2024
  </i>
  through:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <b>
    The refusal of participation in the production and transport of weapons
   </b>
   destined 
  a/or from Israel; interrupting the logistics of the operations 
  military of Israel, we can prevent his ability to exercise 
 Further violence against our people.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>
    The clash with the complicity of the governments that perpetuate Israel's aggression
   </b>
   . 
  This includes the dispute of the release of licenses for the sale of 
 weapons, and protests at defense and foreign ministries. THE 
 governments must be held responsible for their role in 
 facilitate the genocide of Israel.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>
    The intensification of all effective trade union actions
   </b>
   â€“ Passing motions, agitating in workplaces, organizing education sessions and networking.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Despite the horror of the genocide perpetrated by Israel and his 
 daily crimes against the Palestinians, we cannot sell to 
 Despair nor deviate our attention [from this]. In reverse, 
 To celebrate this historic day for the Palestinian people in the 
 our liberation struggle, we must renew our commitment to 
 remain united as workers against injustice.
