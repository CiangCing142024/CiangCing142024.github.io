We know that the government, following a policy that followed a series of governments, is trying in every way to hit democratic rights and put the police into our schools. It abolishes asylum, passes a law on the University Police (OPPI), conducts police interventions in asylum sites every second week now and now! It puts us a permanent observer over our heads so that it can suppress any action it deems illegal (see occupation, mobilization, assembly, and even some cultural event as the prime minister himself said!) At any time. He sees all students as criminals and trumpets who make occupations determined by supposedly minorities to prevent the \"smooth conduct of education\" with so I want.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bourgeois state seeks to tighten our straps so that people and youth cease to strive. The government, with this move, is trying to terrorize students by putting a \"babble\" in the space that pass through half and more, in a place that socialize, politicize, organize their struggle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We can in no way believe that the prison is placed on the gate for tourist purposes nor for the \"improvement\" of the complex. It is well known that the system's pursuit of converting places of the popular movement of the popular movement into museums, sterilize and terrorize them. All that is missing from the Lower Technical University is a cop-guy in the school!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Those who talk about \"upgrade\" are the ones who crush our right to free and public education. They are the ones who put the knife on our neck and do not let us study in human terms. This rotten policy does not act for our benefit, but only oppose our demands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To remove the prison from the Patissia Gate!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outside the cops from our schools - down the hands of asylum\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"672\" data-original-width=\"1920\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7lo0ITZ33Qfpd57WybjX0HYsLZy8kgtnhc1XwWqurLAMf0K4JjrqDUEMmaVFl0LnySBMLcwHKZ4lOZ_aD5FWODZsTG6wmoBu_Ig-CMr2Dh6t3qfsTK-bCSc9xu6XS-nBrNsGlyPpazoAdvMwj7jAUL3-LoOiPf3KkrpcO_q8aL9ql3d6RVCzYcUQPh6A/s1920/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7lo0ITZ33Qfpd57WybjX0HYsLZy8kgtnhc1XwWqurLAMf0K4JjrqDUEMmaVFl0LnySBMLcwHKZ4lOZ_aD5FWODZsTG6wmoBu_Ig-CMr2Dh6t3qfsTK-bCSc9xu6XS-nBrNsGlyPpazoAdvMwj7jAUL3-LoOiPf3KkrpcO_q8aL9ql3d6RVCzYcUQPh6A/s1920/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" width=\"320\"/>\n </div>\n <br/>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1", "\u0386\u03c3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf", "\u0395\u039c\u03a0"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_90.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
