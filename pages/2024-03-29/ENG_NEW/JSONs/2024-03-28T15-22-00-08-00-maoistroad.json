FIGHTING FOR OUR LAND.\n </h1>\n <p>\n  March 20, 2024\n </p>\n <p>\n  On March 7th, the Israeli military bombed the Palestinian General \nFederation of Trade Unions (PGFTU) headquarters in Gaza City. The PGFTU \nheadquarters housed crucial services, including a kindergarten for 380 \nchildren and a bakery serving many families. This was the third time \nthese headquarters faced such destruction, with previous attacks during \nIsrael\u2019s 2014 bombardment of Gaza.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition to the main building, three PGFTU branches in the \nAl-Rimal neighbourhood and Yarmouk Street were also destroyed. This \nassault targeted more than just buildings\u2014it struck at the very \nlivelihoods and rights of Palestinian workers. Yet, Palestinian workers \nremain unwavering, we will persevere in our fight for justice and \ndignity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As we prepare to mark Palestinian Land Day onMarch 30, and the \nanniversary of the 2018 Great March of Return, we continue to urge trade\n unions and workers worldwide to stand with us. We ask all people of \nconscience to end complicity with Israel\u2019s crimes, starting with an \nimmediate halt to the arms trade.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Land Day and the Great March of Return commemorations both hold \nprofound significance for our people, serving as reminders of our \nenduring struggle for justice and the realisation of our inalienable \nrights. In the face of Israel\u2019s genocide and attempts to ethnically \ncleanse Gaza, it is imperative to reaffirm the centrality of the right \nof return for allPalestinians. The majority of Palestinians, including \nthose in Gaza, are refugees whose right to return to their original \nhomes remains the core of the Palestinian struggle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As we prepare to observe these commemorations, we are confronted with\n the harrowing situation in Gaza. Israel\u2019s ceaseless bombardment and \ndeliberate tactics of starvation expose the genocidal nature of its \naggression, but also inflict the harshest consequences on workers. The \nforced evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza\u2019s northern region, alongside\n indiscriminate attacks on evacuees and vital infrastructure are a clear\n attempt at ethnic cleansing, a continuation of the Nakba of 1948.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We note the statements and actions from the global trade union \nmovement in response to the initial Palestinian trade unions call \ninOctober, and we salute all those who have stood with the people of \nPalestine. These gestures of solidarity, in both words and actions, are a\n continuation of the great tradition of trade union internationalism. \nHowever, more must be done: on Land Day we urge an escalation in actions\n to end the genocide. It is imperative that we target\n  <strong>\n   not only the sale and funding of arms to Israel\n  </strong>\n  , but also the\n  <strong>\n   transportation of these weapons and other key materials used by the Israeli military\n  </strong>\n  in enforcing its brutal and illegal siege.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We call on workers and trade unions worldwide to mobilise for Land Day 2024 by:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Refusing to participate in the production and transportation \nof arms destined to or from Israel. By disrupting the logistics of \nIsrael\u2019s military operations, we can impede its ability to carry out \nfurther violence against our people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Confronting government complicity in perpetuating Israel\u2019s \naggression. This includes challenging the issuance of licenses for arms \nsales, protesting at defence and foreign ministries. Governments must be\n held accountable for their role in facilitating Israel\u2019s genocide.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Escalating all effective trade union actions \u2013 passing \nmotions, taking action in your workplace, organising education sessions,\n and building networks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite the horror of Israel\u2019s genocide and its daily crimes against \nPalestinians, we cannot despair or divert our attention. Instead, to \nmark this historic day for the people of Palestine in our struggle for \nliberation, let us renew our commitment to stand united as workers \nagainst injustice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  .\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4976\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://infokomintern.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/fb_img_17114499310422651244028316736805.jpg?w=648\" srcset=\"https://infokomintern.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/fb_img_17114499310422651244028316736805.jpg?w=648\" width=\"400\"/>\n </p>\n castellano:\n <a href=\"https://www.workersinpalestine.org/files/llamado-de-las-y-los-trabajadores-palestinos\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n  https://www.workersinpalestine.org/files/llamado-de-las-y-los-trabajadores-palestinos\n </a>\n <p>\n  arab:\n  <a href=\"https://www.workersinpalestine.org/files/arabic-land-day-call\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   https://www.workersinpalestine.org/files/arabic-land-day-call\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  francais:\n  <a href=\"https://www.workersinpalestine.org/files/appel-des-travailleurs-palestiniens-a-loccasion-de-la-journee-de-la-terre\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   https://www.workersinpalestine.org/files/appel-des-travailleurs-palestiniens-a-loccasion-de-la-journee-de-la-terre\n  </a>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "PALESTINIAN WORKERS\u2019 CALL ON LAND DAY: FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOM.
