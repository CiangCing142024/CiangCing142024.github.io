In the difficult conditions of wars and open terrorism, he managed and left strong legacies for the advance of the case he persistently served. His contribution to the organizational and political upgrading of the KKE is unquestionable. He helped further the evolution of the KKE revolutionary conquests by writing his study of \"foreign capital in Greece\", a text that still remains today as content and form.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From his involvement in the rural mobilizations in Amaliada's birthplace, his action in Patras, in the first and second guerrillas to the trials of the \"wireless\", Belogiannis represented the integrity of the thousands of communists who gave their lives for freedom and independence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The event will take place at the Stone \"Instrust\" where there will be a documentary exhibition of his career and scenes will be screened by Nikos Jima's film \"The Man with the Carnation\".\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03b1", "\u039a.\u039a.\u0395.(\u03bc-\u03bb)", "\u039c\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2", "\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/72-30.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
