The new ND government has not closed eight months and has voted for a series of anti -populist, anti -labor, anti -political laws in the service of the capital. The anti -labor law Georgiadis, which further intensifies the Middle Ages, the new tax bill that puts a padlock on thousands of self -employed, the law on the establishment of private universities. At the same time, fascist politics, state terrorism and repression, is intensifying, any resistance of youth and workers are criminalized.\n </div>\n <div>\n  No popular rights are no longer recognized by its capital and governments that abolish, what the working class and the people have conquered through many years of bloody struggles.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This policy is also reflected in the issue of health.\u00a0 The people's right to free health care is directly attacked.\n </div>\n <div div=\"\">\n  <div>\n   This policy is experienced by the citizens of Lasithi, Crete, throughout the country. The resignations of non -replaced doctors, the shortages of medical and nursing staff resulting in postponements in hospital surgery and operations lead to depreciation and degradation and substantially closure. The whole situation concerns not only the hospitals of the Prefecture (Aga Nikolaou, Ierapetra, Sitia, Neapolis) and Rethymnon, and even Venizelio !!!, forming a black landscape in the right to care for the citizens of the area.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   The way out in our struggles for our right to health care\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   Equal - complete and free care for all without conditions\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n   Mass and permanent staff recruitment\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <span style=\"white-space: pre;\">\n   </span>\n   Permanent stable work for everyone.
