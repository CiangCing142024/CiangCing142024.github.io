This goes to \n legitimize the militarized repression implemented against \n protests within universities, places of knowledge that \n abdicate their critical role towards what is \n happening, and protecting students and students. From Naples to \n Bologna, from Pisa to Venice and Turin, in a space that by nature \n it should be the first to allow and encourage expression \n of opinions and critical readings of the reality that surrounds us, the \n Student protests had to face the manganelli like \n response to dissent, which instead sought a dialogue.\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  For example is what happened at the University \n Federico II of Naples when, following the protests for the\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n presence of the director of the newspaper \"La Repubblica\" Maurizio \n Molinari, as an accomplice of the massacre, the minister \n Lollobrigida agriculture has imaginatively argued that the \n disputes were comparable to the political climax that brought \n to the killing of Aldo Moro and defining them terrorist, with a \n Great effort of imagination. This immense alarmism paints \n a clear image: the image of a government that, paradoxically \n wearing the mask of the defender of democracy, he proves \n terrified by dissent, especially youthful and above all \n when concerning the genocide taking place in Palestine.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  On the basis of these fallacious pretexts, the minister \n Planted did not hesitate to process a shameful access plan \n \"Limited and controlled\" to the universities, which in fact would foresee \n as a standard the presence of law enforcement agencies to the entrances of the \n classrooms where conferences and appointments are held, with the explicit \n purpose of repressing any dispute. Given that the \n accusations of terrorism, which this government launches with a lightness \n disconcerting, they should remain in the pocket to those who make themselves accomplice \n of the genocide perpetrated by Israel, the pretext of these \n senseless comparisons that Lollobrigida Azzarda is clear, and Mal \n I dismantle yet another attempt to impose a turn of lives \n securitarian and detective that suffocates dissent, armoring one of the \n Rich in critical stimuli.\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  Universities, in this political panorama that \n more and more anguished assumes openly fascist connotations, \n lend the side to the progressive tightening of brutality \n police and repression of dissent.
