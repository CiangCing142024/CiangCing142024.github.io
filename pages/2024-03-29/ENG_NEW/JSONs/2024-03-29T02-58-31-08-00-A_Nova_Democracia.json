Residents denounce food insecurity, housing destruction and pollution in a preservation area.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the region is being built a condominium, Residencial Village by do Sol, and since then the population has reported a worsening of quality of life due to the losses generated by the work. The mangrove and streams, a tributary of the Patience River, are being contaminated, preventing residents from being able to take their livelihoods and food through seafood collection.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In an interview with the Tambor newspaper, Wilton Neves, resident of Cumbique, tells a little about the damage that the work caused, in two years. \u201cIt came to mess our mangrove. My mother's house fell, invaded by mud water of this construction. The boats are jammed with so much mud. Fishermen cannot fish. They respect nothing and no one, \u201dsaid the interviewee.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Being a fishing community, the extraction activity is the main source of income of the population. Residents are mobilized and seek justice so that the work is discontinued.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Often, large business groups interrupt the life of communities, with the endorsement of the state. Under the guise of bringing \u201cdevelopment and innovation\u201d to regions, they bring the destruction of the natural environment and the violation of peasants. Even in the face of serious complaint, Canopus Constru\u00e7\u00f5es follows unpunished and without giving answers on the cases.\n </p>\n</div>", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/ma-canopus-construcoes-e-responsavel-por-crime-ambiental-no-municipio-de-raposa/", "type": "article", "title": "MA: Canopus Constru\u00e7\u00f5es is responsible for environmental crime in the municipality of Raposa - the new democracy", "description": "Residents denounce food insecurity, housing destruction and pollution in a preservation area.", "modified time": "2024-03-28T15:58:34-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-28T15:58:34-03:00", "author": ["Enrico Di Gregorio"], "categories": ["Nacional"], "tags": ["Luta camponesa"], "sections": ["Nacional"], "link-section": "nacional", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
