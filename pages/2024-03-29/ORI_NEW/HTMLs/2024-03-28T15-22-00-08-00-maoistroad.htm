  PALESTINIAN WORKERS’ CALL ON LAND DAY: FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOM. FIGHTING FOR OUR LAND.
 </h1>
 <p>
  March 20, 2024
 </p>
 <p>
  On March 7th, the Israeli military bombed the Palestinian General 
Federation of Trade Unions (PGFTU) headquarters in Gaza City. The PGFTU 
headquarters housed crucial services, including a kindergarten for 380 
children and a bakery serving many families. This was the third time 
these headquarters faced such destruction, with previous attacks during 
Israel’s 2014 bombardment of Gaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the main building, three PGFTU branches in the 
Al-Rimal neighbourhood and Yarmouk Street were also destroyed. This 
assault targeted more than just buildings—it struck at the very 
livelihoods and rights of Palestinian workers. Yet, Palestinian workers 
remain unwavering, we will persevere in our fight for justice and 
dignity.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we prepare to mark Palestinian Land Day onMarch 30, and the 
anniversary of the 2018 Great March of Return, we continue to urge trade
 unions and workers worldwide to stand with us. We ask all people of 
conscience to end complicity with Israel’s crimes, starting with an 
immediate halt to the arms trade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Land Day and the Great March of Return commemorations both hold 
profound significance for our people, serving as reminders of our 
enduring struggle for justice and the realisation of our inalienable 
rights. In the face of Israel’s genocide and attempts to ethnically 
cleanse Gaza, it is imperative to reaffirm the centrality of the right 
of return for allPalestinians. The majority of Palestinians, including 
those in Gaza, are refugees whose right to return to their original 
homes remains the core of the Palestinian struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we prepare to observe these commemorations, we are confronted with
 the harrowing situation in Gaza. Israel’s ceaseless bombardment and 
deliberate tactics of starvation expose the genocidal nature of its 
aggression, but also inflict the harshest consequences on workers. The 
forced evacuation of Palestinians from Gaza’s northern region, alongside
 indiscriminate attacks on evacuees and vital infrastructure are a clear
 attempt at ethnic cleansing, a continuation of the Nakba of 1948.
 </p>
 <p>
  We note the statements and actions from the global trade union 
movement in response to the initial Palestinian trade unions call 
inOctober, and we salute all those who have stood with the people of 
Palestine. These gestures of solidarity, in both words and actions, are a
 continuation of the great tradition of trade union internationalism. 
However, more must be done: on Land Day we urge an escalation in actions
 to end the genocide. It is imperative that we target
  <strong>
   not only the sale and funding of arms to Israel
  </strong>
  , but also the
  <strong>
   transportation of these weapons and other key materials used by the Israeli military
  </strong>
  in enforcing its brutal and illegal siege.
 </p>
 <p>
  We call on workers and trade unions worldwide to mobilise for Land Day 2024 by:
 </p>
 <p>
  ●      Refusing to participate in the production and transportation 
of arms destined to or from Israel. By disrupting the logistics of 
Israel’s military operations, we can impede its ability to carry out 
further violence against our people.
 </p>
 <p>
  ●      Confronting government complicity in perpetuating Israel’s 
aggression. This includes challenging the issuance of licenses for arms 
sales, protesting at defence and foreign ministries. Governments must be
 held accountable for their role in facilitating Israel’s genocide.
 </p>
 <p>
  ●      Escalating all effective trade union actions – passing 
motions, taking action in your workplace, organising education sessions,
 and building networks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the horror of Israel’s genocide and its daily crimes against 
Palestinians, we cannot despair or divert our attention. Instead, to 
mark this historic day for the people of Palestine in our struggle for 
liberation, let us renew our commitment to stand united as workers 
against injustice.
