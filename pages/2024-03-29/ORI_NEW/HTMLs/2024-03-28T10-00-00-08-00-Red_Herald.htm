  According to the old State authorities the CPI(Maoist) is again carrying out activities in the state of Karnataka. On the 19

  </sup>
  of March the media
  <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/naxals-spotted-in-kodagu-forest-hassan-on-high-alert-2943890">
   reported
  </a>
  that the old State authorities had made an investigation into “suspicious movement” of a group of people at the Kodagu-Dakshina Kannada border and said they were Maoists, who had been appealing to the masses to support them. Later, on Saturday the 23

  <a href="https://menafn.com/1107988903/Karnataka-Naxals-Appear-In-Coorg-Ahead-Of-Lok-Sabha-Elections-2024">
   have expressed
  </a>
  their concerns for the development as the Lok Sabha (House of the People, lower house of the Indian parliament) elections are coming up, and they fear the election boycott campaign of the Maoists could gain hold in new areas. In the media it has also been highlighted that this area could provide strategically valuable routes to the neighboring regions for the guerrillas. A repressive operation of paramilitaries and police has been launched in the area.
