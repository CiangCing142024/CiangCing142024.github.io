  A group of Israeli elite soldiers of the Givati brigade refused to take part in military operations in the Gaza Strip, accusing the army of neglecting its physical and psychological well-being, according to the publication of the Haaretz portal on Wednesday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the Israeli army began the earthly invasion of Gaza at the end of October 2023, the Givati brigade, which includes elite fighters, has taken part in the most difficult bumps at the enclave and lost many of its leaders and members, forcing the leaders of the leaders army to “temporarily” from the battlefield.
 </p>
 <p>
  Palestinian resistance groups repeatedly defeated Givati and other elite forces in Gaza, expelling them to certain areas after annihilating and injured many of their soldiers.

  Terrified soldiers
 </h4>
 <p>
  During a conversation with commanders, the soldiers claimed that they have no psychological structure to return to the battlefield and expressed fear that returning would put their lives at risk.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newspaper reported that Army leaders have not yet decided to respond to the refusal of the soldiers to return to the foray.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thousands of Israeli soldiers have had confirmed deaths and injuries in the Gaza War so far.
 </p>
 <p>
  The estimate of Israeli military losses are much larger in media vehicles and leaked data from hospitals when compared to the official numbers declared by the Israeli army.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Ministry of Health of Gaza, 28,663 Palestinians were murdered and 68,395 injured in the genocidal foray into Gaza began on October 7.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, at least 7,000 people are not in these data, as they are presumed to be killed among the wreckage of their homes in the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
 <p>
  International and Palestinian organizations say most of the dead and injured are women and children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Israeli aggression also resulted in the forced eviction of nearly two million people throughout the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the outstanding in the overcrowded city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt - has become the largest exodus in Palestinian mass since the Nakba, in 1948.
