  The last recent feminicides are precisely of the last few days.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On February 14 there was the one in Cisterna di Latina, in which the mother of an ex -girlfriend of the murderer were killed. And the day before yesterday there was the killing of a 61 -year -old woman in Bolzano.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Since the beginning of this year there are already 8 feminicides, sometimes, as has happened in Cisterna di Latina, it is double femicide.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we want to focus a moment on this of Cisterna di Latina because there is an aspect that have highlighted few newspapers, but it is significant.
 </p>
 <div style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The latter femicide was committed by a marshal of finance, but it is not the only committed by the police, of those who have the easy gun, because always in this country - which is not a great country, it is a matter of A reality of just over 36,000 inhabitants - in previous years, coincidentally, there have been 2 more femicides: one in 2018 at the hands of an appointed carabinieri who, not only did he shoot his wife but also killed his two daughters, then yes suicidate. In 2014 another: in this case a prison police officer killed his partner.
  <br/>
  How come in the same country - not great - did these feminicides occur at the hands of the police or in any case committed by those who have the opportunity to have weapons?
 </div>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We immediately link this femicide to the decree that the Meloni government is preparing. It is said that the men of the police can always keep the gun with them, that is, in fact these men even at home, even in private situations, will always have the gun at hand. And clearly this will only feed the killings, the feminicides, by this type of men who evidently consider how "normal" react to situations of different choices from women, other than their will, shooting, killing.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As we have written other times, it is a war, a low intensity war against women, with femicides who are increasing, who are becoming almost daily, at least those who know each other, who arrive in the press, on television.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <b>
   These feminicides are made by new men, with certain patriarcalist conceptions, but above all with fascist conceptions, these are modern fascists because they are moved by hatred against women
  </b>
  who do not accept to be subordinated, who want to decide on their lives, who want to break bonds that become oppressive chains, and violent in some cases, who do not agree to be the one to "have to have their heads on the shoulders", as Meloni says, To be good women who mainly think about the family.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <b>
   And fascism, of which we now have an institutional expression in the government and in the representatives of this state, of these institutions, in the ministers that are part of this government, which produces a sort of modern patriarchy
  </b>
  Which is not old patriarchism, but is a new one, in a certain sense more social, more political, more ideological, more terrible, institutional, which therefore cannot be fought only with culture, with education, etc., but dev 'be fought with
  <b>
   The struggle to overthrow this modern fascist system.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is because, as a writer said, they are not "ancient men", they are
  <i>
   "Modern ancient men, frustrated by the freedom that women rightly want, who feel like the theft of their freedom, of their properties on women
  </i>
  ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <b>
   Today this war against women is going to intensify because modern fascism is the construction of the system, to normal, of everything that is reactionary, male chauvinist, rotten;
  </b>
  And towards which the small, ineffective, measures that the Meloni government boasts are truly an absolute hypocrisy, because, at the same time, the ministers, exponents of brothers of Italy, the government party, issue statements and make campaigns Ideological and political for which the centrality of the role of women must be at home, it must be in taking care of the children and therefore everything that goes against this becomes provocation, it becomes that you have fault if then, in the face of these life choices Different, your husband, your ex, kills you.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Fascist humus makes it normal to react to women. As is normal in the USA, but not only in the United States, that men, boys, frustrated to arms and kill at the mass level, so for men it seems almost "obvious" that the reaction to women must be violent.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <b>
   In the face of this, however, a response of women rises, a response of struggle.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On November 25, it was not obvious that there was the participation of half a million women and also of men, but above all in the vast majority of women, at the Rome event. It was an imposing event, it was also a different event from the others of the previous years, because it was full of anger, of determination. There were the signs that said "we are furious", "the witches are back".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today, it is also about March 8th, to raise, extend in every place, in every city, in every workplace - where, among other things, all another series of violence also take place: economic, living conditions , of discrimination, harassment towards women, workers - this struggle of women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is a question of giving continuity, of giving strength, but above all we think that it is necessary to direct the struggle of women more and more towards a revolution that is a clean place of men who hate women, governments, states that women hate.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Saying enough to feminicides means more struggle, more mass struggle than women in every place, more dangerous struggle
