 We want to take stock and 
 bring for example our work in the places of 
 work, in factories, between workers and workers, that 
 of the necessary battle, of the link between the support for 
 Palestinian resistance and the battle against the imperialist war, 
 that binds the interests - even immediate - of workers with respect 
 to the international situation.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This work 
 The factories are already taking place within a more activity 
 general to raise consciousness and counter -information in places 
 of work, using what is the tool of the 
 Counter -information.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After October 7th 
 We continually intervened, bringing the mobilizations and i 
 contents of the Palestinian struggle and the solidarity campaign e 
 of movements also in the jobs, we did ours 
 part to inform and make workers participate in this battle 
 which is also fundamental for
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 the defense of working conditions, 
 a defense in the perspective of an attack, with the awareness 
 that only the questioning of the entire system 
 capitalist/imperialist can also make sense of ours 
 everyday claims.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Countryside 
 also started internationally - and that we in Italy have 
 made their own by adhering to the two initiatives of 23 February and 24 
 February launched by the Palestinian organizations, in particular 
 by the young Palestinians of Italy - it is very important and gives us 
 An additional opportunity to make a specific campaign compared to 
 Those who are the links between the genocidal plan of Israel e 
 imperialism and the intervention and the enlargement of the war then, 
 with the direct sending of our troop imperialism in the Mar 
 Red and therefore the battle that binds the struggle of peoples, the 
 resistance to the factories of our imperialist countries, which is the 
 better support for the Palestinian people, their resistance and everyone 
 The martyrs who are resisting the genocide of 
 Israel.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start with it 
 explain that behind the inhumanity of this genocide, of this 
 Destruction campaign towards the Palestinian people, of annihilation 
 of a people, there is the imperialist system, there is the logic of 
 profit and therefore it is up to us, to us workers and communists, explain 
 what is behind this system that generates these genocides 
 in the silence of all powerful imperialist states, while 
 On the other hand, all peoples are lined up alongside the 
 resistance of the Palestinian people, who are increasingly an example - 
 As we have said several times in the interventions to the factories - the 
 Palestine is the example of the peoples who fight, the liberation of the 
 Palestine is the liberation of all the oppressed.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We have to go down 
 in the square with these objectives and link this solidarity to the people 
 Palestinian, to the fight against those who give us none every day 
 Guarantee: workers in factories are not guaranteeing the 
 I work, for students there is no future, it is a school 
 More and more full of war, full of pieces of shit like Crosetto. Also 
 On Israel and Palestine we see that the Meloni government is not a 
 government like the others, it is always a government of the masters but it is a 
 Government of fascists, where Crosetto is the direct exponent 
 of the military industry, and in other governments there is never this 
 state. So it is very similar to what is also going on in 
 Netanyahu government that is marching towards a regime, also firing 
 of the contrary voices there are in that country.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We have to 
 bring this campaign and this message that are very important 
 For the unity of the struggle of peoples, of the proletarians: that the proletarians 
 they do not have the home of the capital to defend but have only one 
 world to conquer. And for this reason it is very important to come into 
 field of workers, even if not easy because it is difficult in this atmosphere of 
 permanent campaign, disinformation and attack on dissent, of 
 criminalization, with the repression that also in these days is 
 made more feel.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Our intervention that has been done 
 In front of Rai, in Milan, summarizes this climate which is a 
 sign of weakness by the warfounded government, 
 fascist, of the Meloni who deludes himself that with the repression he can 
 stop the right solidarity and the struggle of peoples and proletarians.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The appeal of 
 23 and 24 binds the importance of solidarity with resistance 
 Palestinian and the fight against the imperialist war and in this 
 sense on the day of the 23rd is a day of strikes that for us wants 
 say assemblies, information, day of struggle organized by 
 basic unions to which the Slai Cobas for the union of 
 class joined. It is a very important day of struggle for 
 bring the right requests of the workers directly 
 Palestinian resistance that want a right peace, a peace with the 
 justice, who want to say enough to the imperialist wars, is enough 
 to the unjust wars, but who know very well that to get everything 
 This must be made a war, the war on the exploiters, the war 
 to Zionists, to the imperialists, the masters of the world, the war on 
 Italian government that is at war against the Palestinian people because 
 just in these days, not only through what are the 
 weapons industries, but also through the direct sending of the soldiers 
 In the Red Sea, he entered the war directly against the Palestinians 
 And therefore against all the proletarians.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This campaign e 
 This activity in the jobs, among the workers, is a lot 
 important because the best help to the Palestinian people is that 
 to hit our government and all its dirty interests that 
 are those of the masters of the multinationals, of the factories of 
 weapons, of Eni. Let's not forget that in front of Palestine there is a 
 Large interest of Eni for oil, for the gas, of a great deposit 
 of the Palestinians who want to be exploited by Israel and his 
 imperialist friends who are not by chance helping Israel and then 
 Shake, also in this case, the booty.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this it is one 
 The resistance that in Yemen is doing the 
 Yemenity people, defined not correctly as "Houthi rebels", 
 But this is a very important thing because it is an intervention 
 direct that affects the interests of the masters, of 
 imperialists and this is the other question that is very important in 
 These two days, to get to strikes, to 
 stops, to position sockets in the factories, which, we know 
 very well, which is a very long job, but it is 
 a necessary work to which this campaign offers the possibility of 
 give continuity.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The event 
 Milan national of 24 from Piazzale Loreto binds the question 
 internationalist to the question of the struggle here in Italy, because, 
 As we also said in other interventions, the resistance in 
 Palestine is the resistance that is also needed here in Italy.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How was it 
 said in the appeals of the Palestinian Associations compared to these 
 Two days what is necessary is to raise the level of the 
 solidarity that is what you need right now. Because like 
 increases this solidarity increases the repression of the police, 
 As in Vicenza, to the events in front of Rai. Now let's see 
 which increasingly increase these attempts to use the truncheon 
 To stop, but on the other hand it tells us that the state, governments, i 
 masters, they are afraid of the peoples who raise their heads, they are afraid 
 of the example that comes from 7 October and which comes from many other struggles 
 like that of the Communist Party of India, of the struggles of 
 National liberation, popular wars against fascism 
 Hindu in India and in many other countries. These struggles, these people's wars must join in a 
 Antimperialist, anti -capitalist front and the liberation struggle 
 of Palestine must find her way to an effective one 
 liberation through international link and solidarity e 
 internationalist with the organizations that direct these 
 Resistances.
