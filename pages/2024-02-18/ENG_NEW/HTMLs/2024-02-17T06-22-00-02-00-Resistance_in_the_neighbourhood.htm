 During an attempt to co -ordinate a common framework during the general
 <br/>
 Assembly by members of ARA and KNE (of any member of both of them
 <br/>
 Forces were not a member of FS PAPI) showed complete depreciation until the exhortations of leaving the racing moves from the debate. This reveals the attitude and perspective of the forces that swear in the name of "unity" and "unity". Public affairs
 <br/>
 Frames at the General Assembly, two banners of the club in demonstration and organizational confrontations on the road. This is the unity that they are proclaimed, and they exclude political forces from writing a common framework.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 On the crucial issue of the Reminder, the KNEAK Conditions concluded "no tooling of the remote control to undermine our struggle and our occupation" (which even this wording even denounces the remoteness). In the sealed framework uploaded by the NCAK the proposal appears. But it does not appear in the sealed
 <br/>
 Framework uploaded by KNE. This is part of the overall attitude of these forces that
 <br/>
 see clubs as a stamp and have nothing to seal differently
 <br/>
 texts and download different banners of the student club in mobilizations.
 <br/>
 The denial is also the refusal of counting the votes by the PCS and the
 <br/>
 ESAK and the decision, and there was a high possibility that there would be no quorum. THE
 <br/>
 The excuse was that the result is clear and that we should not get in "obstacle
 <br/>
 In the race. " However, it was the KNE itself who put it that the assembly can not make a decision
 <br/>
 no quorum for the remote examination while it can take for occupation without raising the issue
 <br/>
 For the remote examination! When we set that the votes should be counted
 <br/>
 Challenging answer that we are with government and DAP! These forces
 <br/>
 They perceive collective procedures as stamps of validation of their decisions,
 <br/>
 without respecting student clubs.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Quorum is not a 'bureaucratic' issue of compliance for formal reasons,
 <br/>
 But for politicians. In order to take a decision by a general meeting you must
 <br/>
 reflects and represents the student club. If we today accept such
 <br/>
 Practices, then DAP and PASP with similar practices and even less people will be able to
 <br/>
 decide for us without us. Would these same attitude have the same attitude if
 <br/>
 Did they feel that they were not gathering the necessary votes to vote for their context? These
 <br/>
 Practices give the DAP to come out to speak minorities who are squatting. THE
 <br/>
 Case in the reconstruction of the student movement and the massage of the matches that
 <br/>
 gives the student movement, it concerns the students themselves who must become subject to
 <br/>
 Fight, without waiting for the "elected saviors" to solve their problems.
 <br/>
 Just for this we cannot accept to make decisions for students without
 <br/>
 students and without clear results of the decisions made.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Student mobilizations so far are definitely promising and can win.
 <br/>
 In view of the vote we must escalate our struggles so as not to pass the
 <br/>
 Pierrakakis Bill.
