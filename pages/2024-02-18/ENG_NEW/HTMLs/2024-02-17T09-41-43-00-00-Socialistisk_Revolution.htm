  According to Police Inspector Claus Danø, police will use the so-called "knock-knock" method, which they should have good experience with in Aarhus and Copenhagen. This method is that when the police see young people being in the company of people who are allegedly criminals or are gang members, they will reach out to the parents of the young people and talk to them. The police will generally also increase their presence in public space.

  Police have declared that they are actively working to prevent young people from being involved in crime. But it is obvious that they will never be able to solve this problem.

Instead, you will surely see this new task force being abused to harass masses with the origin of oppressed nations further.
