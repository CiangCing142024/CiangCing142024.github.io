 <p>
  We have 
  Wait a few days before taking a floor in front of the resolution 
  on the Askatasuna issued by the Municipality of Turin. Let me say, the reactions 
  broken down to which we attended made us laugh under and above the 
  moustache.
 </p>
 <p>
  We seem to have understood that to collect signatures against askatasuna e 
 For legality, Augusta Montaruli will go, the one sentenced for 
 Pecurated for buying Swarovski bags and luxury dinners with 
 money from the region. Congratulations! Someone a little more awake than her in 
 Party made her understand that, to go and ask for around 
 Askatasuna, the town's right could end up in the air. But 
 We understand that for those who live in politics since he was 16, reality 
 Outside the buildings it may appear a little faded. It seems to us to have 
 understood that there are those who dream of a police station inside the social center. 
 See the level of rovate of the liver reached due to us from 
 those same police unions applauding the killers of 
 Federico Aldrovandi is yet another medal. We then saw four 
 pilgrims with banners against Aska in front of Palazzo di Città in 
 an oceanic manifestation that would not have blocked a not 
 scooter. Finally, we saw a prosecutor in the ball try to 
 intervene in extremis with yet another synchronized precautionary measures 
 with the wishes of the city right. Fleas on the back of one 
 reality that animates their nightmares for almost 40 years. Since the meaning of 
 ridiculous missing these court jesters, it's up to us to be serious and 
 Try to explain what we are and what this “exit represents for us 
 from above".
 </p>
 <p>
  We do not demand that it makes consent, we understand that many do not go 
 down, we understand that this is incomprehensible to the prosecutor but we start 
  From a fact: many young people have approached and continue 
  to approach the reality of the Askatasuna Social Center. Not for 
 obscure manipulations of a group of violent vicious, as they would like 
 Make the Quaesturini delusions believe, but because the askatasuna feels a 
 respond to a need that goes beyond the property of Corso Regina 
 47. The need for a common dream, the desire to build a power 
 collective far from the hypocrisy of institutional policy but capable 
  to weigh on the city. It is from this need that a reality was born that, 
 As we have seen in these days, it has grown to become 
 obsession of the right and bad awareness of a left that too much 
 he often abdicated the role of representing his part, that of 
 oppressed. In a world where resignation and individualism reigns we are 
 people with the ball to do politics. In a world to do politics 
 It means getting paid we understand that to do politics 
 you have to pay. Energy, time and also, sometimes, freedom. Why the 
 History of the peoples who fight gives us back the fact that legality does not 
 always coincides with social justice and that serves to fight to do 
 prevailing rights, even the fundamental ones, on the interests of 
 part.
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Since we committed the unforgivable sin of giving legs and 
 continuity to the protests in Val di Susa, the state has decided to do 
 pay a very high price to dozens of militants. In about ten years 
 The suspects were over 200, perhaps the highest number for a 
 political collective since the 1970s. This against a level of 
 all in all conflict extremely contained both with respect to history 
 of our country is compared to what we see elsewhere in Europe. But 
 On the other hand, there is little to complain: if there is a laughter it is increasingly difficult 
  swim free. Many, sometimes just teenagers, have served 
 Prison prison, many long house arrest. The processes yes 
  they are resolved for the most part in nothing done, convictions 
 "Bagatellari" or even acquittals. But this cares little, why 
 The intent has always been only to weaken the old and scare the 
  young. Many have continued, however, incredibly, to join 
  to a project that, without many menate, tries to put themselves at the service of the 
  social conflict. Police Headquarters therefore open a second front, 
 the one to try to disarticulate the link between askatasuna and the city, 
 With levels of infamy of primati guinness. If the bad model e 
 Violent does not work, let's try to pass them by Ras and Magnaccia. There 
 Digos comes to chase those who passed off crack in front of the school 
 Elementary of Vanchiglia to snatch a complaint against the boys 
 of the social center that would have dared to pull them a kick in the ass. 
 Traces a violent husband kicked out of a housing employment for 
 Ask him to identify the bad guys who would put him on the door. AND 
  Getting culminating up to the attempted operation "subversive association" 
 of 2022. The model was to be that of the employed kindergarten of via 
 Alessandria: associative crime, eviction and demolition of the building. 
 However, there is a hitch, "the subversive association" is not signed by 
 Gip and, to save part of the theorem, the Review Court pulls 
 Outside the hat the crime of "criminal association", the eviction 
 goes upstream. Therefore the third front opens, that of attrition 
 administrative. Interventions of the firefighters, seals, mezzucci, 
 attempt to pass a recreational space in which no one has ever 
 Taken a lira for disco. The goal is one, remove the ground 
 under the feet to a reality that does not bend and does not break, e 
 The evident sought -after epilogue.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this context it seemed fundamental to us to resume 
 The initiative. Politically relaunch to get out of the corner in which i 
 our opponents would have liked to keep us. We never had 
 problems with the fact that institutions recognize the value of how much 
 made from below (the after -school, the children's parties, the music, the 
 gym, cinema), indeed. CSA Murazzi himself was granted by the Municipality 
  back in 1989 after a series of occupations, evictions and 
 mobilizations. And from then on, it seems to us that everything can be attributed, 
 except that they have been indulgent with the Turin -left center, 
 from the employment of the DS headquarters to protest against the arrest of 
 Ocalan back in 1999. Following, the harsh disputes against the 
 left of war that bombed Belgrade and the raid in the center 
 social in mode that anticipated what happened to the diaz of 
 Genoa. The story is long ... and it comes until Friday's operation 
 last with about ten new restrictions and prohibitions of residence for 
 Very young companions and companions.
 </p>
 <p>
  The important thing for us is how we get to what it can be, a 
 Second of the contexts, a useful, useless or deleterious passage. The action 
 politics is shaped upside down by the need to be recognized 
 From the institutions? Worse, you get recognized to try to get 
 A place in the sun for some heads or capes? Or it is built 
 patiently a rooting until a busy space becomes a 
  Reference point essential for the city? Having said that, for 
 We the social center has always been a means and not an end. If for 
 some reason, strictly politicalist, this path in the future 
 should be raised, the fact that it is already evident for one does not change 
  Great slice of Turin. From the children of the kindergarten in via Balbo who come to 
  celebrate the birthday with their friends inside Aska, up to 
 boys who came from the Turin province to dance on the notes of the 
 Tecno nobody waited for a piece of paper to find out that askatasuna is 
  Already a common good of the city.
 </p>
 <p>
  We specify a couple of points, to dissipate any doubt and remove 
 A few crickets for the head. We are more than available to invest the 
 our energies to improve the safety of the building and guarantee a 
  greater usability and facilitate access. Because we are convinced, 
 together with many others, that the center has now become a common heritage 
  that goes beyond the political collective that has taken care of it until today, 
 ensuring the performance of many activities for the city. Our 
 commitment in this sense, however, does not mean in any way to abdicate bonds 
  that we built with the Vanchiglia neighborhood and our commitment 
 politician in the area. We were there for this neighborhood when it was 
 a desert of services. We were there when the administrations have 
 started a process to transform it into the "table", releasing 
 licenses to the right and missing. We were there when we wanted 
 militarize the neighborhood to repress a nightlife moved there 
 of strength from the wicked choices made at Palazzo di Città. Here we are 
 states to give outdoor activities to the children of the neighborhood during 
  the pandemic when the families were left alone by 
 institutions. We understand that for politicians who think with deadlines 
 electoral at 4 or 5 years are secondary dynamics, but for us who 
 We shaped Vanchiglia's life and were shaped by it, 
 They are central things. As far as we are concerned, we are at the beginning of a 
 path, everything can still happen: it is an unexplored ground for us but 
  We practice it with the same determination and partiality with which from 
 decades are a living part of the struggles in the area, in the city, in the valley and 
  Wherever it will be necessary to mobilize.
 </p>
 <p>
  So it is, it seems to us
 </p>
 <p>
  ______________________________________________________________________________
 </p>
 <p>
  Turin repression laboratory is a recurring frame and a reality 
  that those who protest in the city live on the skin. The choice of askatasuna e 
 of the Municipality to undertake a path of dialogue and experiment 
 New, such as the common good and co-design, breaks it.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leaving 
  glimpse another possible city. And specific: city, because the 
 deliberates on the common good is to be read not as a resolution of a 
 public order problem, but as an idea of a living territory, where the 
  conflict is not neutralized and the participation enhanced. A 
 Another model of democracy. Utopia? The sterilization of a 
 Radical alternative experience?
 </p>
 <p>
  Mind you. It won't be a 
 Easy route, it stands on a thin balance of balance. On the side 
 of askatasuna, there is the maintenance of a strong radicality in the context 
 of a frame shared with the Municipality; by the institutions, there is 
 the comparison with a political project and a protest that hit e 
 restless. But this is the complexity of a conflicting democracy, it is 
 the indicator of his good state of health. It is a signal 
 countercurrent compared to the image of a democracy that does not tolerate 
 the strikes, which represses eco-activism, which expels thought 
 divergent, as well as an atrophilic democracy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's a 
 "antagonist" experimentation, to resume provocatively 
 a label used in a disqualifying and generalizing sense, 
 Compared to the prevailing model: repressive, approval and passiveizing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Between 
  The most evident connotations of Turin "repression laboratory", yes 
 reports judicial activism attentive to all possible violations 
  law, civil, criminal, administrative, experienced on 
 belonging to the No Tav movement and applied to those who act the conflict 
 social. It affects Reading on the Prosecutor's website that the pool of 
 magistrates who habitually deals with the crimes inherent in the protest is 
 colored under the item «terrorism and subversion of the order 
 democratic". Dissent and protest, far from being ascribable 
 to terrorism (the attempts in this regard were cassated by the same 
 judiciary) are not subversive of the democratic order but element 
 essential of democracy. The concept of a presumed order is 
  Far from a horizon that implies pluralism and discussion.
 </p>
 <p>
  Certain, 
  The fulfillment of crimes must be pursued, but the criminal liability is 
 staff. Reasonableness and proportionality must be the parameter 
 To determine incriminating cases, precautionary measures and penalties, 
 How, even more so, the prevention measures adopted by the Quaestor, 
  Fascist retailed, of a lot (and more than) dubious legitimacy 
 constitutional. And then there is the violent behavior of the forces 
 of the order in protests. I think about May 1st, where the will to 
 prevent entry into the square at the social broken produces clashes 
 now "classics" (only in 2023 avoid, thanks to an intense dialogue 
 quote), to manganelli on anti -fascist students at university, 
 But the discussion can extend to the evictions of employed buildings or to the 
 Resistance to evictions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turin is a laboratory, but the trend is 
  Global: repressing, dissuading, intimidating the protest. It is a part of the 
  world that in the face of unsustainable inequalities, to the effects of a 
  increasingly violent competitiveness, it is armored.
 </p>
 <p>
  Turin that 
 look beyond the stigmatization of social centers as a lair of 
 illegality and recognizes value to the autorganization of social activities e 
  cultural, to participation from below, indicates another path 
 possible, that - incidentally - it is in the sign of the Constitution. And the 
 attempt to grasp the potential of a category, the "good 
 common », as a way to rethink the public good as" of citizens ", 
 without anesthetizing the divergence, even radical, which ensures the 
 plural dynamism, vitality, the possibility of transformation, of the 
  democracy.
 </p>
 <p>
  It will be up to the political forces in the field to ensure that this 
  is a different way to maintain "the strength of total criticism" 
 (Pasolini) without slipping into a "comfortable, smooth, reasonable, reasonable 
 Democratic non-libertà "(Marcuse).
 </p>
 <p>
  It is a small step, the 
 deliberates and not eviction, which refers to the great clash on the way 
 understand democracy: democracy as a control tool e 
 power management or democracy against power, in the sign of one 
 effective social and political emancipation?
