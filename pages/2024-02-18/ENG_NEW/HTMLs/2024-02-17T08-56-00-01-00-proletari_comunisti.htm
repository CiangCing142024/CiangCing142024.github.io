   Against the war and the mission of the Meloni government in Red Sea
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   THE 
  governments of the West have undertaken a drift more and more 
 Warning through: the Meloni government proceeds. In front of the Prefecture of 
 Turin we want to clearly indicate the responsibilities of the wars in 
 this government and in those preceding it.

   Against the genocide that the Israeli regime is committing in Palestine
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   There 
  solidarity with the Palestinian population is not enough, the city of Turin - 
  Also by virtue of the twinning with Gaza - he must give an answer 
 concrete and cut the memorandum of understanding between Iren and Mekorot (company 
  National Water of Israel).

 </h3>
 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   With 
  the increase in the involvement of our country in the current conflicts, 
 We witness the narrowing of any space of political accessibility: 
 Piazze denied for sit-in, violence

  police that breaks down on 
 students, anti -fascist teachers, migrants, workers or activists of 
 environmental movements. During the day of remembrance the government 
 Meloni has instrumentally prohibited the demonstrations in favor of the people 
  Palestinian, while those who went down to Piazza shouted that "never again!" 
 It means "never for anyone again!". The management of public order is 
 purely repressive, while - we saw it well in our city and 
  in the Val di Susa- the immoderate use of the precautionary measures and the sheets of 
 via goes to hit those who try to organize themselves and to assert their own 
 voice.

   Against the customs clearance of neo -fascist groups
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   THE 
  fascists are welcomed by the institutions of our country, starting 
 from universities, passing through schools and squares as adapto 
 Laurentia. Fascist propaganda against migrants a 
 protection of the borders of Italy and the European Union. As 
 anti -fascist we intend to be the embankment that opposes what the 
 History and resistance of peoples has already condemned and that today tries 
 again to regain political legitimacy.

   Against the internal war that increasingly hits the popular strata and criminalize migrants
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   The other one 
  face of war is the economy that downloads the 
 Costs of weapons and ammunition. The end of the market protected for light and gas, 
 the increase in prices, hunger wages, the absence of adequate welfare 
  It is accessible to everyone, the dismantling of citizenship income 
 are elements that fit into a climate of war to the poor now 
 become unacceptable.

 </h3>
 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   Always 
  The more our schools and universities become accomplices of the war. 
 War -speaking propaganda arrives in our classrooms thanks to 
 "Lessons" of the police and army. We say â€œmoney 
 to school and not to war ".

 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   The 
  Precepts of Minister Salvini are the last piece in order 
 chronological of a process aimed at dismantling rights at work, 
 affecting workers and conflicting unions. The Minister's line not 
 can pass!

 <p align="justify">
  <span data-darkreader-inline-color="">
   In the 
  election campaign that is opening many forces will declare themselves 
 fakely pacifist to ride the moods of a tired people of the 
 war. We will not accept any type of exploitation from whom in 
 Parliament voted and continues to vote for the increase in expenses 
 military.
