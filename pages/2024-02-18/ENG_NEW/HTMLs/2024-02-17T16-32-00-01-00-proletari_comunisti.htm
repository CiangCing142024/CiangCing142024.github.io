    <b>
     Appeal of the Eastern Office of the IC against imperialism and Zionism in Palestine
    </b>
    <b>
     (February 1925)
    </b>
   </h2>
   <p>
    The English imperialists and Zionist colonizers have again 
 The revolutionary avant -garde of the workers and peasants of the 
 Palestine.
   </p>
   <p>
    Dictatorial master of Egypt and Sudan, English imperialism 
 He wants to eradicate the Palestinian revolutionary and national movement. For 
  maintain "order" and tranquility in the Suez region, 
 England has started a furious repression campaign in 
 Palestine. The local bourgeoisie and the Zionist settlers carry out for her i 
 lower services.
   </p>
   <p>
    Remembling Zionism, English imperialism tries to break the 
 National emancipation of the Arabs. The Israelite bourgeoisie 
 Zionist gets, in reward for his good and loyal services, the 
 privilege of "dominant nation", while the population of Palestine 
  It includes only 13% of Jews. Using this privilege, 
 protected by machine guns and English planes, the organization 
 Zionist strives to remove the land from the Arab farmers. Ally e 
 accomplice of
    <span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <a name="more">
   </a>
   oppressors, the rich Arab feudal aristocracy - the 
 "Effendi" - willingly sells its lands to Jewish capitalists, without 
 take care of the fate of the Arab farmers who cultivate from 
 Dozens of these properties.
   <p>
   </p>
   <span id="more-26656">
   </span>
   <p>
    Every day, from the beginning of the Zionist colonization, of 
 Arabic growers are driven out of their lands. They are painful 
 Conflicts between Jewish settlers and small Arab farmers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each piece of land purchased by Zionist colonizers is taken to 
 price of the ruin of hundreds of Arab families. The English government 
 knows well how to exploit the national antagonism that arises from these 
 abuse. Exciting the Arabs against the Jews and the Jews against the 
 Arabs, English imperialism then presents itself in the part of referee, of 
  "Protector of peaceful populations". One way like any other for 
 justify its domination.
   </p>
   <p>
    The coalition of English imperialism, Jewish Zionism and of 
  Arabic feudalism to exploit the proletariat and the peasants in common 
 In Palestine, he found a devoted auxiliary in the Socialist Party 
 Achduct Kavoda of Palestine, section of the second international. This 
  "Socialist party" encourages the ignominious task that the settlers 
 Zionists call the "holy conquest of the earth", of the land of 
 Arab farmers. The Jewish workers, sadly unconscious, who follow 
 Achdu Kavoda kill each other with the
    <i>
     fellah
    </i>
    Arabs; The Zionists and the effendes are enriched.
   </p>
   <p>
    The ruthless expropriation of
    <i>
     fellah
    </i>
    ruined before 
 be brutally driven out of their outbreaks, misery, penalty and the 
 hunger for the Jewish and Arabs workers, cynically exploited by the bourgeoisie 
 Jewish and from the Arab nobility, they give birth to deaf riots among the 
 Palestine workers.
   </p>
   <p>
    The events of Afula [a town in northern Palestine - n.], Where 
 The blood of the Arab farmers and the Jewish colonists is last in one 
 battle for the earth, they proposed on the agenda the 
 Malopte of the Anglo-subjerable colonizers.
   </p>
   <p>
    Palestine Communist Party condemns hypocrisy and infamy 
 of the British oppressors and their Zionist vassals. The party 
 Communist of Palestine condemns the miserable "socialists" of thechdu 
 Kavoda and the "yellow" managers of the Histadrut union.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Communist Party wants the organization of workers 
 Palestinians, Arabs and Jews, without distinction of nationality, and the 
 establishment of union federations united on a struggle platform 
 class. Palestine Communists resist the formation of a 
 privileged Zionist caste, susceptible to come one day 
 thrown against the workers and defenseless Arab farmers.
    <span>
    </span>
   </p>
   <p>
    So all the reactionary forces of the country, from the English police to the socialists, declared war on our party.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bands of the Zionist fascism are seen to attack and massacre the 
 Revolutionary workers. The workers' circles are closed. The arrests yes 
 multiply.
   </p>
   <p>
    Workers' companions! Require the liberation of the arrested revolutionaries! 
 Demand the liberation of all political prisoners and all 
 Arab nationalists fighting against the Anglo-Sionist oppression!
   </p>
   <p>
    I lower the white terror!
   </p>
   <p>
    Long live the Communist Party of Palestine!
   </p>
   <p>
    Long live the fraternal and revolutionary union of the exploited Arab and Jews!
   </p>
