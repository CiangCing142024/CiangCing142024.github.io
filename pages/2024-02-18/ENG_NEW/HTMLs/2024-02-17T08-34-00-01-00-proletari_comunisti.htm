   We have returned these days from a short journey - but beautiful and 
 exciting - that we can define a journey of Marx and 
 In the footsteps of Marx's life and history, at least for that phase 
 in which he lived in the city of London.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   Was a 
 Journey with which on the one hand we wanted to honor Marx's memory 
 and that at the same time we considered a real 
 political initiative through which, retracing some places 
 significant of Marx's life, we reflected on what in 
 These years have studied through the training cycles 
 proletarian and revolutionary, in particular on specific texts of 
 Marx, such as the manifesto or the beginning of the capital.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   So a journey 
 which also fits into that concept that we call "guide 
 for revolutionary action ".
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   A stage 
 main of this trip, which however lasted a few days, is 
 He was at the Highgate cemetery, where Marx is buried.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   We arrived at 
 Small village of Highgate, a classically English village, 
 Very picturesque. A cute episode was the fact that in 
 Asking information to get to the cemetery smiled at us saying: 
 "But are you going to Marx's tomb?" In reality apart from the 
 maps we could have had, it was not difficult to reach this 
 place because there was like a sort of pilgrimage of people who 
 they went to the cemetery - and then towards the tomb of Marx - e 
 This has facilitated the path
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   In a classic 
 English day in gray sky, with a fairly temperature 
 fresh, we arrived at the cemetery, an English cemetery, with 
 scattered tombs, with quite different tombstones, without an apparent 
 scheme.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   The part where yes 
 Find Marx's tomb is faced with the biggest one in the 
 cemetery, also considered
   <span>

  </i>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 <i>
  the main one, where different are buried 
 Historical characters, writers, artists.
 </i>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   Taking the 
 country road that leads to the tomb, after a few minutes, to say 
 the truth, we immediately started to experience a certain emotion in 
 see the large marble head of Marx from afar from afar that dominates 
 The tomb, however surrounded by people. Approaching the emotion is 
 increased because it is true that we have seen it many times on books, 
 On the internet, in the photos, but seeing the plaque in presence is truly 
 A whole other thing.

  <br/>
  We stopped with other people. For a few minutes we have 
 observed the tomb from all sides, without saying anything, reading the 
 Registration with the names of the buried personalities: of course Karl 
 Marx, then his wife Jenny von Westphalen, the faithful Helene Demuth, the 
 daughter Eleanor.
 </i>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   We then have 
 heard that something more than a dutiful visit we should have 
 do, and so we pulled out the flags we had brought 
 Just to honor Marx's memory. And we took pictures, 
 one with the flag of our political organization and the other 
 as companions of the MFPR. Which was appreciated by some 
 passers -by who smiled at us and also gave us notes of 
 assent.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i style="text-align: center;">
   <i style="text-align: left;">
    And then, since we had brought some texts by Marx, in particular the manifesto of the Communist Party written together with Engels, and the international worker, we made a sort of celebration, in the sense that we have read some specific passages of these two texts in front of the plaque aloud.

   The choice of 
 These passages wanted to try to bring - with so much humility 
 Of course - what is the true spirit of all written work 
 and made by Marx and his inseparable, an exceptional companion of 
 fight, Engels, but above all to remember ourselves, that is 
 to put ourselves today, what are the purposes and what it takes today 
 to the communists and the working class, the class of the proletariat for 
 affirm them.

 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

   After that 
 We decided to intone the international. We started a 
 Singing it slowly also in the sense of respect for the place, but in reality, 
 As we spontaneously sang the voice has increased. So 
 Then we sung it with a much higher voice. This created a nice 
 moment for a shed of people around us, 
 almost a circle, with some who started singing together with 
 we, others who have raised the fist, others who smiled at us and 
 they made hints of consent. At the end, some of these people do 
 they wanted to present, in particular a group of Indians that there 
 They greeted with a lot of heat, holding their hand. There were also 
 of young girls very happy and showed up like 
 militants of the Communist Party of Marxist India and wanted 
 Also take a photo with us next to the plaque. So two 
 Chinese young people, another person who wanted to tell us that it was a 
 Brazilian companion. So also two young British.

   It was a nice 
 moment, both international and internationalist and this was 
 also a great emotion, which is a bit what Marx said 
 in all his texts: a proletariat, a working class that does not have 
 homeland but which is united by what the struggle must be 
 revolutionary to overthrow the dominant bourgeois and build a 
 Truly different society.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   This moment is 
 very beautiful state, with all these companions we were together 
 there, in front of the plaque. We do not hide that when we are there 
 went we were really quite excited and with tears at 
 eyes, on the one hand of joy, on the other of respect, of honor, but 
 Even a little sadness of having to go away from that place.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   In the days 
 subsequent we tried to pay homage to Max by visiting 
 other places in his life, particularly in the Soho district, 
 One of the homes where Marx lived for several years, a neighborhood 
 where there was also the library where Marx went to study and a 
 Read and then, much further on, the street where there is Engels' house.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <i>
   So a journey 
 very beautiful, an exciting journey, a journey full of many things, 
 a political journey, a journey also ideological, which helped us e 
 It helps us to affirm what is the ideology of the proletariat and there 
 encourages to move forward on the necessary revolutionary journey 
 Today to the whole class.
