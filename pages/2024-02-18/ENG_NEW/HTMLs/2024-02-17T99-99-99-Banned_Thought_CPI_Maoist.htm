The CC, CPI (Maoist) conveys its <br>hearty revolutionary greetings to all the well -wishers, friends and supporters of In dian Revolution <br>abroad who rendered their great contribution in propagating the Indian State‟s encirclement and <br>annihilate military campaigns against the Indian Revolution and help advance it with the utmost <br>steadfastness, revolutionary zeal and spirit.  <br>Our Party is  retaliating the „Reactionary Surajkund Strategic Offensive Plan‟ since last one <br>year with great sacrifices and contributions of Indian toiling masses and well -wishers, friends, <br>supporters of Indian People‟s Democratic Revolution and gaining new achievements. It is <br>advancing the New Democratic Revolution in semi -colonial, semi -feudal India in the path of <br>Protracted People‟s War with the aim of establishing Socialism -Communism all over the world.  <br>This is a brief report of the important aspects our Party‟s efforts in the Ideological -Political, <br>Military and United Front including Cultural front of CPI (Maoist) during the past one year for <br>friends and comrades of Indian Revolution abroad.  <br>Firstly we pay humble revolutionary homage to all the martyrs an d heroes who  shed their <br>blood for the cause of Indian Revolution. Our party met with a great loss of a member of the Polit <br>Bureau of the Central Committee Comrade Katakam Sudarshan apart from another 78 comrades. <br>Nearly 20 of the martyrs are woman comrades . The entire Party, PLGA red warriors, United Fronts <br>and revolutionary masses conveys its red salute to those brave hearts who sacrificed their lives <br>from the liberation of the masses from the shackles of semi -colonialism and semi -feudalism. We <br>pledge to t ake forth their ideals.  <br>We hail the great revolutionary determination of our comrades, members of the CC <br>Comrades Jaspal, Mohit, Janardhan (PBM) and Mangtu and hundreds of activists of the Party, <br>PLGA, RPC and RMOs who are in the dungeons of Indian State a nd reiterate that we would take <br>forth the efforts for their unconditional release.  <br>International situation  <br>The year 2023 was one more year of the intensification of Imperialist crisis and inter-<br>Imperialist wars on oppressed nations and oppressed people in a bid to redivide the world for loot <br>of land, natural resources and labour power . The Zionist Israeli state highly intensified  its bloody <br>war on Palestine making  genocide with the backing of US Imperialism together  with its western <br>imperialist alliances. N evertheless it could not defile the aspirations of the heroic Palestinians with <br>the great solidarity of world people.  <br>The last 22 months of uninterrupted US -Russia bloody proxy war in Ukraine has entered the <br>year 2024 with the cost of hundreds of people‟s lives. 2023 was the year of strikes against the loot <br><br><br>and exploitation of capitalist system and its war mongering. US declared it year of Strikes. In the <br>semi colonial semi feudal countries India, Philippines, Turkey, Peru, Afghanistan and Brazil where <br>New Democratic Revolution with socialist perspective is marching forward under the banner of <br>Marxism -Leninism -Maoism. The revolutionary movement went through  gruesome repression by <br>the reactionary governments with the support of Imperialism, mainly US Imperial ism. <br>In the background of the intensification of the general crisis of capitalism there are <br>considerable changes in world politics. US hegemony over the world has suffered a setback and it <br>is no longer a super power in t he multipolar world. However, US continues to be the Number One <br>enemy of the people of the world. Global capitalist system is in a state of generalized and <br>protracted stagnation and decline. Presently, intense mass unemployment, homelessness, <br>inflation, ra cism and fascism characterize the Imperialist countries. Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, <br>Nanotech, Biotech technologies are leading to retrenchment of lakh of toilers, employees and <br>technicians and to employment less growth in developed and developing c ountries.  <br>There is collusion and contention between the Imperialist powers but contention is the main <br>and primary. Trade wars between Imperialist powers reached a new height especially in semi -<br>conductor commodities that is popularly known as „chip war‟ bet ween US and China.  The US is <br>steadily increasing its military presence in Asia.  It is handing over large numbers of deadly <br>weapons to Philippines and Taiwan in opposition to China. China is utilizing the G -77 alliance of <br>the most backward countries for i ts interests of world hegemony. US has now based Nuclear -<br>capable B -52s in Darwin (Australia) and in Guam in order to target China and maintain its <br>hegemony over the Pacific Ocean. The situation is increasing the danger of World War III.  <br>We have been witnes sing a spate of anti -imperialist struggles in the backward countries and <br>a spate of working class struggles in capitalist -imperialist countries all over the world. The <br>sharpening fundamental contradictions at the international level are – 1. The contradict ion between <br>imperialism and oppressed nationalities and people 2. The contradiction between bourgeoisie and <br>proletariat in capitalist, imperialist countries 3. The contradictions among imperialist countries and <br>among monopoly capitalist groups. The contrad iction between imperialism and oppressed <br>nationalities and people is the main contradiction. These developments show that in 2024, the <br>situation would be more favourable for revolution.  <br>Domestic Situation  <br>India is deeply impacted by the intensification of contradictions between Imperialist powers <br>and other contradictions at the international arena.  In this situation the major contradictions of <br>India are also intensifying. US Imperialism utilized G -20 and e specially India‟s Presidentship to <br>further its interests. Lakh of crore were spent for the G -20 meeting at the cost of decline in the <br>economy of the country.  During his tenure, Modi is playing the role of a salesman in inviting <br>Finance Capital from MNCs i nto the country.  <br>India‟s accession to the US -led Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) is bound to create a <br>conducive environment for establishment of Special Export Zones of raw materials in a large scale <br>to G-7 countries. Just after few days of this deal, Indian government under BJP rule has amended <br>Environmental laws and Minerals Acts to facilitate the loot and plunder. Indian ruling classes are <br>lackeys in the hands of the Imperialist countries. Currently, India is one of the largest importers of <br>arms and weapons in the world and is also bound to increase its arms exports to Asian and African <br>countries by 5 billion dollars annually by 2025 with the help of US. It is a fact that most of this goes <br>to the MNCs.  <br>In the name of ease of doing business, the fascis t BJP government is making amendments <br>to several laws and abolishing the earlier laws, few of which were achieved through people‟s <br>struggles in the interests of domestic and foreign corporate companies. Corporatization and <br>Militarization is the trend in th e last one year of Modi‟s rule. The government took a drive for hyper <br>privatization of national resources and productive forces to provide  excessive  profits to Comprador <br>capitalist class and Imperialist powers. India is witnessing an unprecedented liveliho od crisis in its <br>history.  <br><br><br>The central government repeatedly states that India is going to become the third largest <br>economy in the world at 5 trillion dollars. But its announcement to provide 5 kgs. of rice per month <br>to 80 crore people reveals the reality o f the rising inequality in its rule. The growth being boasted <br>by Modi is only corporate and jobless growth, the three major sectors of the economy i.e. <br>Agriculture, Industry and Service being corporatized. The growth without improvement in the living <br>stand ards of the toiling classes is nothing but sham. While speaking of corruption free India, Modi <br>is in fact helping the Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeoisie such as Adani and Ambani to increase <br>their wealth. Adani was given a clasped hand to overcome the effec t of Hindenburg report on his <br>empire of wealth.  <br>Agricultural sector on which 60 percent of the Indian population remain dependent is in a <br>dire situation. Cost of production in agriculture has skyrocketed by 20 percent in the past one year. <br>The income of sm all and medium farmers has a miniscule increase of 2 percent. Real Wages of <br>the agricultural labourer that comprises 15 crore labour force further declined. According to new <br>wage  codes the minimum wages of workers is fixed at Rs. 178 per day that is an all -time low. <br>Unemployment among the educated youth is at all -time high.  <br>India is moving towards a fascist state at a rapid pace under the regime of Brahmanic <br>Hindutva fascism since the last 10 years. There is an unprecedented rise in exploitation and <br>oppress ion on the proletariat, semi -proletariat and the peasantry. The struggles of workers, <br>farmers and students are being  suppressed in fascist manner . There are increasing attacks and <br>military suppression on the struggle for national liberation of the people of Kashmir. The Supreme <br>Court of India passed judgment in favour of annulment of Article 370 A and asserted the <br>nullification of the nominal status of a special state to Kashmir. Religious thinking and religious <br>frenzy are introduced into politics  to sprea d communal hatred in the people.  <br>Modi‟s rule turned absolutely bureaucratic involving violence and deception together and<br>continuously. This turned to be daily gimmicks of the government. Attacks on Muslims, Christians, <br>Dalit, tribal, women, students, you th and all other oppressed people and sections has surmounted <br>and they are being consigned to second -class citizen in their own mother land. The criminal <br>elements in the BJP are encouraged to unleash all kinds of inhuman, cruel deeds on the people of <br>the c ountry.  <br>Nearly half of the MPs of BJP are involved in criminal cases related to women, one of them <br>being the infamous President of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). The world witnessed how the <br>police manhandled the woman wrestlers who achieved great fam e to the country, on their way to <br>the new Parliament building on the day when Modi was involved in its inauguration in the outdated <br>mode of Hindutva rituals. In a series of developments, three wrestlers expressed their strong <br>dissent to the government. The  atrocities committed on the Kuki -Zoma tribal people of the North <br>Eastern state of Manipur is another clear and recent example. Bulldozer has become the symbol of <br>nationalism under the fascist BJP rule and especially in states of double -engine government <br>(states under BJP rule). Unable to cope up with the situation there is a rise in suicides in these <br>sections.  <br>Crore of rupees are spent on building Hindu temples, mainly Ram mandir instead on <br>education, health and other such basic needs of the people of the country. The aim of these <br>activities is to instigate religious fundamentalism in various forms in a bid to  divide the people on <br>religious lines . It is meant to take them back to the medieval times and shed them of their scientific <br>and secular ideas as true  citizens of the country. The BJP government brought several draconian <br>laws like new three criminal laws and Data Protection bill to curb the dissent and the revolutionary, <br>democratic voices of the country.  <br>The BJP government wants all its ill deeds go unq uestioned and continue its oppressive <br>governance. The suspension of 146 Parliament Members of the opposition parties in the recent <br>session  of Parliament  is a clear example of Modi government‟s autocracy. The policies of BJP <br>reveal that it does not respect even the nominal federal, democratic aspects of bourgeois <br>democracy. However, the „INDIA‟ alliance is no exception. Whichever the party is, the ruling <br>classes of India possess Brahmanic Hindutva ideology. In this situation, workers, students, youth <br>and wom en are taking up militant struggles to live a normal life.  <br><br><br>In this international and domestic situation, the fundamental contradictions in the country <br>namely - 1. The contradiction between imperialism and the Indian people; 2. The contradiction <br>between feu dalism and the broad masses; 3. The contradiction between capital and labour; 4. The <br>internal contradictions among the ruling classes – are further intensifying creating favourable <br>conditions for revolution.  <br>The reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive pl an <br>The BJP works under the dictates of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) in order to <br>take forth its agenda of Brahmanic Hindutva, the establishment of a Hindu state in the country. <br>Putting together all the ongoing repressive measures, it reviewed in 2 023 December the <br>reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive plan that it brought forth in the end of October 2022. The <br>Prime Minister personally attended the meeting that was stated to have discussed about Left -Wing <br>Extremism (LWE) as they call it, cyber -crime and terrorism.  <br>The main objective of the offensive plan is to eliminate the Party, PLGA and the organs of <br>people‟s organisation, Revolutionary People‟s Committees and the entire revolutionary movement. <br>The state apparatus of Central and State governments was made more im petuous “by deploying <br>police, Para -military, Commando, Military and Airforce in a big scale in the areas of revolutionary <br>movement, extension and strengthening of carpet security”. There were aerial strikes on <br>revolutionary masses and leadership of the par ty. There is massive war of negative propaganda  with <br>the help of corporate media against not only the revolutionary movement but on each and every <br>voice of dissent. Intellectuals, Writers, Poets, Human Rights activists, Students, Tribal activists, <br>Trade Un ion leaders, farmer leaders and all progressive forces are being targeted through this <br>policy in the name “pen -yielding” Maoists.  <br>Surajkund policy is crucial for the BJP to win the General Election in 2024 and to fulfill its <br>design to make India into a cou ntry of Brahmanic Hindutva. The government is intensifying various <br>reform programs in the name of „development‟ in Maoist areas, Kashmir and the North East.  <br>Instead of developing cordial relations with the neighbouring countries, Modi's government  is  <br>strengthening border security and coastal security  and heightening the war like  tensions with the<br>neighbouring countries . In the light of 2024 General election, it is launching various repressive <br>campaigns in Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtr a, West Bengal, Keralam and so <br>on. It is putting an iron heel on the struggling oppressed sections in all states of the country. <br>Intense and unceasing campaigns are being unleashed in the Special Areas, Guerrilla Zones and <br>Guerrilla Bases and areas of revo lutionary movement. The government stipulated a time period of <br>2 years initially and had been continuously extending it, the recent one being 5 years. Presently it <br>decided to launch “Operation Kagaar” to encircle the area of Maad.  <br>Now let us look at some o f our efforts comprising ideological - political, military, <br>organisational spheres and in United Front.  <br>Ideological -Political Work  <br>The party took up varied tasks centralizing the main task of overcoming the temporary <br>setback in the revolutionary movement at  the all India level.  <br>1. The document on „Changes in Relations of Production in India -Our Political Program‟ <br>released by the CC was taken among the entire ranks of the party as an educational campaign. <br>This is being followed by an in -depth understanding of  the situation in the respective areas and <br>adopting corresponding tactics.  <br>2. A campaign was launched for two years and a Key paper released on the occasion in <br>October in order to fight back Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism. The paper highlights the concrete <br>conditions that led to the emergence RSS in the year 1925, its role in the freedom struggle and its <br>rise to political power in the year 2014. The essential features of Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism <br>have been made out in the key paper.  Theoretical analysis h as been done on the issue of religion <br>and Indian society from Marxist perspective. The  paper defines Indian fascism as “comprador <br>bureaucratic, feudal fascism”. In order to combat Hindutva fascism, our party framed a program. <br>The campaign shall be a large scale propaganda and agitation in the coming two years against the <br>theoretical ideology of the Sangh Parivar, its politics and its fascist practice and attacks, by <br><br><br>mobilizing the vast revolutionary, democratic, secular, patriotic forces and oppressed peopl e so as <br>to politically isolate and defeat it and contribute to advance the New Democratic Revolutionary <br>movement.  <br>3. Our Party participated in the seminar through sending a Paper to the seminar held  on <br>„Imperialism and War ‟ conducted by NDFP in mid -October  last year  in a European country. T he <br>seminar paper based on the analysis of imperialism made by the great Marxist teacher Comrade <br>Lenin. It stated that  the present situation shows the intensification of the  fundamental <br>contradictions of capitalism in the era of imperialism.  The paper wrote about the earlier World <br>Wars and analysed the present situation of looming danger of another World War. It wrote about <br>its understanding provided by Comrade Lenin that the world proletariat must fight to end imperialist  <br>war and in case it starts, must take up the task of „transforming the war into a civil war‟. It ended <br>with the quote of the great Marxist teacher Comrade Mao that the present trend in the world is of <br>Revolution.  <br>4. It issued a Joint Statement on Russia -Ukraine war and a joint declaration on the occasion <br>of the 130th Birth Anniversary of Comrade Mao.  <br>5. It issued a statement and a video on the occasion of the 55th Foundation Day of Communist <br>Party of Philippines.  <br> <br>Coming to ideological -political work within the party, applying the Marxist principle of „from <br>the masses to the masses‟, our Party was successful in conducting several political campaigns <br>and movements in the last one year with the active involvement of P arty committees, PLGA, <br>United Front and revolutionary masses. The CC called upon the democratic, revolutionary <br>organisations to fight back the various anti -people bills brought forth by the BJP government at the <br>centre such as Uniform Civil Code, Digital P rotection Data Bill and the New Forest Conservation <br>Act. It exposed the reality in the Women‟s Reservation Bill that would not come into <br>implementation for a long time even so. It extended solidarity to the people of Manipur struggling <br>against the divisive  policies of the BJP government also in the state. It extended solidarity to the <br>national liberation movement of Palestine where the people are facing heavy bombings and <br>killings from the Israeli Zionists with the support of US imperialists and other weste rn powers.  <br>A statement was issued by our CC on the occasion of  World Proletariat May Day for consolidating <br>the proletariat class against the threat of Imperialist wars. Messages  were circulated by our CC on the <br>occasion of observation of Martyrs day on July 28, the celebration of Party Foundation Day on 21st <br>September and the PLGA Day on 2nd December. These celebrations and other occasions of<br>meetings and demonstrations where the  effigies of Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu and Narendra <br>Modi were burnt in protest to Israel war on Palestine, Corporatization and Militarization was <br>opposed invigorated the Party and the revolutionary masses with revolutionary zeal and in <br>countering the h einous propaganda on our Party and the revolutionary movement by the enemy.  <br>The party took up several political and military education campaigns to educate the cadres <br>of the Party, PLGA and United Front. Special meetings of women activists of various ranks  were <br>held in continuation to those in the earlier years. These meetings helped to deeply understand the <br>problems faced in the process of their participation in the revolutionary movement and to work for a <br>better understanding of the cadres towards patriar chy. With the efforts in the past years the <br>revolutionary movement witnessed increase in women‟s leadership at various levels and also <br>recruitment. Recruitment Campaigns were taken up at the mass level in villages, towns, districts <br>and cities of India. Spe cial classes were held on Mode of Production, Nationality question and the <br>Political Resolution of the CC in the Special Areas, Special Guerrilla Zones and States.  <br>Military work  <br>The main effort in the military sphere was to defeat Brahmanic Hindutva fascis m and <br>counter -revolutionary Surajkund policy as a part of overcoming the temporary setback in the <br>revolutionary movement. Following the dictum of “learn warfare from warfare”, PLGA comrades <br>gained new experience in the battlefield. The enemy forces compris ed of National Security Guards <br>and Garuda forces of the Indian Air Force under the direction of Home Minister Amit Shah <br><br><br>launched an aerial attack to inflict severe damage to our leadership. But the alertness and strong <br>counter offensive tactics of our PLGA  comrades nullified the nefarious plan of the enemy. In that <br>retaliatory action 3 commandos of Garuda and NSG forces were annihilated and 6 commandos <br>were injured. Further, three modern combat helicopters were badly damaged. This heroic counter -<br>offensive h ighly motivated the PLGA forces and revolutionary masses whereas the morale of the <br>enemy forces was profoundly demoralized.  <br>In the last one year under the guidance of our Party several guerrilla actions were taken up <br>by our PLGA forces. PLGA made efforts t o intensify and widen guerrilla war with the aim to <br>overcome the temporary setback and advance the revolutionary movement. Some of the <br>prominent ones are as follows:  <br>On 26th April, 2023 in Darba Division in Aranpur our PLGA guerrillas annihilated 10 Distri ct <br>Reserve Guards (DRG) in IED blast through Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign. This has <br>brought nightmares to enemy forces. The daring Aranpur ambush was unexpected and shocked <br>the enemy with a tunnel being dug beneath the main road where mines were arr anged.  <br>In Bihar -Jharkhand of Eastern Regional Bureau region, our brave PLGA warriors are <br>showing infinite courage and war skills in resisting fascist onslaught from past one year. In West <br>Singhbhum region of Jharkhand, our PLGA comrades wiped out 15 polic e and injured 90 police <br>forces in the unceasing patrols of the government armed forces of the central and the state <br>governments.  <br>In the several guerrilla actions in guerrilla zones and red resistance areas a total of 75 <br>police personnel were wiped out and 163 were injured. Our PLGA annihilated some police <br>informers, 10 anti -people elements, particularly fascist BJP leaders in the past one year. Our Party <br>has taken special TCOCs during elections to state assemblies.  <br>The revolutionary people and their militia , the base force of PLGA dug thousands of spike <br>holes in order to restrict the capricious movements of the police personnel. Revolutionary masses <br>developed general alert system like firing crackers when the police personnel enter revolutionary <br>areas.  <br>There  are incidents where the PLGA could break the encirclement of the police forces <br>through strong retaliation like in Odisha. There were serious losses too. In Bihar -Jharkhand, five <br>comrades of which two are members of SAC were killed through poison in an ene my covert action. <br>In Dandakaranya a DvC member died in a covert operation in firing. Three comrades were caught <br>as they were going to make a guerrilla action in Gadchiroli. A Commander of  Local Organising Squad  <br>(LOS ) was caught and killed in Telangana.  <br>Special Military leadership training programs were held in several zones and divisions in the <br>last one year, with the objective to train the Politico -Military leadership corresponding to the <br>changes in the military tactics of the enemy.   <br>United Front  <br>The Revolutionary People‟s Committees (RPC) and the Revolutionary Mass Organisations <br>(RMO) worked with the task to fight back the present reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive of<br>the enemy in order to overcome the temporary setback in the revolutionary mov ement. Thousands <br>of revolutionary masses were mobilised in the revolutionary land reform campaign of the RPC held <br>early every year. Other revolutionary development activities were taken up to raise the living <br>standards of the people. The RPCs also held peo ple‟s courts to eliminate the enemy‟s intelligence <br>network in the villages.  <br>The RMOs took up struggles against the setting up of new police camps in the areas of <br>revolutionary movement and against fake encounters. lakh of people mobilised to observe the <br>Martyrs week and to celebrate other revolutionary days. The people participated with utmost vigor <br>in the meetings. The RMOs also implemented the call given by ICSPWI to celebrate Martyrs Day <br>for the whole month of July. This helped the masses of our country to know about the revolutionary <br>heroes of the world who laid down their lives for the cause of socialist revolution.  <br>Several mass movements such as against Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism, displacement, <br>Corporatisation -Militarisation both legal and underground mass movements were built in the past <br><br><br>one year  in towns, plain areas and cities, against Corporatization -Militarization of Forest belts, <br>against imperialist loot of natural resources of the country, against displacement due to corporate <br>development model, against the amendments of Forest Conservation Act and  the draconian Acts <br>and for the implementation and protection  of Panchayats Extension to Special Areas Act  (PESA ). <br>On various occasions along with intellectuals, students, human rights activists and civi l <br>society we form ed united platforms against state repression, illegal arrests, detentions, fake <br>encounters and aerial bombings. The RMOs took up the program of boycott of elections called by <br>the party. The people of Guerrilla Base Areas totally boycotted the elections.  <br>People demonstrated in large numbers against the fake encounter of two villagers of <br>Gomme near Koyilibeda of Kanker district in C hhattisgarh. Following this, an indefinite <br>demonstration was launched.  <br>People‟s  Cultural  Organizations  in the pa st one year undertook several programs including <br>making of audio and video presentations to  propagate  progressive, New Democratic and <br>communist values in the masses. It also took up  special  programs to expose Brahmanical Hindutva <br>Fascism in  forms of songs,  plays, dance, poetry and short films. The revolutionary cultural artists <br>are upholding the mass struggles in their cultural programs and immediately responding to the <br>ongoing developments in the domestic and international spheres, against state repression  and <br>martyrs.  <br>Several students and teachers organisations are working together against the New Education Policy <br>of RSS -BJP to saffronise and privatise the education system. They are also raising their voice against the <br>rise in the cost of education and cur tailment of "academic freedom" in higher education institutes. Several  <br>urban Mass Organisations are working together such as the students‟ organisations against <br>ragging, several kinds of organisations against BHF and in solidarity to Palestine. Acting on t he <br>call of the party to take up demonstrations in solidarity to Palestine, people of various areas of the <br>revolutionary movement in the country held meetings, processions and protest activities. A special <br>propaganda campaign was taken up in protest to the repressive measures on the revolutionary <br>movement in Jharkhand that was followed by all India Bandh on December 22nd. People blocked a <br>Railway line in Jharkhand on the occasion demanding a stop to police patrols into the villages and <br>setting up of police c amps.  <br>In the given international and domestic situation, there is a rise in the people‟s struggles and <br>resistance. There is a rise in people‟s struggles for right to land and forest, against land mafia and <br>against corporatization -militarization  even in those areas from where our Party had to temporarily <br>retreat due to enemy's severe repression. The  process of organising the people in secret organs, <br>building armed formations, joining youth in PLGA and thus rebuilding the revolutionary movement <br>in such areas is going on. The people of the country are further in the path of fighting for their right <br>to jal -jungle -zameen -ijjat-adhikar (water -forest -land-self-respect -political power ). The situation is <br>growing further favourable for revolution.  <br>The part y understands that the fascist repression is going to intensify in the coming days <br>and also that anti -Brahmanic Hindutva Fascist movements will come into being with great intensity. <br>Isolating the enemy politically is the need of the hour. We need to unite the anti -Brahmanic <br>Hindutva Fascist, anti -Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeois, anti -feudal and anti -Imperialist forces <br>and work to bury Imperialism.
