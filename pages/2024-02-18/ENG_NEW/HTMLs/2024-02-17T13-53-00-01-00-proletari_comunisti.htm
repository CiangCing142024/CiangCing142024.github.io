 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Meloni government is a racist, imperialist and therefore 
 addresses the problems of the Mediterranean, Africa, the problems of 
 immigrants with a racist and imperialist logic. AND, 
 involuntarily, he declared him on the occasion of the day of the 
 February 15 with the information to the Council of Ministers, when 
 Meloni spoke of "Caivano model".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Caivano, how yes 
 you know, is the neighborhood of the province of Naples where i 
 chilled facts, the violence and exploitation of the girls, where there is 
 a high density of the Camorra presence of various kinds that 
 It has always controlled the territory, with complicity - you want 
 or not - of politicians, state, institutions and part of the forces 
 of the order.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When it's 
 The Caivano case was bursted there was a ambaradam in this reality, 
 with government, interior ministers, etc. etc. who have, in fact, 
 built in the neighborhood, with a logic of militarization, a 
 "Model" of self -styled fight against the Camorra.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Speak about 
 "Caivano model" on the migrants front means 
 objectively consider all
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 criminal migrants, Camorristi, 
 Violeators and so on. And the imagination you want to build is 
 of a government that addresses and treats the question in this way 
 of migrants, then with a police model, with a model 
 expulsive, with a prison model against migrants, 
 the great mass of migrants who arrives on our coasts later 
 inhuman and inaen -arthire trips, with everything that now all know: 
 what happens in Libya, what happens in other countries of 
 North Africa towards migrants and what happens in 
 sea, and the massacre of Cutro, the shipwreck that also saw die 
 women and children, it is there to represent it during the first 
 Meloni government phase.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is the 
 logic that guides this government in treating the story of migrants. 
 To this are added the news that the Meloni government has built 
 through the Italian-Albanian pact with which migrants come 
 deported to Albania, locked up in CPR type prison structures, 
 managed directly by Italian military and police personnel with 
 the collaboration of a government of servants of the servants such as the current 
 Albanian government. In order to be able to mistreat them and silence 
 Expel them and fall into hell from which they came.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is the other 
 I wait, the imperialist aspect of the question. An aspect 
 imperialist who involves a relationship with countries - such as Albania but 
 in particular those who are on the African side of 
 Mediterranean: Libya, Tunisia - with which they establish themselves 
 relationships and relationships by financing them, in exchange for carrying out on behalf 
 of Italy the role of blocking of the wave of migrants, with 
 the goal not only to hunt migrants but also to increase the 
 economic control over the economies of these countries in favor of 
 Masters of Italian multinationals.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  State money 
 used to finance under this guise, once called “Piano 
 Mattei ”, another time called in another way, but with the same 
 identical objective: to practice a racist and imperialist policy 
 towards the Mediterranean and the Balkans with whom to establish one 
 neo colonial relationship that distantly recalls African politics 
 of Mussolini and imperialism in general.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that if 
 Migrants are the main victims of this policy, if the countries 
 On the Mediterranean, through these bonds, they confirm their nature 
 of countries oppressed by imperialism - that is, by our imperialism - 
 Peoples must get rid of their accomplices of imperialism 
 and fight the imperialist presence in the area and in particular 
 the Italian one naturally, in addition to the French one and any other 
 country that operates in North Africa towards these countries, with them 
 intentions of the Italian government and often in competition with the state e 
 The Italian government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is in ours 
 Country that is fighting, however, the main battle, it is we who 
 We must fight our racist/imperialist government and no one 
 other. It cannot be rewarded on Europe that every now and then 
 raises the problems of human rights and the character of the action of 
 This government but then it is well that dirty work does it 
 Italy and contributes in this way to curb the wave of 
 migrants who, in the large part, does not remain in Italy, but pours out 
 in the economically strongest countries and where there are migrant communities 
 More, long date and much larger. So you can't count 
 on Europe as a brake on racist politics, imperialist of 
 Italian government. It's up to us to make the "clean work" for this way 
 say, fight against the policies of this government, overturn 
 This government, build another country, another government, another 
 State, welcoming and solidarity, which builds an alternative to 
 capitalist, racist, imperialist of this government, of 
 previous governments, of future governments of the owners and governments 
 European imperialists.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other question 
 Which binds to politics towards migrants is prison policy.
 </p>

 And on this one 
 The further stage was the meeting with Romania.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  They meet 
 Italy and Romania. Italy confirms its role in NATO and a 
 side of Ukraine in the interimperialist war for Interposed 
 person who takes place in this country, who involves sending weapons, 
 soldiers and troops in this chessboard and moreover in Romania in 
 particular, as one of the border countries in this war that 
 It can be involved. To this adds the so -called plan 
 empty-chorches. There is another way to expel migrants and of 
 send them to serve the so -called "pain" in the country of origin e 
 This would concern Romanian prisoners who are in ours 
 village.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are 
 radically contrary to this plan because if they run away from 
 Romania is because it is an anti -worker and anti -popular regime, it is a 
 Wild capitalist regime, reactionary, is an alleged regime 
 to the interests of imperialism and therefore treats his people in the 
 Worst possible way and it is one of the regimes that you run away. And if 
 you run away, the last thing we have to do is to return them to a 
 regime, moreover if they were migrants detained in ours 
 country for reasons related to crimes that they would have committed in ours 
 country, would be a real prisons, another 
 baroles of a barbaric type, contrary to human rights and rules 
 elementary of international law, for which there are countries in 
 to which the crimes are committed but for their relationship of more countries 
 rich, imperialists, you can take the prisoners and send them in 
 their country to serve the sentence, that is, to contract the prison there.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is too 
 racism, this too is a liberticidal, inhuman policy, too 
 This is imperialism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Explain calmly, tranquility, but with 
 decision to the workers, to the proletarians of our country is a task 
 ours that cannot be contracted to the newspapers nor to 
 associations that are solidarity with migrants who already do a lot and 
 less than ever to the Church, which certainly puts its word to us 
 good, which many times sounds like criticism, to denial about policies 
 of the government. However, frankly, we don't think that this action of the 
 Church has never changed substantially nothing in the policies of 
 governments and also of our government. With all due respect to Pope Francis.
