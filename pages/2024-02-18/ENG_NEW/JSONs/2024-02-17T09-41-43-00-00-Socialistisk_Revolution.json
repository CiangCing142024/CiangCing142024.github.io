This method is that when the police see young people being in the company of people who are allegedly criminals or are gang members, they will reach out to the parents of the young people and talk to them. The police will generally also increase their presence in public space.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  Police have declared that they are actively working to prevent young people from being involved in crime.

Instead, you will surely see this new task force being abused to harass masses with the origin of oppressed nations further.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/02/17/nordjyllands-politi-og-aalborg-kommune-opretter-saerlig-taskforce/", "type": "article", "title": "North Jutland Police and Aalborg Municipality create special Taskforce", "description": "After rising gang crime in Aalborg, with several months of shooting episodes and stabbing, the North Jutland Police and Aalborg Municipality have decided to create a special task force to\u2026", "modified time": "2024-02-17T09:41:43+00:00", "author": ["socialistiskrevolution"], "categories": ["Uncategorized"]}
