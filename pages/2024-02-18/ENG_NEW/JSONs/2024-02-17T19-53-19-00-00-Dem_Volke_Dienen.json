The punk scene grew up in the context of the rise of the fascist \"British National Party\", reflected the rebellion of young people against the monarchist authorities and fascist elements in the United Kingdom; Nevertheless, the scene was repeatedly hiked by fascist elements, which hiked brawls at concerts of bands with progressive songs such as Sham 69.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p>\n  <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2GQMIXGRjaw\" title=\"Sham 69 - If the Kids are United\" width=\"912\">\n  </iframe>\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n  The sex pistols were particularly known with the two songs \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Anarchy in the U.K.\". Her \u201cprotest\u201d also included the obvious wearing of fascist symbols such as swastika t-shirts; But her songs were better, like the parody of the British national anthem:\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: center;\">\n  God save the Queen\n  <br/>\n  The fascist regime\n  <br/>\n  They made you a moron\n  <br/>\n  A potential H bomb\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  God save the Queen\n  <br/>\n  She ain't no human being\n  <br/>\n  There is no future\n  <br/>\n  In England's dreaming\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: center;\">\n </p>\n <p>\n  <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8fLOJswWtk\" title=\"The Sex Pistols - God Save The Queen\" width=\"912\">\n  </iframe>\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n  Many of the advanced bands were part of the \"Rock Against Racism\" concert series, which was directed against British pop stars, among other things, who drew attention to themselves with evil reactionary headlines, as Eric Clapton (\"Keep Britain White!\") Or or David Bowie (expressed his support for fascism and his admiration for Hitler in interviews with the \"Playboy\", among others). Also in the FRG there was quickly a counterpart to \"Rock Against Racism\" with \"Rock against Right\", which-from the communist federal government-was not yet such a bourgeois-democratic meaning. In these actions in England, however, it can also be kept in mind that many activities against the British National Party and their influence of leadership of the Trotskyists were subject to.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p>\n  <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcW8VNwYvL0\" title=\"The Clash - The Guns of Brixton (Official Audio)\" width=\"926\">\n  </iframe>\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n </p>\n <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; text-align: justify;\">\n  The Clash - also part of \"Rock Against Racism\" - landed their biggest hits with \"London Calling\" and \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\", but also had far more political and combative numbers. In 1979 - before the London workers' part of the London was actually an uprising against the police - the song \"Guns of Brixton\" was released, which deals with the situation of a son of Jamaican immigrants in the quarter, which between police force and the consequences of the Economic crisis grows up. In keeping with this, \u201cGuns of Brixton\u201d already consists largely of elements of the rocksteady / reggae, which at that time became popular by the migrants in England. However, only a few black bands were commercially successful, most likely to be called the song \"Pass the Dutchie\" from the musical Youth, 1982. In 1979 the label 2 Tone Records was founded, under which the Ska - Sprover of Rocksteady and Reggae in Jamaica - a revival in the United Kingdom experienced, where mainly white bands like \"Madness\" made a name for itself with their cover version of \"One Step Beyond\", \"The Specials\" or \"The Beat\". In addition to these groups, the fusion of elements of the SKA and the skinhead scene also found their expression in \u201c2 tone\u201d, the best-known example was the \u201cBad Manners\u201d.
