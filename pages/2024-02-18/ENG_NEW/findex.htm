<strong>
   Patiala, District, February 17, 2024:
  </strong>
  Amidst the ongoing farmer protest, the Communist Party of India (Maoist) has extended its support to the demonstrators stationed currently along the Punjab-Haryana border.
 </p>
<p>
  According to a copy of the press release issued by the Maoist party, the Maoists have extended their support to the one-day shutdown call given by the farmer unions on Friday, February 16.
 </p>
<p>
  Via the press release, the Maoist party has alleged that the incumbent union government is corporate friendly and has been treating the farmers as enemies of the State. Further, while making an appeal to the masses for their support to the said protest the Maoists in the press release alleged that the government has continued to bar the entry of the farmers at the Shambhu village border.
 </p>
<p>
  The press release further claimed that all the demands of the farmers are legitimate but the government is not willing to fulfill them.

 During an attempt to co -ordinate a common framework during the general
 <br>
 Assembly by members of ARA and KNE (of any member of both of them
 <br>
 Forces were not a member of FS PAPI) showed complete depreciation until the exhortations of leaving the racing moves from the debate. This reveals the attitude and perspective of the forces that swear in the name of "unity" and "unity". Public affairs
 <br>
 Frames at the General Assembly, two banners of the club in demonstration and organizational confrontations on the road. This is the unity that they are proclaimed, and they exclude political forces from writing a common framework.
 <br>
<br/>
 On the crucial issue of the Reminder, the KNEAK Conditions concluded "no tooling of the remote control to undermine our struggle and our occupation" (which even this wording even denounces the remoteness). In the sealed framework uploaded by the NCAK the proposal appears. But it does not appear in the sealed
 <br/>
 Framework uploaded by KNE. This is part of the overall attitude of these forces that
 <br/>
 see clubs as a stamp and have nothing to seal differently
 <br/>
 texts and download different banners of the student club in mobilizations.
 <br/>
 The denial is also the refusal of counting the votes by the PCS and the
 <br/>
 ESAK and the decision, and there was a high possibility that there would be no quorum. THE
 <br/>
 The excuse was that the result is clear and that we should not get in "obstacle
 <br/>
 In the race. " However, it was the KNE itself who put it that the assembly can not make a decision
 <br/>
 no quorum for the remote examination while it can take for occupation without raising the issue
 <br/>
 For the remote examination! When we set that the votes should be counted
 <br/>
 Challenging answer that we are with government and DAP! These forces
 <br/>
 They perceive collective procedures as stamps of validation of their decisions,
 <br/>
 without respecting student clubs.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Quorum is not a 'bureaucratic' issue of compliance for formal reasons,
 <br/>
 But for politicians. In order to take a decision by a general meeting you must
 <br/>
 reflects and represents the student club. If we today accept such
 <br/>
 Practices, then DAP and PASP with similar practices and even less people will be able to
 <br/>
 decide for us without us. Would these same attitude have the same attitude if
 <br/>
 Did they feel that they were not gathering the necessary votes to vote for their context? These
 <br/>
 Practices give the DAP to come out to speak minorities who are squatting. THE
 <br/>
 Case in the reconstruction of the student movement and the massage of the matches that
 <br/>
 gives the student movement, it concerns the students themselves who must become subject to
 <br/>
 Fight, without waiting for the "elected saviors" to solve their problems.
 <br/>
 Just for this we cannot accept to make decisions for students without
 <br/>
 students and without clear results of the decisions made.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Student mobilizations so far are definitely promising and can win.
 <br/>
 In view of the vote we must escalate our struggles so as not to pass the
 <br/>
 Pierrakakis Bill.

<p>
  We have 
  Wait a few days before taking a floor in front of the resolution 
  on the Askatasuna issued by the Municipality of Turin. Let me say, the reactions 
  broken down to which we attended made us laugh under and above the 
  moustache.
 </p>
<p>
  We seem to have understood that to collect signatures against askatasuna e 
 For legality, Augusta Montaruli will go, the one sentenced for 
 Pecurated for buying Swarovski bags and luxury dinners with 
 money from the region. Congratulations! Someone a little more awake than her in 
 Party made her understand that, to go and ask for around 
 Askatasuna, the town's right could end up in the air. But 
 We understand that for those who live in politics since he was 16, reality 
 Outside the buildings it may appear a little faded. It seems to us to have 
 understood that there are those who dream of a police station inside the social center. 
 See the level of rovate of the liver reached due to us from 
 those same police unions applauding the killers of 
 Federico Aldrovandi is yet another medal. We then saw four 
 pilgrims with banners against Aska in front of Palazzo di Città in 
 an oceanic manifestation that would not have blocked a not 
 scooter. Finally, we saw a prosecutor in the ball try to 
 intervene in extremis with yet another synchronized precautionary measures 
 with the wishes of the city right. Fleas on the back of one 
 reality that animates their nightmares for almost 40 years. Since the meaning of 
 ridiculous missing these court jesters, it's up to us to be serious and 
 Try to explain what we are and what this “exit represents for us 
 from above".
 </p>
<p>
  We do not demand that it makes consent, we understand that many do not go 
 down, we understand that this is incomprehensible to the prosecutor but we start 
  From a fact: many young people have approached and continue 
  to approach the reality of the Askatasuna Social Center. Not for 
 obscure manipulations of a group of violent vicious, as they would like 
 Make the Quaesturini delusions believe, but because the askatasuna feels a 
 respond to a need that goes beyond the property of Corso Regina 
 47. The need for a common dream, the desire to build a power 
 collective far from the hypocrisy of institutional policy but capable 
  to weigh on the city. It is from this need that a reality was born that, 
 As we have seen in these days, it has grown to become 
 obsession of the right and bad awareness of a left that too much 
 he often abdicated the role of representing his part, that of 
 oppressed. In a world where resignation and individualism reigns we are 
 people with the ball to do politics. In a world to do politics 
 It means getting paid we understand that to do politics 
 you have to pay. Energy, time and also, sometimes, freedom. Why the 
 History of the peoples who fight gives us back the fact that legality does not 
 always coincides with social justice and that serves to fight to do 
 prevailing rights, even the fundamental ones, on the interests of 
 part.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
  Since we committed the unforgivable sin of giving legs and 
 continuity to the protests in Val di Susa, the state has decided to do 
 pay a very high price to dozens of militants. In about ten years 
 The suspects were over 200, perhaps the highest number for a 
 political collective since the 1970s. This against a level of 
 all in all conflict extremely contained both with respect to history 
 of our country is compared to what we see elsewhere in Europe. But 
 On the other hand, there is little to complain: if there is a laughter it is increasingly difficult 
  swim free. Many, sometimes just teenagers, have served 
 Prison prison, many long house arrest. The processes yes 
  they are resolved for the most part in nothing done, convictions 
 "Bagatellari" or even acquittals. But this cares little, why 
 The intent has always been only to weaken the old and scare the 
  young. Many have continued, however, incredibly, to join 
  to a project that, without many menate, tries to put themselves at the service of the 
  social conflict. Police Headquarters therefore open a second front, 
 the one to try to disarticulate the link between askatasuna and the city, 
 With levels of infamy of primati guinness. If the bad model e 
 Violent does not work, let's try to pass them by Ras and Magnaccia. There 
 Digos comes to chase those who passed off crack in front of the school 
 Elementary of Vanchiglia to snatch a complaint against the boys 
 of the social center that would have dared to pull them a kick in the ass. 
 Traces a violent husband kicked out of a housing employment for 
 Ask him to identify the bad guys who would put him on the door. AND 
  Getting culminating up to the attempted operation "subversive association" 
 of 2022. The model was to be that of the employed kindergarten of via 
 Alessandria: associative crime, eviction and demolition of the building. 
 However, there is a hitch, "the subversive association" is not signed by 
 Gip and, to save part of the theorem, the Review Court pulls 
 Outside the hat the crime of "criminal association", the eviction 
 goes upstream. Therefore the third front opens, that of attrition 
 administrative. Interventions of the firefighters, seals, mezzucci, 
 attempt to pass a recreational space in which no one has ever 
 Taken a lira for disco. The goal is one, remove the ground 
 under the feet to a reality that does not bend and does not break, e 
 The evident sought -after epilogue.
 </p>
<p>
  In this context it seemed fundamental to us to resume 
 The initiative. Politically relaunch to get out of the corner in which i 
 our opponents would have liked to keep us. We never had 
 problems with the fact that institutions recognize the value of how much 
 made from below (the after -school, the children's parties, the music, the 
 gym, cinema), indeed. CSA Murazzi himself was granted by the Municipality 
  back in 1989 after a series of occupations, evictions and 
 mobilizations. And from then on, it seems to us that everything can be attributed, 
 except that they have been indulgent with the Turin -left center, 
 from the employment of the DS headquarters to protest against the arrest of 
 Ocalan back in 1999. Following, the harsh disputes against the 
 left of war that bombed Belgrade and the raid in the center 
 social in mode that anticipated what happened to the diaz of 
 Genoa. The story is long ... and it comes until Friday's operation 
 last with about ten new restrictions and prohibitions of residence for 
 Very young companions and companions.
 </p>
<p>
  The important thing for us is how we get to what it can be, a 
 Second of the contexts, a useful, useless or deleterious passage. The action 
 politics is shaped upside down by the need to be recognized 
 From the institutions? Worse, you get recognized to try to get 
 A place in the sun for some heads or capes? Or it is built 
 patiently a rooting until a busy space becomes a 
  Reference point essential for the city? Having said that, for 
 We the social center has always been a means and not an end. If for 
 some reason, strictly politicalist, this path in the future 
 should be raised, the fact that it is already evident for one does not change 
  Great slice of Turin. From the children of the kindergarten in via Balbo who come to 
  celebrate the birthday with their friends inside Aska, up to 
 boys who came from the Turin province to dance on the notes of the 
 Tecno nobody waited for a piece of paper to find out that askatasuna is 
  Already a common good of the city.
 </p>
<p>
  We specify a couple of points, to dissipate any doubt and remove 
 A few crickets for the head. We are more than available to invest the 
 our energies to improve the safety of the building and guarantee a 
  greater usability and facilitate access. Because we are convinced, 
 together with many others, that the center has now become a common heritage 
  that goes beyond the political collective that has taken care of it until today, 
 ensuring the performance of many activities for the city. Our 
 commitment in this sense, however, does not mean in any way to abdicate bonds 
  that we built with the Vanchiglia neighborhood and our commitment 
 politician in the area. We were there for this neighborhood when it was 
 a desert of services. We were there when the administrations have 
 started a process to transform it into the "table", releasing 
 licenses to the right and missing. We were there when we wanted 
 militarize the neighborhood to repress a nightlife moved there 
 of strength from the wicked choices made at Palazzo di Città. Here we are 
 states to give outdoor activities to the children of the neighborhood during 
  the pandemic when the families were left alone by 
 institutions. We understand that for politicians who think with deadlines 
 electoral at 4 or 5 years are secondary dynamics, but for us who 
 We shaped Vanchiglia's life and were shaped by it, 
 They are central things. As far as we are concerned, we are at the beginning of a 
 path, everything can still happen: it is an unexplored ground for us but 
  We practice it with the same determination and partiality with which from 
 decades are a living part of the struggles in the area, in the city, in the valley and 
  Wherever it will be necessary to mobilize.
 </p>
<p>
  So it is, it seems to us
 </p>
<p>
  ______________________________________________________________________________
 </p>
<p>
  Turin repression laboratory is a recurring frame and a reality 
  that those who protest in the city live on the skin. The choice of askatasuna e 
 of the Municipality to undertake a path of dialogue and experiment 
 New, such as the common good and co-design, breaks it.
 </p>
<p>
  Leaving 
  glimpse another possible city. And specific: city, because the 
 deliberates on the common good is to be read not as a resolution of a 
 public order problem, but as an idea of a living territory, where the 
  conflict is not neutralized and the participation enhanced. A 
 Another model of democracy. Utopia? The sterilization of a 
 Radical alternative experience?
 </p>
<p>
  Mind you. It won't be a 
 Easy route, it stands on a thin balance of balance. On the side 
 of askatasuna, there is the maintenance of a strong radicality in the context 
 of a frame shared with the Municipality; by the institutions, there is 
 the comparison with a political project and a protest that hit e 
 restless. But this is the complexity of a conflicting democracy, it is 
 the indicator of his good state of health. It is a signal 
 countercurrent compared to the image of a democracy that does not tolerate 
 the strikes, which represses eco-activism, which expels thought 
 divergent, as well as an atrophilic democracy.
 </p>
<p>
  It's a 
 "antagonist" experimentation, to resume provocatively 
 a label used in a disqualifying and generalizing sense, 
 Compared to the prevailing model: repressive, approval and passiveizing.
 </p>
<p>
  Between 
  The most evident connotations of Turin "repression laboratory", yes 
 reports judicial activism attentive to all possible violations 
  law, civil, criminal, administrative, experienced on 
 belonging to the No Tav movement and applied to those who act the conflict 
 social. It affects Reading on the Prosecutor's website that the pool of 
 magistrates who habitually deals with the crimes inherent in the protest is 
 colored under the item «terrorism and subversion of the order 
 democratic". Dissent and protest, far from being ascribable 
 to terrorism (the attempts in this regard were cassated by the same 
 judiciary) are not subversive of the democratic order but element 
 essential of democracy. The concept of a presumed order is 
  Far from a horizon that implies pluralism and discussion.
 </p>
<p>
  Certain, 
  The fulfillment of crimes must be pursued, but the criminal liability is 
 staff. Reasonableness and proportionality must be the parameter 
 To determine incriminating cases, precautionary measures and penalties, 
 How, even more so, the prevention measures adopted by the Quaestor, 
  Fascist retailed, of a lot (and more than) dubious legitimacy 
 constitutional. And then there is the violent behavior of the forces 
 of the order in protests. I think about May 1st, where the will to 
 prevent entry into the square at the social broken produces clashes 
 now "classics" (only in 2023 avoid, thanks to an intense dialogue 
 quote), to manganelli on anti -fascist students at university, 
 But the discussion can extend to the evictions of employed buildings or to the 
 Resistance to evictions.
 </p>
<p>
  Turin is a laboratory, but the trend is 
  Global: repressing, dissuading, intimidating the protest. It is a part of the 
  world that in the face of unsustainable inequalities, to the effects of a 
  increasingly violent competitiveness, it is armored.
 </p>
<p>
  Turin that 
 look beyond the stigmatization of social centers as a lair of 
 illegality and recognizes value to the autorganization of social activities e 
  cultural, to participation from below, indicates another path 
 possible, that - incidentally - it is in the sign of the Constitution. And the 
 attempt to grasp the potential of a category, the "good 
 common », as a way to rethink the public good as" of citizens ", 
 without anesthetizing the divergence, even radical, which ensures the 
 plural dynamism, vitality, the possibility of transformation, of the 
  democracy.
 </p>
<p>
  It will be up to the political forces in the field to ensure that this 
  is a different way to maintain "the strength of total criticism" 
 (Pasolini) without slipping into a "comfortable, smooth, reasonable, reasonable 
 Democratic non-libertà "(Marcuse).
 </p>
<p>
  It is a small step, the 
 deliberates and not eviction, which refers to the great clash on the way 
 understand democracy: democracy as a control tool e 
 power management or democracy against power, in the sign of one 
 effective social and political emancipation?

   We have returned these days from a short journey - but beautiful and 
 exciting - that we can define a journey of Marx and 
 In the footsteps of Marx's life and history, at least for that phase 
 in which he lived in the city of London.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   Was a 
 Journey with which on the one hand we wanted to honor Marx's memory 
 and that at the same time we considered a real 
 political initiative through which, retracing some places 
 significant of Marx's life, we reflected on what in 
 These years have studied through the training cycles 
 proletarian and revolutionary, in particular on specific texts of 
 Marx, such as the manifesto or the beginning of the capital.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   So a journey 
 which also fits into that concept that we call "guide 
 for revolutionary action ".
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   A stage 
 main of this trip, which however lasted a few days, is 
 He was at the Highgate cemetery, where Marx is buried.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   We arrived at 
 Small village of Highgate, a classically English village, 
 Very picturesque. A cute episode was the fact that in 
 Asking information to get to the cemetery smiled at us saying: 
 "But are you going to Marx's tomb?" In reality apart from the 
 maps we could have had, it was not difficult to reach this 
 place because there was like a sort of pilgrimage of people who 
 they went to the cemetery - and then towards the tomb of Marx - e 
 This has facilitated the path
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   In a classic 
 English day in gray sky, with a fairly temperature 
 fresh, we arrived at the cemetery, an English cemetery, with 
 scattered tombs, with quite different tombstones, without an apparent 
 scheme.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   The part where yes 
 Find Marx's tomb is faced with the biggest one in the 
 cemetery, also considered
   <span>

</p>

<i>
  the main one, where different are buried 
 Historical characters, writers, artists.
 </i>
<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   Taking the 
 country road that leads to the tomb, after a few minutes, to say 
 the truth, we immediately started to experience a certain emotion in 
 see the large marble head of Marx from afar from afar that dominates 
 The tomb, however surrounded by people. Approaching the emotion is 
 increased because it is true that we have seen it many times on books, 
 On the internet, in the photos, but seeing the plaque in presence is truly 
 A whole other thing.

<br>
  We stopped with other people. For a few minutes we have 
 observed the tomb from all sides, without saying anything, reading the 
 Registration with the names of the buried personalities: of course Karl 
 Marx, then his wife Jenny von Westphalen, the faithful Helene Demuth, the 
 daughter Eleanor.
 </br></i>
<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   We then have 
 heard that something more than a dutiful visit we should have 
 do, and so we pulled out the flags we had brought 
 Just to honor Marx's memory. And we took pictures, 
 one with the flag of our political organization and the other 
 as companions of the MFPR. Which was appreciated by some 
 passers -by who smiled at us and also gave us notes of 
 assent.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i style="text-align: center;">
<i style="text-align: left;">
    And then, since we had brought some texts by Marx, in particular the manifesto of the Communist Party written together with Engels, and the international worker, we made a sort of celebration, in the sense that we have read some specific passages of these two texts in front of the plaque aloud.

   The choice of 
 These passages wanted to try to bring - with so much humility 
 Of course - what is the true spirit of all written work 
 and made by Marx and his inseparable, an exceptional companion of 
 fight, Engels, but above all to remember ourselves, that is 
 to put ourselves today, what are the purposes and what it takes today 
 to the communists and the working class, the class of the proletariat for 
 affirm them.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

   After that 
 We decided to intone the international. We started a 
 Singing it slowly also in the sense of respect for the place, but in reality, 
 As we spontaneously sang the voice has increased. So 
 Then we sung it with a much higher voice. This created a nice 
 moment for a shed of people around us, 
 almost a circle, with some who started singing together with 
 we, others who have raised the fist, others who smiled at us and 
 they made hints of consent. At the end, some of these people do 
 they wanted to present, in particular a group of Indians that there 
 They greeted with a lot of heat, holding their hand. There were also 
 of young girls very happy and showed up like 
 militants of the Communist Party of Marxist India and wanted 
 Also take a photo with us next to the plaque. So two 
 Chinese young people, another person who wanted to tell us that it was a 
 Brazilian companion. So also two young British.

   It was a nice 
 moment, both international and internationalist and this was 
 also a great emotion, which is a bit what Marx said 
 in all his texts: a proletariat, a working class that does not have 
 homeland but which is united by what the struggle must be 
 revolutionary to overthrow the dominant bourgeois and build a 
 Truly different society.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   This moment is 
 very beautiful state, with all these companions we were together 
 there, in front of the plaque. We do not hide that when we are there 
 went we were really quite excited and with tears at 
 eyes, on the one hand of joy, on the other of respect, of honor, but 
 Even a little sadness of having to go away from that place.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   In the days 
 subsequent we tried to pay homage to Max by visiting 
 other places in his life, particularly in the Soho district, 
 One of the homes where Marx lived for several years, a neighborhood 
 where there was also the library where Marx went to study and a 
 Read and then, much further on, the street where there is Engels' house.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<i>
   So a journey 
 very beautiful, an exciting journey, a journey full of many things, 
 a political journey, a journey also ideological, which helped us e 
 It helps us to affirm what is the ideology of the proletariat and there 
 encourages to move forward on the necessary revolutionary journey 
 Today to the whole class.

</div>
<br>
<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The last recent feminicides are precisely of the last few days.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On February 14 there was the one in Cisterna di Latina, in which the mother of an ex -girlfriend of the murderer were killed. And the day before yesterday there was the killing of a 61 -year -old woman in Bolzano.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Since the beginning of this year there are already 8 feminicides, sometimes, as has happened in Cisterna di Latina, it is double femicide.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we want to focus a moment on this of Cisterna di Latina because there is an aspect that have highlighted few newspapers, but it is significant.
 </p>
<div style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The latter femicide was committed by a marshal of finance, but it is not the only committed by the police, of those who have the easy gun, because always in this country - which is not a great country, it is a matter of A reality of just over 36,000 inhabitants - in previous years, coincidentally, there have been 2 more femicides: one in 2018 at the hands of an appointed carabinieri who, not only did he shoot his wife but also killed his two daughters, then yes suicidate. In 2014 another: in this case a prison police officer killed his partner.
  <br>
  How come in the same country - not great - did these feminicides occur at the hands of the police or in any case committed by those who have the opportunity to have weapons?
 </br></div>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We immediately link this femicide to the decree that the Meloni government is preparing. It is said that the men of the police can always keep the gun with them, that is, in fact these men even at home, even in private situations, will always have the gun at hand. And clearly this will only feed the killings, the feminicides, by this type of men who evidently consider how "normal" react to situations of different choices from women, other than their will, shooting, killing.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As we have written other times, it is a war, a low intensity war against women, with femicides who are increasing, who are becoming almost daily, at least those who know each other, who arrive in the press, on television.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   These feminicides are made by new men, with certain patriarcalist conceptions, but above all with fascist conceptions, these are modern fascists because they are moved by hatred against women
  </b>
  who do not accept to be subordinated, who want to decide on their lives, who want to break bonds that become oppressive chains, and violent in some cases, who do not agree to be the one to "have to have their heads on the shoulders", as Meloni says, To be good women who mainly think about the family.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   And fascism, of which we now have an institutional expression in the government and in the representatives of this state, of these institutions, in the ministers that are part of this government, which produces a sort of modern patriarchy
  </b>
  Which is not old patriarchism, but is a new one, in a certain sense more social, more political, more ideological, more terrible, institutional, which therefore cannot be fought only with culture, with education, etc., but dev 'be fought with
  <b>
   The struggle to overthrow this modern fascist system.
  </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is because, as a writer said, they are not "ancient men", they are
  <i>
   "Modern ancient men, frustrated by the freedom that women rightly want, who feel like the theft of their freedom, of their properties on women
  </i>
  ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   Today this war against women is going to intensify because modern fascism is the construction of the system, to normal, of everything that is reactionary, male chauvinist, rotten;
  </b>
  And towards which the small, ineffective, measures that the Meloni government boasts are truly an absolute hypocrisy, because, at the same time, the ministers, exponents of brothers of Italy, the government party, issue statements and make campaigns Ideological and political for which the centrality of the role of women must be at home, it must be in taking care of the children and therefore everything that goes against this becomes provocation, it becomes that you have fault if then, in the face of these life choices Different, your husband, your ex, kills you.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Fascist humus makes it normal to react to women. As is normal in the USA, but not only in the United States, that men, boys, frustrated to arms and kill at the mass level, so for men it seems almost "obvious" that the reaction to women must be violent.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   In the face of this, however, a response of women rises, a response of struggle.
  </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On November 25, it was not obvious that there was the participation of half a million women and also of men, but above all in the vast majority of women, at the Rome event. It was an imposing event, it was also a different event from the others of the previous years, because it was full of anger, of determination. There were the signs that said "we are furious", "the witches are back".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today, it is also about March 8th, to raise, extend in every place, in every city, in every workplace - where, among other things, all another series of violence also take place: economic, living conditions , of discrimination, harassment towards women, workers - this struggle of women.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is a question of giving continuity, of giving strength, but above all we think that it is necessary to direct the struggle of women more and more towards a revolution that is a clean place of men who hate women, governments, states that women hate.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Saying enough to feminicides means more struggle, more mass struggle than women in every place, more dangerous struggle

 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  According to Police Inspector Claus Danø, police will use the so-called "knock-knock" method, which they should have good experience with in Aarhus and Copenhagen. This method is that when the police see young people being in the company of people who are allegedly criminals or are gang members, they will reach out to the parents of the young people and talk to them. The police will generally also increase their presence in public space.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Police have declared that they are actively working to prevent young people from being involved in crime. But it is obvious that they will never be able to solve this problem. They are already playing a reactionary role in our society, just as the frivolous gang environments do, just the police represent the reactionary bourgeois Danish state. We already know that the police are often out and
  <a href="https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2023/06/13/politiet-angriber-born-med-deres-hunde-masserne-fortsaetter-med-at-kaempe/">
   harassing young children
  </a>
  And workers based on their ethnicity, such as happened in
  <a href="https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2023/08/24/nordjyllands-politi-angriber-uskyldige/">
   neighborhood Vejgaard
  </a>
  . Many young people then see a connection between the officers who harass them, and the officers who protect fascists who burn the Qur'an or provoke the masses in other ways, creating a special image.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  If the police sincerely want to change, they must start with their own behavior, but it is clear that they will never try to improve or acknowledge that they have a problem. Instead, you will surely see this new task force being abused to harass masses with the origin of oppressed nations further.

  Four, and perhaps even more, at the moment has not been found under the rubble another worker, are the dead, our dead workers killed in the Megacantiere of Florence, and at least three workers are seriously injured.

    Meloni whose "conscience" makes her proclaim "a minute of silence".

<p>

<span style="font-family: times;">
<b>
     The masters make profits on the blood of the workers,
    </b>
    On their exploitation, using transferring workers, some immigrants! They cut safety, save on the materials, on the times of construction of the structures, on the checks. In the megacantiere there were 30 subcontracting companies; The client company is Villata spa is of
    <b>

<span style="font-family: times;">
<b>
     The Meloni government with the reform of the contract code

    He gave the go -ahead to the subcontracts, to the custody of the works even without tender, "green light" to the companies that to make more useful cut the costs of safety, contracts, workers' rights; Cuts that especially in construction sites mean accidents, dead. So what the "Minister of Business Consultants" speaks when with

  Announces further interventions? We should say: better that this government is stopped ..., because every provision is a worsening for workers.
 </span>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span style="font-family: times;">
    And let's not say it so much to say. Now the great works are announced for the realization of infrastructure interventions for the G7 in Puglia in June and is written: "Just yesterday the extraordinary commissioner for the work for the G7, Fulvio Maria Rescdata, was in the Prefecture in Bari to take stock of the Situation. Particularly narrow times led the government to opt for procurement without a race ... ". (Puglia newspaper of 16/E). What it means we can well imagine it: works done by tinated companies with political and institutional characters, beyond the skills, subcontracts entrusted quickly and fury without any preventive control, workers used as "slaughter meat", etc. etc.
   </span>
</span>
<span>
   In a situation where entire cities will be armored (Brindisi, Bari, 
 etc.) and therefore the checks, the interventions of the unions will be 
 prevented at most.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span style="font-family: times;">

     Other dead workers? Damn assassins!

<b>
   Maximum support for strikes, mobilizations, but of those who, the basic, class unions, fight every day for safety, for the rights of workers and are therefore repressed; Not to the declarations of those who, the leaders of the confederal unions, remember safety after the workers die, and on the other days they collaborate with companies or are absent

  (In the mega site of Esselunga what union interventions had been, were the RLS, the delegates?)

<p>
  A group of Israeli elite soldiers of the Givati brigade refused to take part in military operations in the Gaza Strip, accusing the army of neglecting its physical and psychological well-being, according to the publication of the Haaretz portal on Wednesday.
 </p>
<p>
  Since the Israeli army began the earthly invasion of Gaza at the end of October 2023, the Givati brigade, which includes elite fighters, has taken part in the most difficult bumps at the enclave and lost many of its leaders and members, forcing the leaders of the leaders army to “temporarily” from the battlefield.
 </p>
<p>
  Palestinian resistance groups repeatedly defeated Givati and other elite forces in Gaza, expelling them to certain areas after annihilating and injured many of their soldiers.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Terrified soldiers
 </h4>
<p>
  During a conversation with commanders, the soldiers claimed that they have no psychological structure to return to the battlefield and expressed fear that returning would put their lives at risk.
 </p>
<p>
  The newspaper reported that Army leaders have not yet decided to respond to the refusal of the soldiers to return to the foray.
 </p>
<p>
  Thousands of Israeli soldiers have had confirmed deaths and injuries in the Gaza War so far.
 </p>
<p>
  The estimate of Israeli military losses are much larger in media vehicles and leaked data from hospitals when compared to the official numbers declared by the Israeli army.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the Ministry of Health of Gaza, 28,663 Palestinians were murdered and 68,395 injured in the genocidal foray into Gaza began on October 7.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, at least 7,000 people are not in these data, as they are presumed to be killed among the wreckage of their homes in the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
<p>
  International and Palestinian organizations say most of the dead and injured are women and children.
 </p>
<p>
  Israeli aggression also resulted in the forced eviction of nearly two million people throughout the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of the outstanding in the overcrowded city of Rafah, near the border with Egypt - has become the largest exodus in Palestinian mass since the Nakba, in 1948.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Meloni government is a racist, imperialist and therefore 
 addresses the problems of the Mediterranean, Africa, the problems of 
 immigrants with a racist and imperialist logic. AND, 
 involuntarily, he declared him on the occasion of the day of the 
 February 15 with the information to the Council of Ministers, when 
 Meloni spoke of "Caivano model".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Caivano, how yes 
 you know, is the neighborhood of the province of Naples where i 
 chilled facts, the violence and exploitation of the girls, where there is 
 a high density of the Camorra presence of various kinds that 
 It has always controlled the territory, with complicity - you want 
 or not - of politicians, state, institutions and part of the forces 
 of the order.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When it's 
 The Caivano case was bursted there was a ambaradam in this reality, 
 with government, interior ministers, etc. etc. who have, in fact, 
 built in the neighborhood, with a logic of militarization, a 
 "Model" of self -styled fight against the Camorra.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Speak about 
 "Caivano model" on the migrants front means 
 objectively consider all
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 criminal migrants, Camorristi, 
 Violeators and so on. And the imagination you want to build is 
 of a government that addresses and treats the question in this way 
 of migrants, then with a police model, with a model 
 expulsive, with a prison model against migrants, 
 the great mass of migrants who arrives on our coasts later 
 inhuman and inaen -arthire trips, with everything that now all know: 
 what happens in Libya, what happens in other countries of 
 North Africa towards migrants and what happens in 
 sea, and the massacre of Cutro, the shipwreck that also saw die 
 women and children, it is there to represent it during the first 
 Meloni government phase.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is the 
 logic that guides this government in treating the story of migrants. 
 To this are added the news that the Meloni government has built 
 through the Italian-Albanian pact with which migrants come 
 deported to Albania, locked up in CPR type prison structures, 
 managed directly by Italian military and police personnel with 
 the collaboration of a government of servants of the servants such as the current 
 Albanian government. In order to be able to mistreat them and silence 
 Expel them and fall into hell from which they came.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is the other 
 I wait, the imperialist aspect of the question. An aspect 
 imperialist who involves a relationship with countries - such as Albania but 
 in particular those who are on the African side of 
 Mediterranean: Libya, Tunisia - with which they establish themselves 
 relationships and relationships by financing them, in exchange for carrying out on behalf 
 of Italy the role of blocking of the wave of migrants, with 
 the goal not only to hunt migrants but also to increase the 
 economic control over the economies of these countries in favor of 
 Masters of Italian multinationals.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  State money 
 used to finance under this guise, once called “Piano 
 Mattei ”, another time called in another way, but with the same 
 identical objective: to practice a racist and imperialist policy 
 towards the Mediterranean and the Balkans with whom to establish one 
 neo colonial relationship that distantly recalls African politics 
 of Mussolini and imperialism in general.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that if 
 Migrants are the main victims of this policy, if the countries 
 On the Mediterranean, through these bonds, they confirm their nature 
 of countries oppressed by imperialism - that is, by our imperialism - 
 Peoples must get rid of their accomplices of imperialism 
 and fight the imperialist presence in the area and in particular 
 the Italian one naturally, in addition to the French one and any other 
 country that operates in North Africa towards these countries, with them 
 intentions of the Italian government and often in competition with the state e 
 The Italian government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is in ours 
 Country that is fighting, however, the main battle, it is we who 
 We must fight our racist/imperialist government and no one 
 other. It cannot be rewarded on Europe that every now and then 
 raises the problems of human rights and the character of the action of 
 This government but then it is well that dirty work does it 
 Italy and contributes in this way to curb the wave of 
 migrants who, in the large part, does not remain in Italy, but pours out 
 in the economically strongest countries and where there are migrant communities 
 More, long date and much larger. So you can't count 
 on Europe as a brake on racist politics, imperialist of 
 Italian government. It's up to us to make the "clean work" for this way 
 say, fight against the policies of this government, overturn 
 This government, build another country, another government, another 
 State, welcoming and solidarity, which builds an alternative to 
 capitalist, racist, imperialist of this government, of 
 previous governments, of future governments of the owners and governments 
 European imperialists.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other question 
 Which binds to politics towards migrants is prison policy.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

<br>
 And on this one 
 The further stage was the meeting with Romania.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  They meet 
 Italy and Romania. Italy confirms its role in NATO and a 
 side of Ukraine in the interimperialist war for Interposed 
 person who takes place in this country, who involves sending weapons, 
 soldiers and troops in this chessboard and moreover in Romania in 
 particular, as one of the border countries in this war that 
 It can be involved. To this adds the so -called plan 
 empty-chorches. There is another way to expel migrants and of 
 send them to serve the so -called "pain" in the country of origin e 
 This would concern Romanian prisoners who are in ours 
 village.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are 
 radically contrary to this plan because if they run away from 
 Romania is because it is an anti -worker and anti -popular regime, it is a 
 Wild capitalist regime, reactionary, is an alleged regime 
 to the interests of imperialism and therefore treats his people in the 
 Worst possible way and it is one of the regimes that you run away. And if 
 you run away, the last thing we have to do is to return them to a 
 regime, moreover if they were migrants detained in ours 
 country for reasons related to crimes that they would have committed in ours 
 country, would be a real prisons, another 
 baroles of a barbaric type, contrary to human rights and rules 
 elementary of international law, for which there are countries in 
 to which the crimes are committed but for their relationship of more countries 
 rich, imperialists, you can take the prisoners and send them in 
 their country to serve the sentence, that is, to contract the prison there.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is too 
 racism, this too is a liberticidal, inhuman policy, too 
 This is imperialism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Explain calmly, tranquility, but with 
 decision to the workers, to the proletarians of our country is a task 
 ours that cannot be contracted to the newspapers nor to 
 associations that are solidarity with migrants who already do a lot and 
 less than ever to the Church, which certainly puts its word to us 
 good, which many times sounds like criticism, to denial about policies 
 of the government. However, frankly, we don't think that this action of the 
 Church has never changed substantially nothing in the policies of 
 governments and also of our government. With all due respect to Pope Francis.

 Where he was unable to be Berlusconi, that is to put his hands on justice and to silence the non -aligned press, now the minister Nordio of the Meloni government is succeeding.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  With this unworthy character, the terms "justice" and "guaranteeism" definitively lose their meaning, which is normal in bourgeois law, of the right to the service of the masters, but with this government it sinks even more in the upheaval of laws, in bending The judiciary to government policy, in putting the bavaglio to the press.
 </p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">
<span style="text-align: left;">
   With the minister 
 Nordio "Justice" means injustice and guarantee me means 
 Warranty of impunity for corrupt.
  </span>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is the end of 
 What the bourgeois call "state of law" is a 
 further step forward in the reactionary transformation of the same 
 bourgeois democracy.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are talking about the transition to the Senate of the Nordio bill that will go to 
 Room, which has passed with
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 a wide
 <span data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-bgimage="">
  majority supported by Italy Viva and Action, the miserable Renzi e 
 Calenda, on the face of the yes (104) and the oppositions on that of the No 
 (56).
 </span>
<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The design of 
 Nordio's law is not a reform of justice but it is one 
 counter -reform, functional to the objectives of the employment plan 
 of the state by this government - the Meloni government - e 
 it once again highlights what classes this government intends 
 protect and what is his design, his conception of what kind of 
 Building company.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After all, it is the 
 line of the entire government that inspires the Nordio bill: on investigations 
 of the judiciary that affect Minister Santanchè the same 
 Meloni said: “A guarantee notice does not determine in 
 the resignation of a minister automatically "
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On Rainews24 - 
 reports Il Fatto Quotidiano - The deputy minister of Forza Italia, 
 Francesco Paolo Sisto, Berlusconi's former lawyer, says that the reform 
 “It has been studied and calibrated over time, with the direct 
 participation "of the man of Arcore, who“ suffered a lot, 
 Too much, because of justice ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The biggest 
 corrupt and corrupter of Italian politics and master caste, 
 linked to great crime - and here are the processes and years 
 of investigations that prove it - is the model for the counter -reform 
 Nordio of justice.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The reason that it 
 he had pushed to his "descent on the pitch" was definitely for 
 defend themselves from the processes, from the amount of investigations that accused him of 
 corruption, of underworld and ties with crime, as well as 
 implement Gelli's Golder Plan to whose Masonic Loggia 
 Berlusconi was registered. This was the forerunner who allowed 
 the settlement of the worst of this political class representing 
 of the worst politics and main caste in our country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 administrators, mayors and political caste at local level e 
 provincial will not be pursued for the crime of abuse of office 
 Because this, art. 323 of the criminal code, with this 
 Counter -reform, it has been abolished. The green light is given to contracts 
 without rules, to dizzying profits for the masters and the destruction of the 
 territories, to the impunity of the assassins for the deaths on 
 Work that contracts without rules will certainly increase.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No punishment for 
 Who takes bribes because the trafficking of influences from Nordio is 
 been reduced to the minimum terms: the public will no longer be punishable 
 official that, by violating the law, "intentionally procures to itself or 
 to others an unfair asset advantage or causes others to 
 unjust damage ". If the text becomes law, Italy will become 
 the only country in the capitalist world in which this conduct does not 
 It constitutes a crime. And this writes a bourgeois newspaper.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Not only. For 
 arrest an alleged corrupt or tangentist (who maybe not even 
 he knew he was investigated) we will have to "warn him" with a 
 at least five days advance that will undergo an interrogation.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Is demolished 
 Art. 21 of the Constitution on the freedom to demonstrate 
 freely one's thoughts and on the freedom of the press, aiming at 
 Hit journalists not aligned with the government and put the gag 
 to the right of news and the law of citizens, of the masses, ad 
 be informed, because the Nordio counter -reform prohibits the 
 publication of interceptions.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<span data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="" data-darkreader-inline-bgimage="">
   The 
 5S Roberto Scarpinato attacks "an anti -democratic system, anti 
 Equilitaria and class ", while Ilaria Cucchi of Alleanza Verdi 
 And left speaks of "an insult to democracy".
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For 
 the opposition, from young people, by environmentalists, from the movements 
 of the political and social opposition, only repression and manganelli, 
 heavier penalties, while impunity is guaranteed to the masters e 
 to corrupt politicians.
 </p>
<p>
  With this 
 counter -reform the minister Nordio not only rehabilitates and legitimizes the 
 worse than that system that newspapers and investigations once 
 they called "tangentopoli", that system produced by the plot 
 Between corrupt masters and corrupters, finance and political class to 
 government on a national and local level, a system that we have below 
 to the eyes every day with arrests and investigations that are hitting the 
 members of the government parties and some of his ministers, but one step 
 further in the demolition/dissolution of this bourgeois state for 
 structure a new one in the service of a regime, that goal 
 that Gelli had proposed with the Renaissance plan of P2 and who with that disaster of Minister Nordio today creates his plan 
 Golder.

 We want to take stock and 
 bring for example our work in the places of 
 work, in factories, between workers and workers, that 
 of the necessary battle, of the link between the support for 
 Palestinian resistance and the battle against the imperialist war, 
 that binds the interests - even immediate - of workers with respect 
 to the international situation.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This work 
 The factories are already taking place within a more activity 
 general to raise consciousness and counter -information in places 
 of work, using what is the tool of the 
 Counter -information.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After October 7th 
 We continually intervened, bringing the mobilizations and i 
 contents of the Palestinian struggle and the solidarity campaign e 
 of movements also in the jobs, we did ours 
 part to inform and make workers participate in this battle 
 which is also fundamental for
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 the defense of working conditions, 
 a defense in the perspective of an attack, with the awareness 
 that only the questioning of the entire system 
 capitalist/imperialist can also make sense of ours 
 everyday claims.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Countryside 
 also started internationally - and that we in Italy have 
 made their own by adhering to the two initiatives of 23 February and 24 
 February launched by the Palestinian organizations, in particular 
 by the young Palestinians of Italy - it is very important and gives us 
 An additional opportunity to make a specific campaign compared to 
 Those who are the links between the genocidal plan of Israel e 
 imperialism and the intervention and the enlargement of the war then, 
 with the direct sending of our troop imperialism in the Mar 
 Red and therefore the battle that binds the struggle of peoples, the 
 resistance to the factories of our imperialist countries, which is the 
 better support for the Palestinian people, their resistance and everyone 
 The martyrs who are resisting the genocide of 
 Israel.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start with it 
 explain that behind the inhumanity of this genocide, of this 
 Destruction campaign towards the Palestinian people, of annihilation 
 of a people, there is the imperialist system, there is the logic of 
 profit and therefore it is up to us, to us workers and communists, explain 
 what is behind this system that generates these genocides 
 in the silence of all powerful imperialist states, while 
 On the other hand, all peoples are lined up alongside the 
 resistance of the Palestinian people, who are increasingly an example - 
 As we have said several times in the interventions to the factories - the 
 Palestine is the example of the peoples who fight, the liberation of the 
 Palestine is the liberation of all the oppressed.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We have to go down 
 in the square with these objectives and link this solidarity to the people 
 Palestinian, to the fight against those who give us none every day 
 Guarantee: workers in factories are not guaranteeing the 
 I work, for students there is no future, it is a school 
 More and more full of war, full of pieces of shit like Crosetto. Also 
 On Israel and Palestine we see that the Meloni government is not a 
 government like the others, it is always a government of the masters but it is a 
 Government of fascists, where Crosetto is the direct exponent 
 of the military industry, and in other governments there is never this 
 state. So it is very similar to what is also going on in 
 Netanyahu government that is marching towards a regime, also firing 
 of the contrary voices there are in that country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We have to 
 bring this campaign and this message that are very important 
 For the unity of the struggle of peoples, of the proletarians: that the proletarians 
 they do not have the home of the capital to defend but have only one 
 world to conquer. And for this reason it is very important to come into 
 field of workers, even if not easy because it is difficult in this atmosphere of 
 permanent campaign, disinformation and attack on dissent, of 
 criminalization, with the repression that also in these days is 
 made more feel.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Our intervention that has been done 
 In front of Rai, in Milan, summarizes this climate which is a 
 sign of weakness by the warfounded government, 
 fascist, of the Meloni who deludes himself that with the repression he can 
 stop the right solidarity and the struggle of peoples and proletarians.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The appeal of 
 23 and 24 binds the importance of solidarity with resistance 
 Palestinian and the fight against the imperialist war and in this 
 sense on the day of the 23rd is a day of strikes that for us wants 
 say assemblies, information, day of struggle organized by 
 basic unions to which the Slai Cobas for the union of 
 class joined. It is a very important day of struggle for 
 bring the right requests of the workers directly 
 Palestinian resistance that want a right peace, a peace with the 
 justice, who want to say enough to the imperialist wars, is enough 
 to the unjust wars, but who know very well that to get everything 
 This must be made a war, the war on the exploiters, the war 
 to Zionists, to the imperialists, the masters of the world, the war on 
 Italian government that is at war against the Palestinian people because 
 just in these days, not only through what are the 
 weapons industries, but also through the direct sending of the soldiers 
 In the Red Sea, he entered the war directly against the Palestinians 
 And therefore against all the proletarians.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This campaign e 
 This activity in the jobs, among the workers, is a lot 
 important because the best help to the Palestinian people is that 
 to hit our government and all its dirty interests that 
 are those of the masters of the multinationals, of the factories of 
 weapons, of Eni. Let's not forget that in front of Palestine there is a 
 Large interest of Eni for oil, for the gas, of a great deposit 
 of the Palestinians who want to be exploited by Israel and his 
 imperialist friends who are not by chance helping Israel and then 
 Shake, also in this case, the booty.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this it is one 
 The resistance that in Yemen is doing the 
 Yemenity people, defined not correctly as "Houthi rebels", 
 But this is a very important thing because it is an intervention 
 direct that affects the interests of the masters, of 
 imperialists and this is the other question that is very important in 
 These two days, to get to strikes, to 
 stops, to position sockets in the factories, which, we know 
 very well, which is a very long job, but it is 
 a necessary work to which this campaign offers the possibility of 
 give continuity.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The event 
 Milan national of 24 from Piazzale Loreto binds the question 
 internationalist to the question of the struggle here in Italy, because, 
 As we also said in other interventions, the resistance in 
 Palestine is the resistance that is also needed here in Italy.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How was it 
 said in the appeals of the Palestinian Associations compared to these 
 Two days what is necessary is to raise the level of the 
 solidarity that is what you need right now. Because like 
 increases this solidarity increases the repression of the police, 
 As in Vicenza, to the events in front of Rai. Now let's see 
 which increasingly increase these attempts to use the truncheon 
 To stop, but on the other hand it tells us that the state, governments, i 
 masters, they are afraid of the peoples who raise their heads, they are afraid 
 of the example that comes from 7 October and which comes from many other struggles 
 like that of the Communist Party of India, of the struggles of 
 National liberation, popular wars against fascism 
 Hindu in India and in many other countries. These struggles, these people's wars must join in a 
 Antimperialist, anti -capitalist front and the liberation struggle 
 of Palestine must find her way to an effective one 
 liberation through international link and solidarity e 
 internationalist with the organizations that direct these 
 Resistances.

   Writing Note:
  </strong>
  Below is a note published by the portal Article 19 on the recent prison and political persecution launched against protesters of São Paulo arrested in a demonstration against the fare and accused of "attempted abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law."
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
  The year 2024 began with challenges with regard to the protection of the right to protest. On 01/10, it was organized in the center of São Paulo act against the increase of public transport tariffs, when 25 young people, including teenagers, were detained by the Military Police on the departure of Republic of Metro Station. On 01/18, in the second act summoned with the same agenda, 7 people were arrested, including lawyers identified with vests from the OAB Human Rights Commission (Brazilian Bar Association).
 </p>
<p>
  Since the end of 2023, protesters have faced the resumption and strengthening of techniques of restriction to the right to protest, especially from the truculence of the police forces of the State of São Paulo. We remember here the demonstration against the privatization of Sabesp (São Paulo State Basic Sanitation Company), which occurred in December last year at the São Paulo State Legislative Assembly (Alesp), when protesters were brutally assaulted by the Military Police of State of Sao Paulo.
  <sup class="fn" data-fn="22a078c8-f9f1-408e-9db3-26902edf0410">
<a href="#22a078c8-f9f1-408e-9db3-26902edf0410" id="22a078c8-f9f1-408e-9db3-26902edf0410-link">

</p>
<p>
  In addition to truculent actions and violence against protesters, other irregularities and ways to inhibit protests have stood out. An example is the justification of military police to perform approaches during the demonstrations against increasing the passage claiming that young people would be wearing black blouses, masks and backpacks, which would characterize, in the eyes of these security agents, the Black Bloc tactic, point of justifying a “preventive” investigation.
 </p>
<p>
  Another element of attention is the typification proposed by police forces and members of the São Paulo prosecutor: criminal association and attempt to abolish the Democratic Rule of Law. The crime of criminal association, instituted through Law 12.850/2013, has been systematically used for this purpose since 2013, when manifestations that initially had the central agenda the repudiation of the increase in public transportation also took to the streets of the country . The greatest example is the arrest and conviction of 23 people in Rio de Janeiro, after participation in protests between 2013 and 2014.
  <strong>

<sup class="fn" data-fn="f86681e4-e8c8-4128-bb72-7c4795c00a6d">
<a href="#f86681e4-e8c8-4128-bb72-7c4795c00a6d" id="f86681e4-e8c8-4128-bb72-7c4795c00a6d-link">

</p>
<p>
  The crime of attempted abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law is more recent: it is incorporated into the Brazilian legal system in 2021, in the Package of Democratic Rule Protection Devices (Law 14.197/21), also elaborated for the purpose of revoking the National Security Law (Law 7.170/83). The latter, dating from the military regime in mid-2021, was being widely mobilized by the Bolsonaro government to criminalize and inhibit the criticism of dissident voices, criticizing the management of the Covid-19 pandemic associating the then president with genocide.
  <strong>
</strong>
<sup class="fn" data-fn="389ff284-68f3-4590-b16d-456207b45de8">
<a href="#389ff284-68f3-4590-b16d-456207b45de8" id="389ff284-68f3-4590-b16d-456207b45de8-link">

   </a>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
  At that moment we warned of the risks of these new typifications for social movements and people exercising the right to protest. Therefore, even during the processing of the legislature, it was included a device that prohibited the application of this law in cases of “critical manifestation to constitutional powers or the journalistic activity or the claim of constitutional rights and guarantees through gadgets, meetings, strikes , of agglomerations or any other form of political manifestation for social purposes ”. This article, however, was vetoed by then -President Jair Bolsonaro.
 </p>
<p>
  If there is no safeguard for this application, we find ourselves in the scenario in which people exercising their fundamental and human right to demonstration are accused of trying to abolish the Democratic Rule of Law. The arguments for this are fragile: After all, like a few dozen or hundreds of people, gathered by protesting on matters of local and public interest, without planning or attempting to injure the physical integrity of third parties, could they be trying to practice this act?
 </p>
<p>
  In this sense, it is noteworthy that neither the posting of content that encourages participation in protests, or reporting ways of defending themselves from police violence at these times, nor the use of “clothing in black”, “masks”, hoods or “backpacks ”They are sufficient to infer that these people would come to commit violence, crimes or even to make against the Democratic Rule of Law - contrary to what police arrest police say in the act, by justifying preventive repressive action. Even with these latent impossibilities, there are legal operators endorsing the narrative of police forces. And in this wake, people on the streets for the claim of rights have been criminalized and stigmatized.
 </p>
<p>
  A
  <strong>
   Article 19
  </strong>
  expressed profound concern for this context. This is because, more than 10 years after the episodes of extreme police violence and criminalization of protesters during and after June 2013, we see the repetition of inhibition techniques of people who defend and claim rights, plus new elements that allow these violations of rights. It is necessary for the public power - and, in particular, the public security forces and the judiciary - to be aware of the improper application of the mentioned predictions, avoiding restricting human and fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression, manifestation, meeting and protest.

<b>
     Appeal of the Eastern Office of the IC against imperialism and Zionism in Palestine
    </b>
<b>
     (February 1925)
    </b>
</h2>
<p>
    The English imperialists and Zionist colonizers have again 
 The revolutionary avant -garde of the workers and peasants of the 
 Palestine.
   </p>
<p>
    Dictatorial master of Egypt and Sudan, English imperialism 
 He wants to eradicate the Palestinian revolutionary and national movement. For 
  maintain "order" and tranquility in the Suez region, 
 England has started a furious repression campaign in 
 Palestine. The local bourgeoisie and the Zionist settlers carry out for her i 
 lower services.
   </p>
<p>
    Remembling Zionism, English imperialism tries to break the 
 National emancipation of the Arabs. The Israelite bourgeoisie 
 Zionist gets, in reward for his good and loyal services, the 
 privilege of "dominant nation", while the population of Palestine 
  It includes only 13% of Jews. Using this privilege, 
 protected by machine guns and English planes, the organization 
 Zionist strives to remove the land from the Arab farmers. Ally e 
 accomplice of
    <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
   oppressors, the rich Arab feudal aristocracy - the 
 "Effendi" - willingly sells its lands to Jewish capitalists, without 
 take care of the fate of the Arab farmers who cultivate from 
 Dozens of these properties.
   <p>
</p>
<span id="more-26656">
</span>
<p>
    Every day, from the beginning of the Zionist colonization, of 
 Arabic growers are driven out of their lands. They are painful 
 Conflicts between Jewish settlers and small Arab farmers.
   </p>
<p>
    Each piece of land purchased by Zionist colonizers is taken to 
 price of the ruin of hundreds of Arab families. The English government 
 knows well how to exploit the national antagonism that arises from these 
 abuse. Exciting the Arabs against the Jews and the Jews against the 
 Arabs, English imperialism then presents itself in the part of referee, of 
  "Protector of peaceful populations". One way like any other for 
 justify its domination.
   </p>
<p>
    The coalition of English imperialism, Jewish Zionism and of 
  Arabic feudalism to exploit the proletariat and the peasants in common 
 In Palestine, he found a devoted auxiliary in the Socialist Party 
 Achduct Kavoda of Palestine, section of the second international. This 
  "Socialist party" encourages the ignominious task that the settlers 
 Zionists call the "holy conquest of the earth", of the land of 
 Arab farmers. The Jewish workers, sadly unconscious, who follow 
 Achdu Kavoda kill each other with the
    <i>
     fellah
    </i>
    Arabs; The Zionists and the effendes are enriched.
   </p>
<p>
    The ruthless expropriation of
    <i>
     fellah
    </i>
    ruined before 
 be brutally driven out of their outbreaks, misery, penalty and the 
 hunger for the Jewish and Arabs workers, cynically exploited by the bourgeoisie 
 Jewish and from the Arab nobility, they give birth to deaf riots among the 
 Palestine workers.
   </p>
<p>
    The events of Afula [a town in northern Palestine - n.], Where 
 The blood of the Arab farmers and the Jewish colonists is last in one 
 battle for the earth, they proposed on the agenda the 
 Malopte of the Anglo-subjerable colonizers.
   </p>
<p>
    Palestine Communist Party condemns hypocrisy and infamy 
 of the British oppressors and their Zionist vassals. The party 
 Communist of Palestine condemns the miserable "socialists" of thechdu 
 Kavoda and the "yellow" managers of the Histadrut union.
   </p>
<p>
    The Communist Party wants the organization of workers 
 Palestinians, Arabs and Jews, without distinction of nationality, and the 
 establishment of union federations united on a struggle platform 
 class. Palestine Communists resist the formation of a 
 privileged Zionist caste, susceptible to come one day 
 thrown against the workers and defenseless Arab farmers.
    <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
    So all the reactionary forces of the country, from the English police to the socialists, declared war on our party.
   </p>
<p>
    The bands of the Zionist fascism are seen to attack and massacre the 
 Revolutionary workers. The workers' circles are closed. The arrests yes 
 multiply.
   </p>
<p>
    Workers' companions! Require the liberation of the arrested revolutionaries! 
 Demand the liberation of all political prisoners and all 
 Arab nationalists fighting against the Anglo-Sionist oppression!
   </p>
<p>
    I lower the white terror!
   </p>
<p>
    Long live the Communist Party of Palestine!
   </p>
<p>
    Long live the fraternal and revolutionary union of the exploited Arab and Jews!

<p>
  In each new “party of democracy” revisionism tries to convince the Galician proletariat that the Spanish Regime is a neutral instrument, that it is not the enemy of the Galician people. Revisionism tries to hide that the Spanish Regime is the instrument of the alliance between the Galician bourgeoisie and the Spanish bourgeoisie, in addition to other allied secondary classes and social strata, such as the clergy, sectors without class consciousness, etc.
 </p>
<p>
  The political practice of revisionism always strengthens the bourgeois State because it always keeps alive the idea that through elections, institutions and reforms of the bourgeois State it is possible to eliminate the destructive character of capitalist society, or that it is possible to eliminate the tendency for new inter-imperialist wars, that it is possible to eliminate the Law of Capitalist Accumulation which determines that the increase in the wealth of a few people implies the poverty of many other people in the world, or that it is possible to regulate the maximum differences between the income of the bourgeoisie and the salary of the working class through taxes, etc.
 </p>
<p>
  Revisionism always tries to “save” the working class from its “disillusionment” in the bourgeois State. Even when revisionism calls for “abstention” it is always because “none of the options is adequate”. Even though revisionism calls for “abstention”, it unconsciously wants to make it clear that it does not want to consider the bourgeois State as the enemy, that it does not want to combat false illusions in the reform of the bourgeois State.
 </p>
<p>
  Other revisionists will choose, as on other occasions, to remain silent about the parliamentary farce. For many, there is always the “less bad” option. A less evil that never ends, because there is always something worse but it is the “least evil” in the face of the new, even more evil element.
 </p>
<p>
  For revisionism, elections are the eternal process of “accumulation of forces”. An eternal “accumulation of forces” that never ends and that only serves to “accumulate” the common meaning of bourgeois ideology. An “accumulation of forces” that justifies everything but is of no use if we want a “guide to action”.
 </p>
<p>
  In the current situation of the Galician proletariat, where there is no communist party that creates links that unite the vanguard and the masses, any other political position other than boycott means giving up fighting bourgeois ideology. It means deviating from the just political line. Because renouncing to uncover and denounce the class character of the state is to contribute to spreading bourgeois ideology. So much so that revisionism talks a lot about trade unionism, anti-fascism, socialism, communism, etc., because its program and practice only serve to justify some workerist, or postmodern, version of bourgeois ideology.
 </p>
<p>
  Uncovering the class character of the Spanish Regime as the political power of the Galician bourgeoisie in alliance with the Spanish bourgeoisie and as much as the main enemy of the Galician people is fundamental in the work of communist agitation. Without becoming aware of the class character of the Spanish Regime, it is impossible to be aware of the social reality of the world.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Boycott the electoral farce!
  </strong>

<p>
  On February 11, Europe’s largest Nazi march, the so-called “Day of Honor”, once again took place in Budapest. Last year, there were attacks on participating fascists. There was repression in several countries against allegedly participating anti-fascists. Let’s take a look at the current situation.
 </p>
<p>
  On January 29,
  <a href="https://taz.de/Urteil-gegen-deutschen-Autonomen/!5988475/">
   the first verdict was handed down
  </a>
  in the trial against anti-fascists who opposed the annual Nazi march in the Hungarian capital Budapest last year. The verdict was against Tobias E., a German antifascist from Berlin. He stood trial together with two other defendants. The Italian anti-fascist Ilaria S. and the anti-fascist Anna M., also from Germany.
 </p>
<p>
  The defendants were originally accused of carrying out attacks on fascists on the fringes of the so-called “Day of Honor”. However, as there is probably no evidence, the accusation of having directly committed a violent crime against the fascists was dropped against the two German anti-fascists. Instead, the public prosecutor’s office, accused them, with a clear political will to judge, to be member of a criminal organization. Tobias confessed to this accusation at the last trial, whereupon he was sentenced to three years in prison.
 </p>
<p>
  Tobias and Ilaria have been in pre-trial detention in Hungary for around a year, where they have also been subjected to torture in the form of solitary confinement, physical violence and other harassment by the prison guards. While the two Germans are not accused of any direct involvement in violent crimes, the situation is different for Ilaria. In addition to membership of the criminal organization, she is also accused of “three attempted life-threatening bodily injuries”, which means she faces maybe a prison sentence of up to 24 years
 </p>
<p>
  However, the three defendants are not the only defendants in this trial. In addition to them, the Hungarian public prosecutor’s office is also searching for 14 other people, including ten Germans, who are wanted on European arrest warrants. The German authorities, for their part, are making every effort to work hand in hand with the Hungarian public prosecutor’s office against the anti-fascists. In this sense, there have been numerous actions by the reaction. From house searches, public manhunt to a medial propaganda campaign. In December last year, these actions proved successful. The anti-fascist Maja was arrested by a special unit in a Berlin hotel, where she was thrown through a glass door and was injured by this. But even though the reaction succeeded in arresting one person, there are still nine German anti-fascists that the political police cannot find. And these are only those who are being targeted because of the actions in Hungary.
 </p>
<p>
  The imprisoned anti-fascist Maja and the nine other Germans, If they are caught, face not only imprisonment in Germany, but also extradition to Hungary and thus years or even decades in prison under Hungarian detention conditions. In addition to being far away from their families and friends, this also means, as their lawyers and various human rights NGOs put it, inhumane prison conditions. The anti-fascists which detained there have already reported being locked up for 23 hours a day, being denied contact with relatives for months on end, suffer under malnutrition, having vermin such as cockroaches, mice and bedbugs in their cells, inadequate ventilation in summer and no heating in winter. In addition, there is then the physical violence and daily harassment by the guards too.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not only the lawyers and comrades of the accused, who are resisting the possible extradition of Maja and the other anti-fascists. Also their families fight too. For example, the parents of the accused
  <a href="https://de.indymedia.org/node/336607">
   published a letter
  </a>
  which opposing the extradition to Hungary and the media smear campaign against their children.
 </p>
<p>
  The fact that the possibility of extraction for the anti-fascists still exists shows impressively how much the FRG actually values its frequently propagated human rights. Ultimately, the policy of the German state does not depend on any “European values”, but rather on political calculation. The antifascist forces must together resolutely resist against the state attacks that are taking place in this context.

  Mao Tse-Tung in the speech before the National Conference of the Party

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5aacf3cbdd62c3a584c063a1852b7e71">
  The heroic Palestinian national resistance, which has been fighting decades against the Zionist invader (faithful agents of Yankee imperialism), gave a strong blow to the table when on October 7 began the operation "The Flood of Al-Aqsa". Months later, the fighting continues and the state of Israel does not see an exit where it comes out as victorious. Moreover, militias and guerrillas from all over the region (such as the hutis, in Yemen) are launching attacks against Yankee and Allied military objectives.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b23b5f8811e968b9c1ca9b906ebb87c7">
  Contrary to what the bourgeois media said, directly or indirectly, Palestine has not surrendered. The state of Israel has not defeated. The war, concentrated in the Gaza Strip, which is nothing more than a few kilometers, has shown that the people, and only the people, is the motor force of history. A small nation, only with the strength of his people, is planting one of the most prepared professional armies in history. Not even the famous iron dome was able to stop the Palestinian Embite those days of October. Palestinian national resistance demonstrates that the force of the masses can knock down imperialism, and are doing it.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-11169c08e4973d73d68f7e248aaa9f86">
<strong>
   Imperialism is a paper tiger
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7432f5760c58cb1d90a9e3152e10dec7">
  President Mao Tse-Tung said that Imperialists, however strong they seem, are weak in the long term. He pointed out that they are "paper tigers with mud feet", making the metafora that are strong in principle (strong feet), but very weak in the long term (paper body) because they cannot bear the organization, anger and struggles of the town by a long time sustained over time. Said the following:
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ba52797b1b56a971813abe0f810ea5a3">
  “I have said that all reactionaries, held by strong, are nothing more than paper tigers. The reason is that they live divorced from the people. Look! Wasn't Hitler a paper tiger? Wasn't it knocked down? I also said that the Tsar of Russia, the emperor of China and Japanese imperialism were all paper tigers. As you know, they have all been shot down. American imperialism has not yet been shot down and has the atomic bomb. I am sure that it will also be shot down. It is also a paper tiger "
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-86b2d1a2b0239bd629b0c5813f07b6af">
<strong>
   Faced with the "critical support" of opportunists, which is nothing more than imperialist chauvinism, we must support the Palestinian cause without reservations
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2fdd0f30a44feac6fa022d254c4e39f7">
  The progressive revolutionaries and Democrats of the world must support without reservations to the heroic Palestinian national resistance. It is especially important when we speak "without reservations", since sometimes it falls into the imperialist chauvinism of opportunists and all kinds of reactionaries who disguise themselves from the left. These false friends of the Palestinian people claim to support national resistance, but with facts, betray it and passively collaborate with the story of the bourgeois media.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5d539d4a178781cec62b4eaecd330394">
  They say: "Support for Palestinian resistance, but not Hamas" or "Support for secular Palestinian resistance, but not Islamic." Do Palestinian national resistance form more groups in addition to Hamas? Of course. Is Hamas who currently leads her? Obviously, it is so. Therefore, those who do not defend the war actions of the Palestinian militias for "not supporting the Islamism of Hamas" from their lay imperialist and "left -wing" chauvinism, really what he is doing is to deny the direction of the Palestinian resistance, he is denying all the actions that until now are carrying out. The flood of Al-Aqsa is denying the entire operation. What kind of "critical support" is that!?
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-911f4677d0749cb3fc0e2bfa7aa6f726">
  We talk about the national liberation struggle of an oppressed people against imperialism; of an oppressed nation to be more exact. Of course, the National Liberation Movement, by its own essence, encompasses the elements of the nation that wants to free itself from the invading yoke. And the nation is formed by classes and elements of all kinds. In this sense, it is normal for different classes and ideologies to live within national resistance.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e3fe6b8d5e38dfb4a7cbff7159993eda">
  The position of the "critical support", which while denies most of the actions of the National Liberation War of Palestine (and therefore, deny the liberation itself in the facts), aims to help in some way the construction of the construction of the Socialism in Palestine, is entirely absurd and far from the reality of the class struggle.

  In the second half of the 1970s, especially in London and New York City, the punk rock scene grew up and produced two internationally successful bands in the British capital with the sex Pistols and The Clash. The punk scene grew up in the context of the rise of the fascist "British National Party", reflected the rebellion of young people against the monarchist authorities and fascist elements in the United Kingdom; Nevertheless, the scene was repeatedly hiked by fascist elements, which hiked brawls at concerts of bands with progressive songs such as Sham 69.

  The sex pistols were particularly known with the two songs "God Save the Queen" and "Anarchy in the U.K.". Her “protest” also included the obvious wearing of fascist symbols such as swastika t-shirts; But her songs were better, like the parody of the British national anthem:

  Many of the advanced bands were part of the "Rock Against Racism" concert series, which was directed against British pop stars, among other things, who drew attention to themselves with evil reactionary headlines, as Eric Clapton ("Keep Britain White!") Or or David Bowie (expressed his support for fascism and his admiration for Hitler in interviews with the "Playboy", among others). Also in the FRG there was quickly a counterpart to "Rock Against Racism" with "Rock against Right", which-from the communist federal government-was not yet such a bourgeois-democratic meaning. In these actions in England, however, it can also be kept in mind that many activities against the British National Party and their influence of leadership of the Trotskyists were subject to.

  The Clash - also part of "Rock Against Racism" - landed their biggest hits with "London Calling" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go", but also had far more political and combative numbers. In 1979 - before the London workers' part of the London was actually an uprising against the police - the song "Guns of Brixton" was released, which deals with the situation of a son of Jamaican immigrants in the quarter, which between police force and the consequences of the Economic crisis grows up. In keeping with this, “Guns of Brixton” already consists largely of elements of the rocksteady / reggae, which at that time became popular by the migrants in England. However, only a few black bands were commercially successful, most likely to be called the song "Pass the Dutchie" from the musical Youth, 1982. In 1979 the label 2 Tone Records was founded, under which the Ska - Sprover of Rocksteady and Reggae in Jamaica - a revival in the United Kingdom experienced, where mainly white bands like "Madness" made a name for itself with their cover version of "One Step Beyond", "The Specials" or "The Beat". In addition to these groups, the fusion of elements of the SKA and the skinhead scene also found their expression in “2 tone”, the best-known example was the “Bad Manners”. Among the most advanced known "2 tone" songs are:

  "Rock Against Racism" and "2 Tone" musicians like Elvis Costello also had an important influence on later left folk singers such as Billy Bragg, who started his music career in 1981 after he had bought up from the British Army for £ 175, and end the 80s and early 90s had some successes.

  Today, Saturday 17/2 in the city center, there was a solidarity demonstration of the Palestinian people and based on the very serious developments in Rafa. 
 Student clubs and left -wing organizations in the city participated.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The call came from the processes of student associations and the direction that puts the need to express solidarity with the people of the city on the road, not by collecting food or road racing that do not give a substantial response as proposed by the KKE forces.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On the basis of this necessity, it was also called by the KKE (M-L) and a meeting was held in the past few days for the existence of the rally and its fulfillment with the most massive conditions.

The CC, CPI (Maoist) conveys its <br/>hearty revolutionary greetings to all the well -wishers, friends and supporters of In dian Revolution <br/>abroad who rendered their great contribution in propagating the Indian State‟s encirclement and <br/>annihilate military campaigns against the Indian Revolution and help advance it with the utmost <br/>steadfastness, revolutionary zeal and spirit.  <br/>Our Party is  retaliating the „Reactionary Surajkund Strategic Offensive Plan‟ since last one <br/>year with great sacrifices and contributions of Indian toiling masses and well -wishers, friends, <br/>supporters of Indian People‟s Democratic Revolution and gaining new achievements. It is <br/>advancing the New Democratic Revolution in semi -colonial, semi -feudal India in the path of <br/>Protracted People‟s War with the aim of establishing Socialism -Communism all over the world.  <br/>This is a brief report of the important aspects our Party‟s efforts in the Ideological -Political, <br/>Military and United Front including Cultural front of CPI (Maoist) during the past one year for <br/>friends and comrades of Indian Revolution abroad.  <br/>Firstly we pay humble revolutionary homage to all the martyrs an d heroes who  shed their <br/>blood for the cause of Indian Revolution. Our party met with a great loss of a member of the Polit <br/>Bureau of the Central Committee Comrade Katakam Sudarshan apart from another 78 comrades. <br/>Nearly 20 of the martyrs are woman comrades . The entire Party, PLGA red warriors, United Fronts <br/>and revolutionary masses conveys its red salute to those brave hearts who sacrificed their lives <br/>from the liberation of the masses from the shackles of semi -colonialism and semi -feudalism. We <br/>pledge to t ake forth their ideals.  <br/>We hail the great revolutionary determination of our comrades, members of the CC <br/>Comrades Jaspal, Mohit, Janardhan (PBM) and Mangtu and hundreds of activists of the Party, <br/>PLGA, RPC and RMOs who are in the dungeons of Indian State a nd reiterate that we would take <br/>forth the efforts for their unconditional release.  <br/>International situation  <br/>The year 2023 was one more year of the intensification of Imperialist crisis and inter-<br/>Imperialist wars on oppressed nations and oppressed people in a bid to redivide the world for loot <br/>of land, natural resources and labour power . The Zionist Israeli state highly intensified  its bloody <br/>war on Palestine making  genocide with the backing of US Imperialism together  with its western <br/>imperialist alliances. N evertheless it could not defile the aspirations of the heroic Palestinians with <br/>the great solidarity of world people.  <br/>The last 22 months of uninterrupted US -Russia bloody proxy war in Ukraine has entered the <br/>year 2024 with the cost of hundreds of people‟s lives. 2023 was the year of strikes against the loot <br/><br/><br/>and exploitation of capitalist system and its war mongering. US declared it year of Strikes. In the <br/>semi colonial semi feudal countries India, Philippines, Turkey, Peru, Afghanistan and Brazil where <br/>New Democratic Revolution with socialist perspective is marching forward under the banner of <br/>Marxism -Leninism -Maoism. The revolutionary movement went through  gruesome repression by <br/>the reactionary governments with the support of Imperialism, mainly US Imperial ism. <br/>In the background of the intensification of the general crisis of capitalism there are <br/>considerable changes in world politics. US hegemony over the world has suffered a setback and it <br/>is no longer a super power in t he multipolar world. However, US continues to be the Number One <br/>enemy of the people of the world. Global capitalist system is in a state of generalized and <br/>protracted stagnation and decline. Presently, intense mass unemployment, homelessness, <br/>inflation, ra cism and fascism characterize the Imperialist countries. Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, <br/>Nanotech, Biotech technologies are leading to retrenchment of lakh of toilers, employees and <br/>technicians and to employment less growth in developed and developing c ountries.  <br/>There is collusion and contention between the Imperialist powers but contention is the main <br/>and primary. Trade wars between Imperialist powers reached a new height especially in semi -<br/>conductor commodities that is popularly known as „chip war‟ bet ween US and China.  The US is <br/>steadily increasing its military presence in Asia.  It is handing over large numbers of deadly <br/>weapons to Philippines and Taiwan in opposition to China. China is utilizing the G -77 alliance of <br/>the most backward countries for i ts interests of world hegemony. US has now based Nuclear -<br/>capable B -52s in Darwin (Australia) and in Guam in order to target China and maintain its <br/>hegemony over the Pacific Ocean. The situation is increasing the danger of World War III.  <br/>We have been witnes sing a spate of anti -imperialist struggles in the backward countries and <br/>a spate of working class struggles in capitalist -imperialist countries all over the world. The <br/>sharpening fundamental contradictions at the international level are – 1. The contradict ion between <br/>imperialism and oppressed nationalities and people 2. The contradiction between bourgeoisie and <br/>proletariat in capitalist, imperialist countries 3. The contradictions among imperialist countries and <br/>among monopoly capitalist groups. The contrad iction between imperialism and oppressed <br/>nationalities and people is the main contradiction. These developments show that in 2024, the <br/>situation would be more favourable for revolution.  <br/>Domestic Situation  <br/>India is deeply impacted by the intensification of contradictions between Imperialist powers <br/>and other contradictions at the international arena.  In this situation the major contradictions of <br/>India are also intensifying. US Imperialism utilized G -20 and e specially India‟s Presidentship to <br/>further its interests. Lakh of crore were spent for the G -20 meeting at the cost of decline in the <br/>economy of the country.  During his tenure, Modi is playing the role of a salesman in inviting <br/>Finance Capital from MNCs i nto the country.  <br/>India‟s accession to the US -led Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) is bound to create a <br/>conducive environment for establishment of Special Export Zones of raw materials in a large scale <br/>to G-7 countries. Just after few days of this deal, Indian government under BJP rule has amended <br/>Environmental laws and Minerals Acts to facilitate the loot and plunder. Indian ruling classes are <br/>lackeys in the hands of the Imperialist countries. Currently, India is one of the largest importers of <br/>arms and weapons in the world and is also bound to increase its arms exports to Asian and African <br/>countries by 5 billion dollars annually by 2025 with the help of US. It is a fact that most of this goes <br/>to the MNCs.  <br/>In the name of ease of doing business, the fascis t BJP government is making amendments <br/>to several laws and abolishing the earlier laws, few of which were achieved through people‟s <br/>struggles in the interests of domestic and foreign corporate companies. Corporatization and <br/>Militarization is the trend in th e last one year of Modi‟s rule. The government took a drive for hyper <br/>privatization of national resources and productive forces to provide  excessive  profits to Comprador <br/>capitalist class and Imperialist powers. India is witnessing an unprecedented liveliho od crisis in its <br/>history.  <br/><br/><br/>The central government repeatedly states that India is going to become the third largest <br/>economy in the world at 5 trillion dollars. But its announcement to provide 5 kgs. of rice per month <br/>to 80 crore people reveals the reality o f the rising inequality in its rule. The growth being boasted <br/>by Modi is only corporate and jobless growth, the three major sectors of the economy i.e. <br/>Agriculture, Industry and Service being corporatized. The growth without improvement in the living <br/>stand ards of the toiling classes is nothing but sham. While speaking of corruption free India, Modi <br/>is in fact helping the Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeoisie such as Adani and Ambani to increase <br/>their wealth. Adani was given a clasped hand to overcome the effec t of Hindenburg report on his <br/>empire of wealth.  <br/>Agricultural sector on which 60 percent of the Indian population remain dependent is in a <br/>dire situation. Cost of production in agriculture has skyrocketed by 20 percent in the past one year. <br/>The income of sm all and medium farmers has a miniscule increase of 2 percent. Real Wages of <br/>the agricultural labourer that comprises 15 crore labour force further declined. According to new <br/>wage  codes the minimum wages of workers is fixed at Rs. 178 per day that is an all -time low. <br/>Unemployment among the educated youth is at all -time high.  <br/>India is moving towards a fascist state at a rapid pace under the regime of Brahmanic <br/>Hindutva fascism since the last 10 years. There is an unprecedented rise in exploitation and <br/>oppress ion on the proletariat, semi -proletariat and the peasantry. The struggles of workers, <br/>farmers and students are being  suppressed in fascist manner . There are increasing attacks and <br/>military suppression on the struggle for national liberation of the people of Kashmir. The Supreme <br/>Court of India passed judgment in favour of annulment of Article 370 A and asserted the <br/>nullification of the nominal status of a special state to Kashmir. Religious thinking and religious <br/>frenzy are introduced into politics  to sprea d communal hatred in the people.  <br/>Modi‟s rule turned absolutely bureaucratic involving violence and deception together and<br/>continuously. This turned to be daily gimmicks of the government. Attacks on Muslims, Christians, <br/>Dalit, tribal, women, students, you th and all other oppressed people and sections has surmounted <br/>and they are being consigned to second -class citizen in their own mother land. The criminal <br/>elements in the BJP are encouraged to unleash all kinds of inhuman, cruel deeds on the people of <br/>the c ountry.  <br/>Nearly half of the MPs of BJP are involved in criminal cases related to women, one of them <br/>being the infamous President of Wrestling Federation of India (WFI). The world witnessed how the <br/>police manhandled the woman wrestlers who achieved great fam e to the country, on their way to <br/>the new Parliament building on the day when Modi was involved in its inauguration in the outdated <br/>mode of Hindutva rituals. In a series of developments, three wrestlers expressed their strong <br/>dissent to the government. The  atrocities committed on the Kuki -Zoma tribal people of the North <br/>Eastern state of Manipur is another clear and recent example. Bulldozer has become the symbol of <br/>nationalism under the fascist BJP rule and especially in states of double -engine government <br/>(states under BJP rule). Unable to cope up with the situation there is a rise in suicides in these <br/>sections.  <br/>Crore of rupees are spent on building Hindu temples, mainly Ram mandir instead on <br/>education, health and other such basic needs of the people of the country. The aim of these <br/>activities is to instigate religious fundamentalism in various forms in a bid to  divide the people on <br/>religious lines . It is meant to take them back to the medieval times and shed them of their scientific <br/>and secular ideas as true  citizens of the country. The BJP government brought several draconian <br/>laws like new three criminal laws and Data Protection bill to curb the dissent and the revolutionary, <br/>democratic voices of the country.  <br/>The BJP government wants all its ill deeds go unq uestioned and continue its oppressive <br/>governance. The suspension of 146 Parliament Members of the opposition parties in the recent <br/>session  of Parliament  is a clear example of Modi government‟s autocracy. The policies of BJP <br/>reveal that it does not respect even the nominal federal, democratic aspects of bourgeois <br/>democracy. However, the „INDIA‟ alliance is no exception. Whichever the party is, the ruling <br/>classes of India possess Brahmanic Hindutva ideology. In this situation, workers, students, youth <br/>and wom en are taking up militant struggles to live a normal life.  <br/><br/><br/>In this international and domestic situation, the fundamental contradictions in the country <br/>namely - 1. The contradiction between imperialism and the Indian people; 2. The contradiction <br/>between feu dalism and the broad masses; 3. The contradiction between capital and labour; 4. The <br/>internal contradictions among the ruling classes – are further intensifying creating favourable <br/>conditions for revolution.  <br/>The reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive pl an <br/>The BJP works under the dictates of the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS) in order to <br/>take forth its agenda of Brahmanic Hindutva, the establishment of a Hindu state in the country. <br/>Putting together all the ongoing repressive measures, it reviewed in 2 023 December the <br/>reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive plan that it brought forth in the end of October 2022. The <br/>Prime Minister personally attended the meeting that was stated to have discussed about Left -Wing <br/>Extremism (LWE) as they call it, cyber -crime and terrorism.  <br/>The main objective of the offensive plan is to eliminate the Party, PLGA and the organs of <br/>people‟s organisation, Revolutionary People‟s Committees and the entire revolutionary movement. <br/>The state apparatus of Central and State governments was made more im petuous “by deploying <br/>police, Para -military, Commando, Military and Airforce in a big scale in the areas of revolutionary <br/>movement, extension and strengthening of carpet security”. There were aerial strikes on <br/>revolutionary masses and leadership of the par ty. There is massive war of negative propaganda  with <br/>the help of corporate media against not only the revolutionary movement but on each and every <br/>voice of dissent. Intellectuals, Writers, Poets, Human Rights activists, Students, Tribal activists, <br/>Trade Un ion leaders, farmer leaders and all progressive forces are being targeted through this <br/>policy in the name “pen -yielding” Maoists.  <br/>Surajkund policy is crucial for the BJP to win the General Election in 2024 and to fulfill its <br/>design to make India into a cou ntry of Brahmanic Hindutva. The government is intensifying various <br/>reform programs in the name of „development‟ in Maoist areas, Kashmir and the North East.  <br/>Instead of developing cordial relations with the neighbouring countries, Modi's government  is  <br/>strengthening border security and coastal security  and heightening the war like  tensions with the<br/>neighbouring countries . In the light of 2024 General election, it is launching various repressive <br/>campaigns in Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtr a, West Bengal, Keralam and so <br/>on. It is putting an iron heel on the struggling oppressed sections in all states of the country. <br/>Intense and unceasing campaigns are being unleashed in the Special Areas, Guerrilla Zones and <br/>Guerrilla Bases and areas of revo lutionary movement. The government stipulated a time period of <br/>2 years initially and had been continuously extending it, the recent one being 5 years. Presently it <br/>decided to launch “Operation Kagaar” to encircle the area of Maad.  <br/>Now let us look at some o f our efforts comprising ideological - political, military, <br/>organisational spheres and in United Front.  <br/>Ideological -Political Work  <br/>The party took up varied tasks centralizing the main task of overcoming the temporary <br/>setback in the revolutionary movement at  the all India level.  <br/>1. The document on „Changes in Relations of Production in India -Our Political Program‟ <br/>released by the CC was taken among the entire ranks of the party as an educational campaign. <br/>This is being followed by an in -depth understanding of  the situation in the respective areas and <br/>adopting corresponding tactics.  <br/>2. A campaign was launched for two years and a Key paper released on the occasion in <br/>October in order to fight back Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism. The paper highlights the concrete <br/>conditions that led to the emergence RSS in the year 1925, its role in the freedom struggle and its <br/>rise to political power in the year 2014. The essential features of Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism <br/>have been made out in the key paper.  Theoretical analysis h as been done on the issue of religion <br/>and Indian society from Marxist perspective. The  paper defines Indian fascism as “comprador <br/>bureaucratic, feudal fascism”. In order to combat Hindutva fascism, our party framed a program. <br/>The campaign shall be a large scale propaganda and agitation in the coming two years against the <br/>theoretical ideology of the Sangh Parivar, its politics and its fascist practice and attacks, by <br/><br/><br/>mobilizing the vast revolutionary, democratic, secular, patriotic forces and oppressed peopl e so as <br/>to politically isolate and defeat it and contribute to advance the New Democratic Revolutionary <br/>movement.  <br/>3. Our Party participated in the seminar through sending a Paper to the seminar held  on <br/>„Imperialism and War ‟ conducted by NDFP in mid -October  last year  in a European country. T he <br/>seminar paper based on the analysis of imperialism made by the great Marxist teacher Comrade <br/>Lenin. It stated that  the present situation shows the intensification of the  fundamental <br/>contradictions of capitalism in the era of imperialism.  The paper wrote about the earlier World <br/>Wars and analysed the present situation of looming danger of another World War. It wrote about <br/>its understanding provided by Comrade Lenin that the world proletariat must fight to end imperialist  <br/>war and in case it starts, must take up the task of „transforming the war into a civil war‟. It ended <br/>with the quote of the great Marxist teacher Comrade Mao that the present trend in the world is of <br/>Revolution.  <br/>4. It issued a Joint Statement on Russia -Ukraine war and a joint declaration on the occasion <br/>of the 130th Birth Anniversary of Comrade Mao.  <br/>5. It issued a statement and a video on the occasion of the 55th Foundation Day of Communist <br/>Party of Philippines.  <br/> <br/>Coming to ideological -political work within the party, applying the Marxist principle of „from <br/>the masses to the masses‟, our Party was successful in conducting several political campaigns <br/>and movements in the last one year with the active involvement of P arty committees, PLGA, <br/>United Front and revolutionary masses. The CC called upon the democratic, revolutionary <br/>organisations to fight back the various anti -people bills brought forth by the BJP government at the <br/>centre such as Uniform Civil Code, Digital P rotection Data Bill and the New Forest Conservation <br/>Act. It exposed the reality in the Women‟s Reservation Bill that would not come into <br/>implementation for a long time even so. It extended solidarity to the people of Manipur struggling <br/>against the divisive  policies of the BJP government also in the state. It extended solidarity to the <br/>national liberation movement of Palestine where the people are facing heavy bombings and <br/>killings from the Israeli Zionists with the support of US imperialists and other weste rn powers.  <br/>A statement was issued by our CC on the occasion of  World Proletariat May Day for consolidating <br/>the proletariat class against the threat of Imperialist wars. Messages  were circulated by our CC on the <br/>occasion of observation of Martyrs day on July 28, the celebration of Party Foundation Day on 21st <br/>September and the PLGA Day on 2nd December. These celebrations and other occasions of<br/>meetings and demonstrations where the  effigies of Joe Biden, Benjamin Netanyahu and Narendra <br/>Modi were burnt in protest to Israel war on Palestine, Corporatization and Militarization was <br/>opposed invigorated the Party and the revolutionary masses with revolutionary zeal and in <br/>countering the h einous propaganda on our Party and the revolutionary movement by the enemy.  <br/>The party took up several political and military education campaigns to educate the cadres <br/>of the Party, PLGA and United Front. Special meetings of women activists of various ranks  were <br/>held in continuation to those in the earlier years. These meetings helped to deeply understand the <br/>problems faced in the process of their participation in the revolutionary movement and to work for a <br/>better understanding of the cadres towards patriar chy. With the efforts in the past years the <br/>revolutionary movement witnessed increase in women‟s leadership at various levels and also <br/>recruitment. Recruitment Campaigns were taken up at the mass level in villages, towns, districts <br/>and cities of India. Spe cial classes were held on Mode of Production, Nationality question and the <br/>Political Resolution of the CC in the Special Areas, Special Guerrilla Zones and States.  <br/>Military work  <br/>The main effort in the military sphere was to defeat Brahmanic Hindutva fascis m and <br/>counter -revolutionary Surajkund policy as a part of overcoming the temporary setback in the <br/>revolutionary movement. Following the dictum of “learn warfare from warfare”, PLGA comrades <br/>gained new experience in the battlefield. The enemy forces compris ed of National Security Guards <br/>and Garuda forces of the Indian Air Force under the direction of Home Minister Amit Shah <br/><br/><br/>launched an aerial attack to inflict severe damage to our leadership. But the alertness and strong <br/>counter offensive tactics of our PLGA  comrades nullified the nefarious plan of the enemy. In that <br/>retaliatory action 3 commandos of Garuda and NSG forces were annihilated and 6 commandos <br/>were injured. Further, three modern combat helicopters were badly damaged. This heroic counter -<br/>offensive h ighly motivated the PLGA forces and revolutionary masses whereas the morale of the <br/>enemy forces was profoundly demoralized.  <br/>In the last one year under the guidance of our Party several guerrilla actions were taken up <br/>by our PLGA forces. PLGA made efforts t o intensify and widen guerrilla war with the aim to <br/>overcome the temporary setback and advance the revolutionary movement. Some of the <br/>prominent ones are as follows:  <br/>On 26th April, 2023 in Darba Division in Aranpur our PLGA guerrillas annihilated 10 Distri ct <br/>Reserve Guards (DRG) in IED blast through Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign. This has <br/>brought nightmares to enemy forces. The daring Aranpur ambush was unexpected and shocked <br/>the enemy with a tunnel being dug beneath the main road where mines were arr anged.  <br/>In Bihar -Jharkhand of Eastern Regional Bureau region, our brave PLGA warriors are <br/>showing infinite courage and war skills in resisting fascist onslaught from past one year. In West <br/>Singhbhum region of Jharkhand, our PLGA comrades wiped out 15 polic e and injured 90 police <br/>forces in the unceasing patrols of the government armed forces of the central and the state <br/>governments.  <br/>In the several guerrilla actions in guerrilla zones and red resistance areas a total of 75 <br/>police personnel were wiped out and 163 were injured. Our PLGA annihilated some police <br/>informers, 10 anti -people elements, particularly fascist BJP leaders in the past one year. Our Party <br/>has taken special TCOCs during elections to state assemblies.  <br/>The revolutionary people and their militia , the base force of PLGA dug thousands of spike <br/>holes in order to restrict the capricious movements of the police personnel. Revolutionary masses <br/>developed general alert system like firing crackers when the police personnel enter revolutionary <br/>areas.  <br/>There  are incidents where the PLGA could break the encirclement of the police forces <br/>through strong retaliation like in Odisha. There were serious losses too. In Bihar -Jharkhand, five <br/>comrades of which two are members of SAC were killed through poison in an ene my covert action. <br/>In Dandakaranya a DvC member died in a covert operation in firing. Three comrades were caught <br/>as they were going to make a guerrilla action in Gadchiroli. A Commander of  Local Organising Squad  <br/>(LOS ) was caught and killed in Telangana.  <br/>Special Military leadership training programs were held in several zones and divisions in the <br/>last one year, with the objective to train the Politico -Military leadership corresponding to the <br/>changes in the military tactics of the enemy.   <br/>United Front  <br/>The Revolutionary People‟s Committees (RPC) and the Revolutionary Mass Organisations <br/>(RMO) worked with the task to fight back the present reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive of<br/>the enemy in order to overcome the temporary setback in the revolutionary mov ement. Thousands <br/>of revolutionary masses were mobilised in the revolutionary land reform campaign of the RPC held <br/>early every year. Other revolutionary development activities were taken up to raise the living <br/>standards of the people. The RPCs also held peo ple‟s courts to eliminate the enemy‟s intelligence <br/>network in the villages.  <br/>The RMOs took up struggles against the setting up of new police camps in the areas of <br/>revolutionary movement and against fake encounters. lakh of people mobilised to observe the <br/>Martyrs week and to celebrate other revolutionary days. The people participated with utmost vigor <br/>in the meetings. The RMOs also implemented the call given by ICSPWI to celebrate Martyrs Day <br/>for the whole month of July. This helped the masses of our country to know about the revolutionary <br/>heroes of the world who laid down their lives for the cause of socialist revolution.  <br/>Several mass movements such as against Brahmanic Hindutva Fascism, displacement, <br/>Corporatisation -Militarisation both legal and underground mass movements were built in the past <br/><br/><br/>one year  in towns, plain areas and cities, against Corporatization -Militarization of Forest belts, <br/>against imperialist loot of natural resources of the country, against displacement due to corporate <br/>development model, against the amendments of Forest Conservation Act and  the draconian Acts <br/>and for the implementation and protection  of Panchayats Extension to Special Areas Act  (PESA ). <br/>On various occasions along with intellectuals, students, human rights activists and civi l <br/>society we form ed united platforms against state repression, illegal arrests, detentions, fake <br/>encounters and aerial bombings. The RMOs took up the program of boycott of elections called by <br/>the party. The people of Guerrilla Base Areas totally boycotted the elections.  <br/>People demonstrated in large numbers against the fake encounter of two villagers of <br/>Gomme near Koyilibeda of Kanker district in C hhattisgarh. Following this, an indefinite <br/>demonstration was launched.  <br/>People‟s  Cultural  Organizations  in the pa st one year undertook several programs including <br/>making of audio and video presentations to  propagate  progressive, New Democratic and <br/>communist values in the masses. It also took up  special  programs to expose Brahmanical Hindutva <br/>Fascism in  forms of songs,  plays, dance, poetry and short films. The revolutionary cultural artists <br/>are upholding the mass struggles in their cultural programs and immediately responding to the <br/>ongoing developments in the domestic and international spheres, against state repression  and <br/>martyrs.  <br/>Several students and teachers organisations are working together against the New Education Policy <br/>of RSS -BJP to saffronise and privatise the education system. They are also raising their voice against the <br/>rise in the cost of education and cur tailment of "academic freedom" in higher education institutes. Several  <br/>urban Mass Organisations are working together such as the students‟ organisations against <br/>ragging, several kinds of organisations against BHF and in solidarity to Palestine. Acting on t he <br/>call of the party to take up demonstrations in solidarity to Palestine, people of various areas of the <br/>revolutionary movement in the country held meetings, processions and protest activities. A special <br/>propaganda campaign was taken up in protest to the repressive measures on the revolutionary <br/>movement in Jharkhand that was followed by all India Bandh on December 22nd. People blocked a <br/>Railway line in Jharkhand on the occasion demanding a stop to police patrols into the villages and <br/>setting up of police c amps.  <br/>In the given international and domestic situation, there is a rise in the people‟s struggles and <br/>resistance. There is a rise in people‟s struggles for right to land and forest, against land mafia and <br/>against corporatization -militarization  even in those areas from where our Party had to temporarily <br/>retreat due to enemy's severe repression. The  process of organising the people in secret organs, <br/>building armed formations, joining youth in PLGA and thus rebuilding the revolutionary movement <br/>in such areas is going on. The people of the country are further in the path of fighting for their right <br/>to jal -jungle -zameen -ijjat-adhikar (water -forest -land-self-respect -political power ). The situation is <br/>growing further favourable for revolution.  <br/>The part y understands that the fascist repression is going to intensify in the coming days <br/>and also that anti -Brahmanic Hindutva Fascist movements will come into being with great intensity. <br/>Isolating the enemy politically is the need of the hour. We need to unite the anti -Brahmanic <br/>Hindutva Fascist, anti -Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeois, anti -feudal and anti -Imperialist forces <br/>and work to bury Imperialism.  The party pledges to strengthen its ideological -political, military,<br/>organisational efforts to fight back the  reactionary Surajkund strategic offensive, overcome the <br/>temporary setback in the revolutionary movement and advance it. With its decades long <br/>experiences in working among the people fighting back fierce repressive campaigns of the Indian <br/>state, the party is strongly determined to take forth the New Democratic Revolution in India as a <br/>part of the World Socialist Revolution. It steps ahead in the path of Protracted People‟s War <br/>through Agrarian Revolution as an axle of New Democratic Revolution, uniting the four oppressed <br/>classes on the basis of worker -peasant alliance.  <br/> <br/>Workers and Oppressed people of all countries, Unite!  <br/>Long live Marxism -Leninism -Maoism!  <br/><br/><br/>Long live Proletarian Internationalism!  <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>Amrut  <br/>i/c, International Affairs  <br/>Central Committee  <br/>CPI (Maoist)</p></div>
