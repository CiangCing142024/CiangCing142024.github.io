COMRADE LENIN, LEADING LIGHT OF THE INTERNATIONAL PROLETARIAT AND GREAT TEACHER  OF MARXISM-LENINISM-MAOISM, ILLUMINATES THE PATH OF UNITY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST MOVEMENT "We  are  those  who  form  the  army  of  the  great  proletarian  strategist,  the  army  of Comrade Lenin. There is nothing higher than the honour of belonging to this army. " (Stalin) As the pages of History show, on the 21st of January 1924, Comrade Lenin, the great leader of the working class and oppressed peoples of the world, the second great milestone of M arxism- Leninism-Maoism, became immortal and left behind a great legacy of incalculable value. The teachings of Comrade Lenin, who transformed the "world of the future", the foundations of which were laid by Marx and Engels, from an abstract possibility into a concrete reality, are still fully relevant after a century and great upheavals in the world. In order to position oneself correctly in the class struggle, one must accept this "actuality" and orient oneself to it. This "actuality"  is  at  the  same  time  a  cure  against  reformist,  revisionist  and  parliamentary cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of any kind. It is the guarantee of faith and determination that a communist world can be created. LENIN AS THE TEACHER OF COMMUNISM WHO BROKE THE ICE AND PAVED THE WAY AGAINST INTERNATIONAL REACTION AND REVISIONISM<br> To  correctly  identify  the  contradictions  in  the  history  of  the  class  struggle,  to  grasp  the moments of historical rupture and to be ready in these moments of rupture was the most outstanding feature of comrade Lenin's entire struggle up to his immortality. After the death of Marx and Engels, the leadership of the international proletariat was for a long time taken over by the opportunism of the Second International, and in the words of comrade Stalin: "A period in  which  the  parties  of  the  Second  International  were  not  able  to  take  over  the theoretical struggle to liberate the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the  world  from  the  influence  of  these  opportunist  and  class-compromising  social- democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle for the liberation of the international proletariat  and  the  oppressed  peoples  of  the  world,  with  the  foundation  of  the Communist International he developed a form of organization and struggle appropriate to the dynamics of the class struggle in the new period of capitalism. " Comrade Lenin transformed the Communist Party and the Communist International into an instrument  of  war  against  the  bourgeoisie  by  liberating  the  Communist  Party  and  the movement  of  the  Communist  International  from  the  shackles  of  legal  forms  of  struggle : "Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was flabby philistinism and  sordid political bargaining,  parliamentary  diplomacy  and  parliamentary  scheming.  For  the  sake  of appearances,  of  course,  “revolutionary”  resolutions  and  slogans  were  adopted..."  but which it "keeps in the drawers  of offices",  freed  from the grip  of legal forms  of  struggle. “Meanwhile,  a  new  period  of  imperialist  wars  and  of  revolutionary  battles  of  the proletariat  was  approaching.  The  old  methods  of  fighting  were  proving  obviously inadequate  and  impotent  in  face  of  the  omnipotence  of  finance  capital.  It  became necessary to overhaul the entire activity of the Second International, its entire method of work, and to drive out all philistinism, narrow-mindedness, politicians’ tricks, renegacy, social-chauvinism and social-pacifism. It became necessary to examine the entire arsenal of the Second International, to throw out all that was rusty and antiquated, to forge new weapons. Without  this preliminary work it was useless embarking  upon war  against capitalism. Without this work the proletariat ran the risk of finding itself inadequately armed, or even completely unarmed, in the future revolutionary battles. The honour of bringing about this general overhauling and general cleansing of the Augean stables of the Second International fell to Leninism.”. (Stalin, Foundations of Leninism) Comrade Lenin, with his genius, grasped the core of the contradiction and realized that the struggle against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off  the  burdens  that  weigh  on  the  back  of  the  international  proletariat,  without  fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses the true character of these views in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary link between the "internal struggle" and the "external struggle", he waged the double struggle.<br>Comrade Lenin left us communists the extremely important lesson that the struggle against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the struggle against imperialism and all forms of ruling reaction. On the contrary, the struggle against imperialism must be purged of revisionism and opportunism. HOLD HIGH THE TEACHINGS OF LENIN WITHIN THE SHARPENING CONTRADICTIONS OF THE IMPERIALIST SYSTEM The imperialist system, which comrade Lenin analyzed in detail at the beginning of the 20th century, has survived in the past period, but its contradictions are sharpening and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonist contradictions. Although the dissolution of the USSR and the process  of  integration  into  the  capitalist  system  that  China  went  through  prevented  the contradictions  from  exploding for a while,  the law of  unequal development of  capitalism continued  and  the inter-imperialist rivalry developed  to  the stage of  "disintegration" with regional wars. This shows the crisis the system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who for a long time maintained their crisis by shifting the burdens of the system to the semi-colonies and deepening the plundering of the semi-colonies, have also reached a dead end here. One of the explosive points of the  inherent  problems of the imperialist system, which have developed in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism, is that the inter-imperialist struggle, which has manifested itself in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought out  in  regional  wars.  When  Lenin  enumerated  the  contradictions  of  imperialism,  he mentioned  the  inter-imperialist  contradiction  as  one  of  the  three  most  important contradictions.  We can see that developments are in line with comrade Lenin's observations on the character and contradictions of imperialism:  "The second contradiction is the contradiction among the various financial groups and imperialist Powers in their struggle for sources of raw materials, for foreign territory. Imperialism is the export of capital to the sources of raw materials, the frenzied struggle for monopolist possession of these sources, the struggle for a re-division of the already divided world, a struggle waged with particular fury by new financial groups and Powers seeking a “place in the sun” against the old groups and Powers, which cling tenaciously to what they have seized. This frenzied struggle among the various groups of capitalists is notable in that it includes as an inevitable element imperialist wars, wars for the annexation of foreign territories. This circumstance, in its turn,  is  notable  in  that  it  leads  to  the  mutual  weakening  of  the  imperialists,  to  the weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to the acceleration of the advent of the  proletarian  revolution  and  to  the  practical  necessity  of  this  revolution."  (Stalin, Foundations  of Leninism).<br>Russia  and  China,  the former socialist countries  that have given the imperialist system a respite with their new markets, have become the main players in the inter-imperialist rivalry, in contention with the hegemonic power United States. This means that the extent and nature of  the contradictions  have increased  with the growing involvement of  new and  powerful players in the struggle for the redistribution of territories. The big confrontation with the invasion  of  Russian  imperialism  in  Ukraine  took  place  against  this  background.  It  is foreseeable that this tendency will deepen and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, the areas where the wars of division are waged are semi-colonies  and  colonies.  The  semi-colonies  and  oppressed  peoples  of  the  world  will continue to pay the price of these wars until the imperialists declare direct war on each other. With this the division of world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries  –  masterfully  analyzed  by  Lenin-   deepen  even  more.  The  third  contradictions sharpens with the imperialist pillage and plunder , and the semi-colonial and semi-feudal rise in powerful Wars of National Liberation  and People’s Wars that shake the imperialist system. In  parallel  to  the  process  in  which  imperialism  is  going  under   the  inter-imperialist contradictions,   and  the  contradiction  imperialist  countries  and  oppressed  people’s  and nations; all parts of the ruling system, especially the imperialist states, are becoming more centralized, militaristic and warlike than before, paving the way for all fascist  sentiments to bring society into a corresponding ideological format. This is fulfilled either by  so called right- wing extremist or under the veil of social democratic or liberals parties.  The communists and the oppressed peoples of the world, faced with the reality of a system that is becoming more reactionary and aggressive by the day, need a Leninist Party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power , as outlined by comrade Lenin, in order to  organize a strong resistance against this  reaction. Only such a  Party,  today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist one,  can lead an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie. LENIN'S GREAT LEGACY, THE LENINIST CONCEPTION OF THE PARTY: THE  GENERAL STAFF OF THE PROLETARIAT   A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery;  it  cannot  be  so  refined,  so  leisurely  and  gentle,  so  temperate,  kind, courteous,  restrained  and  magnanimous.  A  revolution  is  an  insurrection,  an  act  of violence by which one class overthrows another .  (Mao Zedong). It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they position themselves in the face of developments. In the hundred years since the death of comrade Lenin,  the  imperialists  have  transformed  their  ruling  structures  into  even  bigger  war machines.  Their  armies,  police,  secret  services  etc.  are  equipped  with  capabilities incomparable to those of the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of those who call themselves  "communists"  or  "revolutionaries"  ignore  this  reality  (even  if  it  seems  to  be<br>theoretically  accepted)  and  are  far  from  positioning  themselves  in  accordance  with  it. However , by following an ideological and practical line of reconciliation that locks the working class and the oppressed masses into the ruling system, they dampen the anger of the masses and act as breakwaters. While the imperialists and the ruling structures of exploitation are equipping themselves with ever more violent apparatuses and institutions, it is necessary, as followers of comrade Lenin, to wage a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionaries" and "communists" are moving further and further away from the reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on arms and  violence.  Taking  comrade  Lenin's  relentless  struggle  against  the  opportunism  of  the Second International as a guide against these views is one of the important tasks to do justice to comrade Lenin in the centenary year of his immortality. Comrade Lenin defined the new type of Communist Party as "the war organization of the proletariat". This definition was necessitated due to the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the civil war that broke out with the October Revolution were the concrete reasons of why comrade Lenin called the communist party the "war organization of the proletariat". It is a necessity that the Communist  Party,  which  will  lead  the  emancipation  of  the  proletariat  and  the  oppressed masses, should have this characteristic, while the counterrevolution is arming itself from top to  bottom with the apparatus  and  means  of  violence and  is  committing all these terrible massacres against the working class and the oppressed peoples. A revolutionary war needs a fighting Party to wage it. Only fools and incorrigible revisionists who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it otherwise. Some people ridicule us as advocates of the “omnipotence of war”. Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is Marxist. The guns of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed.  (Mao Zedong). At its founding conference, the ICL defined the building and reconstitution of  Communist Parties  as  an  important  task  in  the  struggle  for  world  proletarian  revolution.  The understanding of the Communist Party developed by Comrade Mao Zedong is in line with the understanding of  the Communist Party outlined  by Comrade Lenin,  and  also  enriched  by Stalin, and is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the Party in the ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. In the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions in which we find ourselves, the communist party that is capable of opposing the growing aggression of imperialist reaction and leading the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world to liberation must have the quality of a "war organization of the proletariat". <br>An essential legacy of Lenin is the question of political power as the fundamental question of every revolution. Lenin showed how "The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without its replacement by a new one" and how  “all but power is an illusion ”.  Under Lenin's personal leadership, the world's first socialist State, the dictatorship of the proletariat was established, concreting the proletarian path to power and to maintain it.  After Lenin's death, it was his continuator Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it further and made it the basis of the entire International Communist Movement. Based on the shoulders  of  the  great  Lenin,  Chairman  Mao  was  able  to  advance  the  World  Proletarian Revolution to greater heights and to develop the  ideology  of the proletariat. Leninism that is today Marxism-Leninism-Maoism  must be embraced, defended and applied today.  As the ICL, we will continue to carry out the tasks raised by the great Lenin  and make good use of the legacy left to us by Comrade Lenin. Comrade  Lenin,  the  great  teacher of  the  international  proletariat  and  M arxism-Leninism- Maoism leads and guides our struggle for the world proletarian revolution today as he did yesterday! LONG LIVE MARXISM-LENINISM-MAOISM! LONG LIVE PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALISM! International Communist League January 2024</div>
