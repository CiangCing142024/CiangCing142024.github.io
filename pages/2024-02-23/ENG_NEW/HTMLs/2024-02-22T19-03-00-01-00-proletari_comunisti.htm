 It is difficult in times like ours, in our country where bourgeois ideology dominates more and more in the worker movement; And in different forms they contribute to this domain in the majority trade union organizations all the parties of the parliamentary arch and most of those who distinguish themselves from them but who remain on the ground of reformism.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is difficult to affirm and practice Leninism and the simple, and at the same time profound, observations that Lenin makes in the steps of his writings published last week.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is difficult in this context to form communist paintings, workers' avant -garde that have the courage and ability to go against the current.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   But this is absolutely necessary. And at the same time it is necessary to do it with revolutionary optimism,
  </b>
  Since, however, see it or think, the facts and objective developments of daily reality are there to demonstrate that the reality of the class and the masses goes in a completely different direction of dominant ideas, of the politics, culture and action of the parliamentary parties and trade union organizations
  <span>

 majority confederal.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no problem of the daily life of workers and workers who can be solved by the policies of current governments. The problems of work, the problems of salary, the problems of the deaths at work, the problems apparently external to the factory and instead of work, of school, health, transport, house, etc., they do not have one can have one Solution from these bourgeois governments.
 </p>
 <p>
  And, therefore, the spontaneous approach, even when it translates into struggles, workers and popular masses to these problems does not produce any solution of them in almost all cases; Indeed, the spontaneous approach even when it translates into struggles certifies the fact that these problems cannot be solved; And the natural consequence of the spontaneous movement is at this point to adapt to reality, or to the dominion of bourgeois governments, and produces non -class consciousness but distrust in struggle and change.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Therefore, the "spontaneous" struggle actually contradicts the equally spontaneous, even if confused and generic, aspiration for revolutionary change,
  </b>
  contradicts the inevitable, scientific main trend in today's society to a social and political revolution that abolishes the state of existing things.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   It is on this that Lenin's attention and indication is concentrated in the "What to do?".
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Without socialist theory that "determines the causes of the ailments of the working class", without assimilation of this theory, program, consequent political action, it is impossible for the class and for the masses to find the way for a real alternative, and to direct to the pursuit of This path is the struggle you do or that you want to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  This point is not a final point of a spontaneous process of the action of the consciousness of workers and masses, but
  <b>
   It is an initial point of the communist organization of the worker avant -garde who wants to change the state of existing affairs,
  </b>
  First of all in the ranks of the class and subsequently, leveraging it, in the general movement of the proletariat.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   For this reason, it is first of all to the communists and the workers' avant -garde change their "theory" and their practice
  </b>
  In order to change, in a dynamic, the movement of the class, the relationships of strength.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   It is certainly not enough to affirm the "primacy of political action on trade union action", without indicating which policy we are talking about and what stage is the communist organization and the avant -garde worker and proletarian
  </b>
  Generally understood, to find the teenage of the skein and decide what to do.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here too the theoretical and programmatic elements, propaganda and agitation, should not be sought in the sky of ideas, but descending in the "earth" of the problems of the daily life of the workers and masses and showing that none of them can be resolved without a General reversal of governments, of the states of the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
 <p>
  This does not ask a simple and only "explanation" but a concrete struggle against the solutions or false solutions placed and imposed by the forces acting in the ranks of the class and of the masses.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, in the current stadium the capitalist and imperialist system, its states, its governments bind the solution of the problems to the general framework - see today the tendency to war -, to the transformation of the problems and movements of the masses into public order problems, By equipping the state to affect and repress both the proletarian struggles, even more when they inevitably do not achieve their objectives and refl are, during their development.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, escaping from the state of existing affairs, deviating spontaneity and spontaneous course means for the proletarian avant -garde and the communist organization proposing, "imposing" political action on this ground, which is itself in a certain formative extent of A political consciousness of class, towards the revolution and socialism.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Basically, what is our main task?
  </b>
  Guide the economic struggle, to give spontaneity a value already of political consciousness? Or affirm theory, propaganda, agitation, organization capable of acting and handling this situation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Manage means affirming in the theoretical action and in the daily political practice that the interests "essential, decisive classes can be satisfied only with radical political transformations in general and that the fundamental economic interest of the proletariat can be satisfied only through a political revolution that replaces To the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (state, government, parties, press, etc. - editor's note) the dictatorship of the proletariat (state, government, press party, etc. of the proletariat - ed) ".
