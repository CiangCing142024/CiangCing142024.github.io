  Navalny's death in Russia in a Siberian prison is 
 Undoubtedly a crime of the Russian regime of Putin, an imperialist regime, a capitalist regime, a fascist dictatorship regime, a regime that 
 invaded Ukraine for imperialist purposes, a regime that - in forms 
 simplified - can be defined as a neozarist.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 This type of regime towards the political opposition - whatever 
 It is - uses repression, persecution, imprisonment and, in 
 Some cases produce death. On this there can be no 
 doubts. It doesn't matter who the figure of Navalny was, here the problem is 
 What is the regime in Russia and on this the advanced proletarians, i 
 authentic communists, Marxists, Leninists, Maoists, always have 
 denounced what happened in Russia with the Restoration 
 capitalist.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That which is 
 occurred in Russia - Socialimperialist state outside, 
 Socialfascist inside - is a definition that we must 
 First of all to the Communist Movement, to the Chinese Communists who have 
 fought what happened in Russia and denounced the 
 transformation of this state, from
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 Socialist state with problems e 
 limits, to a neocapitalistic state with a red bourgeoisie that has 
 capitalism restored. And the evolution of 
 This state has been consequent to this internal transformation that 
 has crossed several phases - of which it is not the time to do 
 The story - and has arrived in Putin; Russia's path was of the same nature as what happened 
 for the heads of the communist parties who have gone through a phase of 
 revisionist transformation started with Togliatti and the way 
 socialist Italian, continued with all the subsequent secretaries of the 
 PCI, up to the historical compromise, to the acceptance of NATO of 
 Berlinguer, up to the degeneration by stages that led to Renzi, etc. etc.
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this does not 
 it absolutely questioned that we are in Italy, in the arch 
 of the world dominated by US imperialism, that governments of states 
 Europeans have been imperialist, which the Italian state is a state 
 imperialist. And that war in Ukraine is a war for interposed 
 person, that US imperialism, European governments, including Italy, 
 they want to transform into war of aggression against Russia into one 
 new world war of distribution of the world which, on behalf 
 western imperialism has the objective of canceling the 
 Imperialist opponents, resize the other imperialist powers 
 And therefore Russia and China first of all, which are their competitors 
 worldwide.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There is no 
 doubt that we are against US imperialism, against what it is 
 By happening in Ukraine, we consider the Zelensky regime a vassal 
 of imperialism. We consider most of the oppositions 
 internal to Russia aspiring to a state and a society that can 
 be part of international, economic, political integration, 
 Strategic and military of US, European imperialism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One thing are the 
 interimperialist contradictions and our firm opposition to each 
 imperialism, another thing is to have a positive evaluation of the 
 Putin's Russia and consider his internal behavior as 
 justified and therefore acceptable.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Navalny was a 
 man gradually transformed into a Western pawn, there is not 
 doubt, his line and his Putin's reversal policy was 
 To open the road to a western regime, assimilated to western imperialist powers. But this 
 He must not lead us to hide what happened in Russia, 
 On the other hand, all imperialist regimes behave to the same 
 manner: war outside, repression, modern fascism, 
 persecution of opponents inside.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What we should 
 To say of what happens, to give an example of which many talk about it, to the journalist founder of Wikileaks who has unmasked 
 crimes and secrets of American wars and which is why it is 
 persecuted and the Americans are doing everything to come 
 Extremely, and, if it happened, will his destiny be the death penalty? Not 
 Let's see many political forces and press bodies that put in 
 Discussion This crime against Assange. Not to say what 
 It happens in Ilaria Salis in Hungary or that happens to opponents in 
 France, in Italy, in Germany, or what happens to 
 opponents in Latin America, in the states of the third world tied 
 to western imperialism, of what happens in India, and so 
 Street.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On all this we do not see at all many "beautiful souls" in 
 Field that today sanctify Navalny, but let's see something worse; Today 
 The figure of Navalny is used to foment the war against Russia, 
 then to feed the march towards a worldwriter who 
 involves this war logic, to support the spectacular 
 Increase in military spending, to support the Ukrainian pro -Filonist regime filled with weapons of all kinds and types. Indeed, the Navalny issue 
 shows how, in the name of Navalny, a “Union 
 Sacra ”from PD to the Meloni government parties, which is objectively and, for most parties, 
 Subjectively, a reactionary campaign, warfondaia.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Who talks about 
 freedom for opponents in Russia but wants war to 
 Russia, wants to support and feed all the activity that 
 Western imperialism, NATO, the Italian government, do in 
 direction of the war. And on this there can be no doubt 
 that we are against all this; And let's tell the proletarians, to the masses 
 popular, once again, not to be deceived by the countryside of 
 All parties, of the whole press, of all television.
  <b>
   There 
 Navalny Campaign is a war campaign not a defense campaign of 
 A political persecuted.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The responsibilities of political persecution in 
 against Navalny who led to his death in prison, without doubt they fall beyond the material facts 
 which may have caused the repressive state political action of the 
 Russian imperialist state, in the hands currently of Putin.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <b>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No to this 
 infamous warflower campaign, no to the national unity around the 
 Figure of Navalny who is part of the march towards a war 
 world interimperialist.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Yes instead to the 
 Fight against repression in our countries, against march 
 reactionary and dictatorial of the governments of our country towards 
 of the proletarian anti -fascist antimperialist, contrary 
 war, contrary to environmental devastation, contrary to 
 restriction of the right of strike, of the right of information, 
 etc.
