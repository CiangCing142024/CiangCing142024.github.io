 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Friday 23 and Saturday 24 there are two important national days a 
 support of the Palestinian people. Both have the first word 
 order "stop the genocide" because nobody can anymore 
 hiding that what the Nazi Zionist state pursues 
 of Israel and its ultrarectional and mold government 
 Indeed neonazine of Netanyahu is the genocide of the people 
 Palestinian, his expulsion from his lands - those who are 
 remained - his expulsion from the Gaza Strip. And everyone knows that 
 Then it would be up to the West Bank.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nobody can now 
 hide that this happens with the practice of massacres, gods 
 mass bombing which, in the name of the self -styled fight against 
 terrorism, a whole people are striking. 30,000 dead, 100,000 
 injured, women, children, all civil structures are destroyed 
 from the action of Israel who writes a new historical page of 
 crimes of humanity of imperialism and reactionary regimes.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Because of this 
 "Stop the genocide" is clearly a password that 
 We support and fully justify the day of struggle of 23 e 
 The national event of 24.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  However, in 
 at the same time, let's say clearly that fighting genocide means 
 support the resistance of the Palestinian people. Describe the people 
 Palestinian as an immanent mountain of victims who is undergoing 
 in front of the genocidal crime of the state of Israel, it is only a part 
 of truth and is a part of the truth that often hides 
 an hypocrisy and a lie.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The people 
 Palestinian is punished for having rebelled because the resistance 
 he raised the shot against
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 of the Zionist state of Israel, 
 Against his invasion, his employment. The Palestinian people 
 He wants the free and secular Palestinian state. Want freedom, the 
 Earth. The right to exist and to recover what the state 
 Zionist of Israel sustained with imperialism has removed him.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The state 
 Palestinian wants to carry on the historical struggle that began with 
 the Olp, continued with the phases of war of people and armed struggle 
 Antimperialist and antixionist, conducted for many years. Wants 
 rebel against a fate that could only be the expressed one 
 currently. Strategic positions of the Zionist state of Israel e 
 from the general interests of imperialism that supports it. This 
 rebellion has gone from the various nipsa, the Palestinian people have 
 paid a very high cost to his heroic resistance and this heroic 
 Resistance came to October 7 to still show the world that 
 There can be no justice in that area and peace without justice. 
 Justice means law of the Palestinian people to have his own 
 State against the presence of imperialism and its gendarme 
 in the area. This is in the interest of all the Arab masses, of 
 the whole Middle East, of all the oppressed peoples of the world, and today, 
 in a context in which the imperialist powers march towards the 
 war to stop the hand of imperialism that marches towards the 
 war - which is always consolidation and oppression, distribution of 
 territories and energy goods and sources of raw materials that 
 they belong to peoples by crushing peoples.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this it is 
 Just tie the two days to the fight against the war 
 imperialist in progress with names and surnames and in all areas of the 
 world, whose main subject is American imperialism, the 
 Born, the imperialist governments of European states, of the States 
 capitalists and our government, accomplice of the genocidal march in 
 Act of the state of Israel.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Precisely in these 
 hours, these days, then the "Aspides" mission starts, one 
 mission that wants to bring European and Italian imperialist troops, 
 in particular in the area, to combat solidarity with resistance 
 imperialist, in this case the people of Yemen, called Houthi 
 which is leading right and necessary military attacks against it 
 Zionist state of Israel against those who support him, putting in 
 danger of navigation in the Red Sea which is the center of one of the 
 Important centers in the area, the center of traffic centers 
 world. For whose reasons we also want to erase the people 
 Palestinian.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are against 
 The Italian imperialist mission that reaches these 
 days the Red Sea. The transformation of Italian soldiers into 
 mercenaries of imperialism, in oppressors of the peoples, and will also be 
 right that the imperialist troops - including Italians - find one 
 response not only social, human, but also military, because 
 imperialism, how much it is defeated, becomes weaker, how much 
 leads his operations and these affirm themselves, become more 
 strong. And imperialism that becomes stronger strengthens governments 
 within these imperialist countries that use this force 
 To crush the workers and proletarians, the popular masses 
 within the country.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The more it goes on the 
 warfounding of the Italian government, the more it is crushed 
 Inside, to our people, the proletarians and popular masses are understood, the war, the costs of the war, is more discharged, more 
 On them the damage of 
 A war economy.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this we are 
 Because Italian imperialism takes the blows, weaken. 
 Weakening he strengthens the fighting of the proletarians inside.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  23 and 24 in 
 These manifestations of solidarity with the Palestinian people must 
 bring the struggle against our imperialism forcefully, because 
 This helps the Palestinian people and helps in internationalist form i 
 proletarians and popular masses in our country.
