    We comment: Lenin's precision is very important for 
 differentiate the two ways to develop capitalism in a country - one, the road 
 Junker, Prussian or landowner of slow evolution of semi -feudality, of the 
 Another route, the Farmer route of destruction of the landowner and fast system 
 development of capitalism; as well as to differentiate countries 
 developed (now imperialist) capitalists of the semi -feudal countries and 
 semicolonial on whose base a bureaucratic capitalism develops. As 
 It is seen in North America. In Lenin's study, capitalism in the agriculture is going 
 imposing displacing extensive agriculture by intensive agriculture, 
 small by the surface it occupies compared to the extensive, but 
 "Great" for the amount of invested capital and the use of wage labor.

    At the time of imperialism, in its last phase, in the 
 moment of its greatest decomposition, when this is even more monopoly, more 
 parasitarian and more rotten, it exports its capitals to our countries to 
 monopolize the land, directly or through its economic agents the 
 landowners and the great native bourgeois (great "modern" estates) 
 And so with low capital investment compared to what they would need to 
 produce in the imperialist countries themselves practice agriculture 
 extensive, which strips the peasantry, ruins the land for production 
 peasant, appropriate water, and drives bureaucratic capitalism to the 
 Guide production not to the national market but to the world market (market 
 Imperialist), deepening the condition of the country as a primary exporter.

    For this section, agricultural census data were collected 
 Recent from six important Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, 
 Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. The type and amount of data collected 
 In the census of each country they vary considerably and, therefore, the 
 Depth of the analysis is limited by the availability of the data. By 
 This reason, the attention will focus mainly on Brazil and Peru, who have 
 The most detailed data, and will include only limited data from Colombia, 
 Venezuela, Argentina and Mexico.

    The first thing to highlight of the data is the continuum 
 Predomination of great landowners in these countries. Despite the 
 frequent statements over the years that great estates 
 They would disappear due to their inefficiency and inability to compete with 
 Small and medium more productive producers, this does not seem to be the case. 
 As Table 1 shows, the large properties of 500 hectares or more occupy 
 Most agricultural lands in all countries studied, note to 
 Page 3 and the highest properties of more than 1,000 hectares occupy almost 
 half of all agricultural lands in Brazil and Venezuela, more than two 
 -Tercios in Peru and three quarters of all agricultural lands in 
 Argentina and Colombia.

    In other words, although the concentration of the earth has 
 decreased in some places in recent years, it is still extreme in the 
 most of the main Latin American countries, and the countryside is still 
 dominated by great landowners. However, it should be noted that there are 
 Significant differences between countries and within them. In some 
 Countries, like Chile, the great unproductive estates are practically 
 non -existent (Bengoabengoa reference 2013), while in other countries, such as 
 Colombia are omnipresent. There are also significant differences 
 From one region from one country to another. The northeast of Brazil, for example, has a 
 significantly different agrarian structure from that of the south or southeast of 
 Brazil, and these differences should not be overlooked.

    In addition, concentrated property and predominance of great 
 properties do not necessarily mean that the earth is underutilized or that 
 It operates under a logic of risk minimization. In some regions, 
 large farms are used for mechanized intensive agriculture, and 
 In many Latin American countries, agriculture areas have been developed 
 highly productive. In fact, countries like Brazil and Argentina have 
 experienced an important boom in soybean production in recent years, 
 and much of this production is carried out in mechanized farms of large 
 size.

   <span>
    Therefore, to have an idea of the relative weight of the 
 large mechanized farms compared to other forms of production 
 Less intensive, I look for data on the use of the specific land of 
 Great farms. Figure 1 shows the use of land in large 
 Properties in Brazil, Colombia and Peru, the only countries for which 
 had data on the use of the specific land of the size of the 
 farms These properties are almost entirely dominated by 
 extensive activities such as grazing and forests, and more than 80 percent 
 of the land they occupy is dedicated to these two activities, while only 
 A small portion is used for cultivation. This seems to be the case too 
 For other countries, since the data on the general use of the land 
 They reflect this same general pattern. AND
    <u>
     n other words, although it is true that in 
 Some regions large properties are used for intensive crops, 
 The general trend is clearly the opposite: in the great farms of 
 Latin America predominate extensive activities such as grazing and 
 forests.

    Not only do extensive activities predominate, but 
 Statistics on Earth use reveal low investment and low productivity 
 of these types of production. In grazing lands, for example, if 
 We divide the total number of animals into large farms by the total 
 hectares of pastures, the large farms in Brazil have only 0.65 animals per 
 hectare of grazing land, while in Peru it is incredibly low, 
 0.06 animals per hectare (IBGE 2012; INEI 2012). This means that these 
 landowners averages much less than one animal for each hectare of land 
 grazing, while small properties can have between 2 and 10 
 animals per hectare. In Peru, small farms of less than 
 fifty hectares average 12 animals per hectare of grazing land, 
 approximately two hundred times more than the great properties of the country (INEI 
 2012).

     Brazilian census data on production and investment

    . Although the large farms of five hundred hectares or more occupy the 
 56 percent of all agricultural lands in Brazil, represent only 36 
 percent of the total production value and represent only 43 percent 
 of total investment (IBGE 2012). This contrasts markedly with small

    These findings are also supported by information from the 
 Brazil Agrarian Reform Agency, which reported in 2010 that more than 50 for

    Thus, despite the limitations of census data 
 agricultural, we can confirm that agricultural structures in these countries 
 They continue to be characterized by an extreme concentration of the earth and are 
 dominated by large properties that use low production strategies 
 investment and low productivity. What gives rise to this situation, I maintain, is 
 The prevalence of land appropriation based on portfolio and relationships 
 of the resulting property, which exempt the great owners of the 
 market pressures to maximize the productivity of its properties. Without 
 However, detailed information about appropriation can rarely be found 
 of land in the data of the agricultural census, so I turn to the 
 Secondary literature in search of evidence of this. ”
