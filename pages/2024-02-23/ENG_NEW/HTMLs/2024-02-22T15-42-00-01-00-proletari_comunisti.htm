  Today (yesterday), just as we are talking, the body of the 
 fifth worker who from Friday 16 February was under the 
 rubble of the construction site of what is the workers' massacre of Florence 
 for profit.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  According to the press, 
 among other things, they are still trying to understand, to identify the 
 presence of the workers. As the prosecutor wrote,
  <i>
   “
  </i>
  <i>
   And
  </i>
  <i>
   a situation
  </i>
  <i>
   in which
  </i>
  <i>
   There is the problem of 
 match the names to the bodies. Therefore a complex has also begun 
 identification activities on what remains of these poor people 
 workers, started with the help of experts and that requires skills 
 genetic specifications. Because
  </i>
  <i>
   It is the C
  </i>
  <i>
   now are 
 Really in dramatic conditions. "
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Only this should 
 to horrify and make us understand the system we live in, a system 
 in which in a huge construction site you do not know who is there even 
 working. But this is the mirror of the condition they want 
 Bring the whole working class, all workers. For this system 
 imperialist we are slaves and that leads us to die every day like 
 the slaves.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is true, like 
 denounces an inspector, that the "work has changed". But the work 
 has changed because it has adapted to the thirst for profit and 
 exploitation that led to deregulation on the spot of 
 Work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is good to put on 
 center, as has also been said here by the unions, that there is a 
 link between Bergamo and what happened in Florence.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Of course there is a 
 link! And the bond is what Bergamo/Brescia are a basin of 
 labor of
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 thousands of workers exploited and underpaid to black, 
 of which construction is one of the main centers. We take into account that a 
 Bergamo are among the most important national construction companies, 
 those, to understand each other, of the Master Percassi, and around there is 
 all an induced business and employment lenders, a basin of 
 corporal, of whom everyone is aware, made by the masters but 
 Also endorsed by the confederal unions.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  “
  <i>
   8 workers in 
 A work team, but employees of three different companies "
  </i>
  . AND 
 The journalist wonders: “Companies or manpower loans, 
 So corporals? " Because this is the problem: it cannot exist 
 a master of a company of 23 employees who claim to say, like 
 said that of the company Go Costruzioni, Mr. Ghezzi,
  <i>
   "the 
 My employees among the dead? I don't know "!
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  But let's go back to 
 premise, that is, that the work has changed. Let's see the situation in 
 particular in Bergamo, already reported since 2016 by the CISL, the union that today 
 It does not even do the 2 shameful hours of strike. They say these ******* 
 Bastards of the CISL that:
  <i>

  <i>
   And

   pito hard the 
 construction sector in the province of Bergamo. In 7 years, according to data 
 of the union, are

 I work in the sector ... "
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   m
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   to 
 On the other hand they say they bloom -

  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  How, the union "cannot 
 accept "when in this situation there has been the whole issue 
 of the
  <b>
   bonuses to redo the houses, the green light was given to a 
 unbridled increase in exploitation and working conditions in 
 Restricted times and that are the main cause of injuries and that the union has endorsed.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  If this is the 
 Union situation let's see what the work inspectorate says 
 Always on Bergamo:
  <i>
   “i
  </i>
  <i>
   construction companies: for
  </i>
  <i>
   l’
  </i>
  <i>
   Inspectorate 
 of work the irregularity is the rule, the
  </i>
  <i>
   80%
  </i>
  <i>
  </i>
  <i>
   And
  </i>
  <i>
   out -of -law according to the inspection carried out last year and 62% 
 companies do not respect the rules for safety. "
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Some short data 
 To give an idea of this immense situation:
  <i>
   5000 construction companies 
 inspected in 2021, of which the
  </i>
  <i>
   80%
  </i>
  <i>
   find irregular, 
 1605 businesses suspended in the first
  </i>
  <i>
   3
  </i>
  <i>
   months of the year
  </i>
  <i>
   p
  </i>
  <i>
   For 
 failure to comply with the safety rules, the 200 accidents one al 
 minute.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Clearly the thing 
 more scandalous is that these complaints come 
 Facted in the National Congress of Filca Cisl in Bergamo and the trade unionists knew very well the situation of irregularities. And then they come 
 justified, always in this national congress, by this sort 
 of national unity: institutions, labor inspectorate, unions 
 Connivents and masters ...
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Here's what he says 
 Vanessa Pesenti, president of Ance Bergamo, who reiterates
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   to be
  </span>
  <i>
   "An unacceptable wound for the country and for each of us."
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  But fuck you, we 
 let's say! But how is it possible to find a solution 
 If these institutional tables do not break, this rubber wall, 
 that we find ourselves in the jobs when we look for, with difficulty, 
 to bring out what are the working conditions e 
 of exploitation! This applies to construction sites, but also applies to 
 factories, because within the jobs, in all places 
 of work are not the unions that would be the first they have to check, the representatives of the security workers are alone 
 Four white flies are the ones who do their job and I don't know if 
 Not even there are at the moment in Bergamo.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  When our daily factory activity 
 comes out of the workplace and is reported in the bodies in charge - e 
 that we should intensify, organize, also through 
 an organization of superior struggle that is that of the network for the 
 Safety - What are we in front of us? What are in front of them 
 workers or combative unions trying to get these out 
 conditions? There are the rubber wall of the entities in charge, 
 of the Ausl, of the work inspectorates that every now and then 
 they denounce, like when the case as Florence breaks out, like so many 
 others, and then don't change anything anymore, because they do square between 
 of them the confederal unions, the masters and the various governments that do 
 they succeeded, including the last one, who have weakened any 
 I wait for safety. It is not enough to condemn
  <i>
   "changes 
 of the legislation that led to a deregulation in the chain 
 of contracts
  </i>
  <i>
   ha
  </i>
  <i>
   Description of security "
  </i>
  as 
 A union like CGIL says.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The problem is not 
 only this last government but is the whole system that must be put in 
 discussion and that's why a battle is needed 
 national, but a battle that starts in every single job 
 and which involves, in fact, from workers to the inspectors, come on 
 delegates, RLS, journalists, intellectuals, all those who 
 understand that this continuous massacre, this daily war in 
 jobs is the mirror of a putrefaction company that 
 it must be overturned in order to truly put the 
 Work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Because the problem 
 It is that capital makes work harmful, not the work itself.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  We have 
 started with these "invisible" workers of which you do not 
 He still knows the name now, and we want to say some things respect 
 to their working condition reported by the brothers and by 
 Family:
  <i>
   “Mohamed always worked. He lived in Bergamo - he explains 
 His brother - he told me that he started every morning with a van 
 led by others to reach the Florence site. Then in the evening 
 He returned home and then left the next morning. It was a hard work, 
 So he said, he didn't earn a lot, half money gave them to him 
 Regularly, the other half instead was in black.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Another story is 
 The one told by the brother of the Tunisian boy:
  <i>
   ”
  </i>
  <i>
   a
  </i>
  <i>
   veva 
 only 19 years old when he left Tunisia to come to 
 Italy. I remember that day, when he left our back ours 
 City, greeting our parents, was happy to leave. Volev
  </i>
  <i>
   a
  </i>
  <i>
   A different future, embarked on that ship and left. To that 
 time could be traveled freely between one bank and another of the 
 Mediterranean."
  </i>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This for 
 Closing is the link between Bergamo and Florence. With the government with the League, i 
 racists, the fascists, the masters feel more and more free of 
 take advantage of the workers more and more, but on the other hand there are these 
 other proletarians, these brothers of ours, so we must transform 
 This pain in anger and organization to respond to theirs 
 dead.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  So what 
 We are doing we summarized it before, what anyway 
 We will continue to do, as well as to bring the complaint to the places of 
 work and also to the initiatives to be held, is to bring 
 the need for the organization within jobs 
 Compared to the safety and battle to be done against it 
 exploitation but also that for having wage increases. 
 Because another central data is also that of hunger wages 
 of workers as well as that of precarious contracts.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  We must give 
 permanent signs of a daily struggle that cannot wait for the 
 Next massacre of workers.
