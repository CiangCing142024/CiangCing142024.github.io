  <p>
   As a Palestinian reality in Italy we launch an appeal to all 
 individual workers and all unions to strike on Friday 23rd 
 February to stop the genocide.
  </p>
  <p>
   Simple solidarity is no longer enough: the Italian government is 
 openly deployed with Israel, against hundreds of thousands of 
 people took to the streets in recent months. Only concrete actions can 
 force Meloni and his ministers to retire from a war in which 
  they are an active part with the
   <span>

  </a>
  propaganda, with the sale of weapons, with the 
 Commercial and academic agreements.
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   We block Italy against the position of the government, of NATO, 
 of the European and western states that support the genocide that 
 Israel has been carrying out on October 7th and the colonial occupation that lasts 
 For over 75 years in Palestine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The price of the war in the Middle East, as of the war in Ukraine e 
  of the "other peacekeeping missions" around the world, the 
 workers and unemployed, as always the last. War is one 
 catastrophe that we will find ourselves in the increase in the bill, in the cart 
 spending, in the increases of rents and transport.
  </p>
  <p>
   We ask Arab workers, Muslims and foreigners not to turn 
 On the other hand: you have to be in the front row for our sisters e 
 brothers killed and imprisoned in Palestine, for those who are sacrificing themselves 
  In the fight against colonialism, for freedom and justice. Who 
 better than us he knows this struggle and hears it on his skin every 
 day? Racism is the tool that exploits us in the West and in 
 our countries torture us. From Italy we must not mobilize only in 
 rescue of our massacred people, who resist and will still resist: 
  Let's do it for us, let's mobilize because the governments that kill us 
 they are the same that sucking the blood and make your life 
 impossible and miserable; they are the same that remove the rights and 
 they reduce to hunger those who work, who close hospitals and schools, since 
  they still can't bomb them like their Israeli friends.
  </p>
  <p>
   The unemployed also have to go down to us in the square because the state 
  Italian, who spends millions for weapons and to finance wars a 
 lost fund, it is the same as that has removed citizenship income and the 
  other social support devices, because unemployment is the 
 The result of a crisis that has one of its main causes in the war.
  </p>
  <p>
   From 7 October the Palestinians, and the front of the resistance that from 
 Lebanon passes through Iraq and arrives at Yemen, they are giving a lesson to 
  World: the last can rewrite history, they can raise the 
 head and powerful can bleed.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore we invite each union and every worker with conscience a 
 block the factories, ports, warehouses and everything you can 
 Until the genocide of a people who claim justice 
  And freedom.
  </p>
  <p>
   Against the colonial and imperialist war
  </p>
  <p>
   We block everything
  </p>
  <p>
   We block the war car
  </p>
  <p>
   With Palestine until victory!
