  Israeli police said the Palestinian combatants who carried out the operation were killed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Israeli Internal Security Service (Shin Bet) identified the Palestinians as the two brothers Muhammad and Kazem Zawahra-from Al-Taamra village-and Ahmed Al-Wahsh from Zaatara, near Belém.
 </p>
 <p>
  The al-Jazeera correspondent Walid Al-Quomari reported, citing Israeli sources that Palestinian armed men opened fire against an Israeli military control post near the village of Al-Za'im, east of occupied Jerusalem.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Israelite occupation forces sent large reinforcements to the area and closed the roads.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Israeli channel 13, one of the aggressors deliberately crashed into a car to cause an accident, resulting in a traffic jam. Then three fighters went down and set fire to the vehicles with two M-16 rifles and a pistol, killing and hurting soldiers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Municipality of Ma'ale ADUMIM appealed to the Israeli settlers to remain in their homes,
 </p>
 <p>
  The shooting at the Military Control Post near Ma'ale Adumim took place days after a similar operation that occurred in the settlement of Kiryat Malachi, east of Ashdod, which resulted in the death of two Israelis.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Heroic Operation’
 </h4>
 <p>
  The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas described the operation as “heroic”, considering it as a natural response to Israeli massacres and mass crimes in the Gaza and West Bank.
 </p>
 <p>
  "The incursion of occupation in Jerusalem and its planning to prevent the faithful from coming to the Mosque de Al-Aqsa during Ramadão will not bring it security," Hamas said in a statement.

     “The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) blesses the heroic operation south of occupied Jerusalem this Thursday morning, which is a natural response to the occupation’s massacres and crimes in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.

  According to the Ministry of Health of Gaza, 29,410 Palestinians were killed and 69,465 injured at the Israeli Genocide in Gaza, which began on October 7.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, at least 7,000 people are missing, presumably killed under the rubble of their homes throughout the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Palestinian and international organizations say most of those dead and injured are women and children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Israel states that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-AQSA flood operation on October 7.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  More weapons
 </h4>
 <p>
  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said Israeli citizens will continue to receive weapons from the government.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ben-Gvir called for the restriction of the freedom of circulation of Palestinians and the placement of even more barriers.
 </p>
 <p>
  "The right to life of Jewish residents in the West Bank is more important than the freedom of movement of the residents of the Palestinian authority," said Ben-Gvir, according to the Times of Israel.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another extreme right politician, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, demanded the approval of a plan for thousands of new housing units in Ma'ale Adumim and in nearby illegal colonates in response to Palestinian operation.
 </p>
 <p>
  "The serious attack on Ma'ale Adumim must have a decisive security response, but also a response from the colonates," he wrote at X.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I demand that the Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) take advantage of the Superior Planning Council and immediately take the plans for thousands of housing units in Ma'ale Adumim and throughout the region,” he continued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Parallel to the War in the Gaza Strip, the Israelite army intensified its raids in cities, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank, killing hundreds of people and holding more than 7,000 civilians.
