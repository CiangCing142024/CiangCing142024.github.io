     Genoa was in bloom
     <em>

     There is also a flyer distributed during the celebration of Mass in the Church Gran Mother of God. "
     <em>
      We bring 
  our solidarity with those who are locked up and to those who fight inside and outside the

 instigation to crime contested at 17 suspects. Under accusation there is not 
 Only in Turin, but also in other cities, solidarity for Alfredo 
 So, protagonist of a very long hunger strike still 
 Restricted under 41bis in the Sassari Bank prison.

    <span>
     AND 
  To pay the consequences are the anarchists and the antagonists who 
 they protest against hard prison. The solidarity flyer and the 
 attempt to exhibit a banner stopped by a faithful during the 
 Mass become a proof of subversion.
