Formally, the ICDs are places where the State brings together migrants who arrive in Spain irregularly, to expedite their expulsion - that is, the return to their countries of origin - while providing minimum services of maintenance of food and housing for satisfy your basic human rights. The reality is very different: the CIEs are prisons where the National Police torture and commits all kinds of humiliations and vexations against human dignity.

  The torture committed is so obvious and wild, and the National Police feel with such impunity, that some of these cases end up coming to light. The masses find a way to denounce it despite being in a situation of isolation, torture and harassment day after day. It is undeniable even by the bourgeois state itself, and the multiple complaints demonstrate it. And only the tip of the iceberg is visible. That's why

  The CIEs are more than 35 years of history and were born with the League Law. Currently, these centers is the backbone of the repressive policy of the imperialist bourgeois state against migrant masses without papers. All that migrant in an irregular situation that is not interesting for the State -that is, those that are not wildly exploited in the field, in the construction, in the industry, in domestic care or that is not a forced sex slave to prostitute itself - It is sent to these prisons.
