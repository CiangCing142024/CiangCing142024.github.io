      The 
  Committee activists, including some students of the University for 
 foreigners of Siena, after having exposed Palestinian flags and signs 
 invoked the end of the genocide, they contested to Minister Bernini 
 the complicity of the government in the genocide of the Palestinian people, 
 asking for the immediate end of any academic relationship with 
 Israeli University, participate in the employment system and 
 Apartheid in occupied Palestine.

      To the

 he expressed on university boycott does not take into account on the one hand 
 of the historical context, if we want to call the genocide in place by 
  1949 to today, and on the other of the role of the Israeli universities in 
 system of apartheid and exploitation of Palestine.

     Not 
  We believe it is useful to take part in a blow and media response that 
 Start from the social networks, yesterday we posed concrete problems for the rector, 
 And it is on what we can accept a comparison. We are therefore not 
 opposed to discuss the reasons for which it is necessary to break 
 Even academic and research agreements with Israel. However, we are 
 people who study every day, work or must still 
 worry every day for the next day, our time is 
 usefully employed if it can affect the reality of the facts. Until today 
  The rector Montanari reiterated his unavailability to terminate 
 The agreements, in fact undermining every basis of dialogue. The mass in 
 public discussion of this position, namely the declaration 
 to be available to consider the requests of the 
 Palestinian people, it is therefore an indispensable premise to sit down to a 
 discussion table ".

     On 
  This we mention the Pacbi guidelines (Palestinian Campaign for the 
 Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel) of the BDS movement 
 (Boycott, divestment and penalties), which are certainly 
 exhaustive: 'Academic institutions are a key point of the 
 ideological and institutional structure of the oppression regime, 
 Colonialism and Apartheid of Israel against the Palestinian population. 
 Since its foundation, the Israeli academy has written its 
 destiny with the political-military establishment in Israel, e 
 Despite the efforts of a handful of academics of principle, 
 The Israeli Academy is deeply implicated in the support and in the 
 perpetuation of the systematic refusal of Israel of the rights of 
 Palestinians'.

 <p>

   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     "As 
  general imperative rule, all academic institutions 
 Israeli, unless proven otherwise, are subject to boycott, a 
 due to their ten -year, profound and conscious complicity in 
 perpetrate the Israeli employment and the denial of rights 
 fundamentals of the Palestinians, both through their silence, and 
 represents an effective involvement aimed at justifying, hiding or 
  otherwise deliberately diverting attention from violations 
 Israeli of international law and human rights, or even 
  through their direct collaboration with state agencies in the 
 planning and in the realization of projects that violate the law 
 international and the rights of the Palestinians. Consequently, these 
 institutions, all their activities, and all activities that 
 They sponsor or support must be boycotted. You should 
 put an end to all projects with Israeli academic institutions, 
  as it was with the South African academic institutions below 
 The apartheid ".

     AND 
  evident that for the Israeli console any not aligned item 
 It is dangerous and should be repressed. But it is understandable, because so 
 It works in Israel, whose government is imposing violently, both at 
  interior that at the outside of the country, the consent towards the 
 extermination of the Palestinian people. Among other things, the console, in his 
 declarations, makes an operation, this yes, very serious: superimposes 
 Zionism and Judaism, then alluding to anti -Jewish measures 
 Nazi -fascist, to try to confuse today's torturers with the 
 Victims of yesterday.

     This 
  For us it is offensive towards the memory of that immense 
 tragedy that were racial laws and the holocaust. The console, 
 In short, it climbs awkwardly and dangerously on the mirrors for

 proportions. We, on the other hand, very simply, are on the side of whom 
 Also in these hours it is killed under the Israeli bombs with the 
 complicity of our institutions. It is necessary to do everything that 
  The genocide stops and Palestine is freedom from colonialism 
 Zionist".

     From 
  five months the committee was formed, but for many of us this 
 Battaglia started a long time before. The Committee claims continuity 
 with struggles in solidarity with the Palestinian people who for decades yes 
 they carry out in Italy. It seems absurd to us to remember again that the 
 current situation was not born on 7/10/2023, but determined by 
 A now secular colonial expression.

     Here 
  There is also the reply to the question asked: nobody within the arch 
 parliamentary ventures to deny Israel the right to defend 
 employment, oppression and apartheid towards Palestine and i 
 Palestinians. The distance between these parties, from Brothers of Italy to 
 Italian left, and what we see and do in the squares, in the 
 university and also on jobs (for example, remember for example 
 protests and blocks in different Italian ports against the transport of 
 weapons towards Israel) is unbridgeable and explains well the reasons for that 40% of 
 Italians who have no interest in sanctioning the choices with his own vote 
 NATO and European Union policies.

   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     View 
  We are not expecting the situation that the institutions, occupied by such 
 subjects, are convinced of the goodness of our positions. Our 
 solidarity with the Palestinian resistance is not only human, but it derives 
 From the fact that we share the same enemy: that block of power 
 Eurotlantic and imperialist who in Palestine finances a genocide, 
 While in Italy the people are silent, gathering the criticism and 
 repressing dissent. Our main interlocutors are the 
 Italians who do not bend to accept to be accomplices of the 
 genocide. If the spectators get up, puppets must also 
 stop doing theater ”.
