Although the large farms of five hundred hectares or more occupy the \n 56 percent of all agricultural lands in Brazil, represent only 36 \n percent of the total production value and represent only 43 percent \n of total investment (IBGE 2012). This contrasts markedly with small \n farms of less than fifty hectares, which occupy only 13 percent \n of the Earth but represent 35 percent of the total value of production \n and 28 percent of the total investment.\n    <u>\n     In other words, great farms \n They occupy more than four times more land than the little ones, but they have only a 1 \n percent more total production value and only 15 percent more than \n total inversion.\n    </u>\n    These findings are also supported by information from the \n Brazil Agrarian Reform Agency, which reported in 2010 that more than 50 for \n one hundred of all great properties and 72 percent of all lands \n occupied by large properties were considered \u201cunproductive\u201d according to \n Agency parameters (Incra 2011).

What gives rise to this situation, I maintain, is \n The prevalence of land appropriation based on portfolio and relationships \n of the resulting property, which exempt the great owners of the \n market pressures to maximize the productivity of its properties. Without \n However, detailed information about appropriation can rarely be found \n of land in the data of the agricultural census, so I turn to the \n Secondary literature in search of evidence of this. \u201d\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    <o:p>\n    </o:p>\n    The long interpolation that belongs \n to\n    <b>\n     :\n    </b>\n    <b>\n     <span style='font-family: Helvetica, \"sans-serif\";'>\n      Agrarian Structure and Underdevelopment in Latin America:\nBringing the Latifundio \u201cBack In\u201d,\n     </span>\n    </b>\n    <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/search?filters%5BauthorTerms%5D=Chris%20Carlson&amp;eventCode=SE-AU\">\n     <span>\n      <span data-v-63dfaf6e=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit;\">\n       Chris Carlson\n      </span>\n     </span>\n    </a>\n    ,\n    <span>\n     Published\nonline by Cambridge University Press:\n     <strong data-v-862424e6=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-stretch: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; line-height: inherit;\">\n      <span style=\"border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0cm;\">\n       02 January 2022\n      </span>\n     </strong>\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    2.\n    <span>\n     <b>\n      Importance of the subject and some news of agricultural movements in the related EU\n     </b>\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    It was already said at the end of the 19th century, and retains its \n News, that:\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">\n    </span>\n    It is a phenomenon \n curious the fact that agriculture gains political importance in the same \n extent to which it loses economic importance in relation to the industry.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">\n    </span>\n    It is apparent \n contradiction between economic importance and political importance, \n Explain if we remember that, everywhere, the private property of the Earth \n has entered into contradiction with the\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    existing mode of production long before property \n deprived of the other means of production and engendra much faster \n An unsustainable and unbearable situation.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">\n    </span>\n    It is not surprising that \n agricultural issues occupy so vividly in civilized states to \n men who direct political life.
