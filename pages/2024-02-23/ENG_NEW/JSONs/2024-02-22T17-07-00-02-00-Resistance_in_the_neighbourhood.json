The 30,000 are touched by the recorded dead! Thousands of injuries and an unknown number overwhelmed under the ruins! At the same time that hunger, thirst and illness reap those who escape the bombings, Israel is preparing to intervene with land forces in Rafa, where it has displaced over 1,000,000 Palestinian civilians, supposed to be \"safe\". The Nazi atrocities in repeat!

The country has been transformed into an advanced US-NATO prison, on a vast basis for the sake of their deadly weapons from Souda to Alexandroupolis.\n   <b>\n    The government is escalating the country's involvement in the war by sending the frigate \"Hydra\" to the Red Sea and taking over the administration of the frigates that will be sent there.
