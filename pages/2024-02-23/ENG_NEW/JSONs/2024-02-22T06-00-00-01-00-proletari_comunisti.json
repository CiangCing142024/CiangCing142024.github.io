{"title": "PC February 22 - Ex Ilva - The Government: Post Extraordinary Administration, new masters to look for - but who are they?", "published time": "2024-02-22T06-00-00-01-00", "images": [], "content": "<div class=\"post-body entry-content\" id=\"post-body-4256723377754575597\" itemprop=\"description articleBody\">\n <p>\n  The world steel market has been in crisis of overproduction for a long time; a relative overproduction in the capitalist system because the sale of steel must create profits for the masters, certainly not because the need for steel does not grow in the world with many countries that need accelerated industrial development in which steel has a important use.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Taranto plant is strategically placed in a key point towards the new markets that in perspective open in North Africa, in the Middle East. Owning Taranto means having a fundamental ring of the world chain of steel production. But the truth is that the masters, all, in a phase like this, the plants want them \"free\", that they are delivered to him at four money and in which they can have a free hand in the type of production, in the exploitation of the labor force , on environmental and judicial issues.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   This is the condition required today by all steel producers in Italy, Europe, in the world.\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The government has commissioned the former Ilva and then find a new investor who takes it and relaunches it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   But who are the new investors\n  </b>\n  . From the newspapers you know they would be the\n  <b>\n   Vulcan Green steel\n  </b>\n  . A multinational that is building a 5 million tons of pre -labor and, as you know, pre -labor is one of the prospects for environmentalization, for the production transformation of Taranto's Ilva. The investment in Oman is two billion dollars. Now he is looking for a steel mill in\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n able to produce steel. The owner is Naveen Jindal son of the Jindal. In Italy Jindal was the rival of ArceloMittal to acquire the Ilva, lost the race and poured out on Piombino, doing damage.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  So Vulcangreensteel is a 'by -product' of Jindal. According to when Il Sole 24 Ore writes, Jindal is looking for productive capacity to close the cycle with the pre -launch. A plant with a three billion dollar investment is about to open \u00ecn Nigeria, precisely because the heart of the investments has put it in Nigeria.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Indians of this group would like ILVA, but by putting maximum one and a half billion resources and think of a reduced Ilva with 5,000 employees in all, therefore with a halving of the current working class of the plant and the same as the contract\n </p>\n <p>\n  The other competitors, this very sponsored this also for its national character by the Meloni government, but also by the Federacciai and on a substantial part of the union, is\n  <b>\n   Arvedi.\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Il Sole 24 Ore writes: 'Arvedi is mentioned, invoked every time a change of shareholding is expected in the former Ilva. Min. Giorgetti and Arvedi Industrial of the North are linked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arvedi's position has always been of willingness to intervene in combination with the public shareholder, that is to say if the money puts the public partner, and as long as there is Tabula Rasa compared to the previous. That is, the same things that Arcelormittal asked. Moreover, his plan would focus only on electrosiderurgia, a new laminated and three electric ovens should be built in Taranto but this means that when it is fully operational in several years, 5,000 workers are enough, not how many are in Taranto today, with the consequent net downsizing of the survey. Another 2,000 could remain in Novi Ligure and Cornigliano.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Arvedi, however, is thinking of an agreement on the story with Tata Stell, an Indian too.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Finally we arrive at the\n  <b>\n   Ukrainian group metinvest\n  </b>\n  who is advancing as an interlocutor. Metinvest sees the first interesting business in Cornigliano. Metinvest is owned by Ukrainian Oligorca Rinat Akhmetov. Ukraine, from unsuspected times, well before the war broke out, is dominated by an industrial-financial oligarchy, of the same nature as the Russian one, even if on a smaller scale. Akhmetov's personal heritage is 5.7 billion dollars, with two interest centers, finance and steel. It appears on the list of the 500 richest men in the world and has two purposes: the money and the need to acquire product capacity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The special operation\" by Vladimir Putin has made its main steel steel in Ukraine, Azovstal of Mariupol, a zombiestan,\n </p>\n <p>\n  Akhmetov noted Piombino. The Meloni government proposed Taranto to Akhmetov and there would be the liking of the Americans.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here, what is then behind the nationalist thrusts of the Meloni government: the state of Meloni is the state of the multinationals that support it, with which it is linked, and therefore according to this hypothesis the state that enters the Ilva, with the government Meloni would have Akhmetov as the owner. That, as Il Sole 24 Ore always says 'is buying productive ability all over the world', what he had done and continues to do Mittal. Meetinvest, however - always according to this press - does not want to get in conflict with ArceloMittal, because it is clear that with the Ilva in the hands of others it will be war among the steel multinationals .. and the effects will also be downloaded on the workers again.\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "The world steel market has been in crisis of overproduction for a long time; a relative overproduction in the capitalist system because ...", "author": ["fannyhill"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/02/sul-mercato-dellacciaio.html"}
