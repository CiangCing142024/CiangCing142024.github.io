<p>
  The world steel market has been in crisis of overproduction for a long time; a relative overproduction in the capitalist system because the sale of steel must create profits for the masters, certainly not because the need for steel does not grow in the world with many countries that need accelerated industrial development in which steel has a important use.
 </p>
<p>
  The Taranto plant is strategically placed in a key point towards the new markets that in perspective open in North Africa, in the Middle East. Owning Taranto means having a fundamental ring of the world chain of steel production. But the truth is that the masters, all, in a phase like this, the plants want them "free", that they are delivered to him at four money and in which they can have a free hand in the type of production, in the exploitation of the labor force , on environmental and judicial issues.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   This is the condition required today by all steel producers in Italy, Europe, in the world.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  The government has commissioned the former Ilva and then find a new investor who takes it and relaunches it.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   But who are the new investors
  </b>
  . From the newspapers you know they would be the
  <b>
   Vulcan Green steel
  </b>
  . A multinational that is building a 5 million tons of pre -labor and, as you know, pre -labor is one of the prospects for environmentalization, for the production transformation of Taranto's Ilva. The investment in Oman is two billion dollars. Now he is looking for a steel mill in
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 able to produce steel. The owner is Naveen Jindal son of the Jindal. In Italy Jindal was the rival of ArceloMittal to acquire the Ilva, lost the race and poured out on Piombino, doing damage.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  So Vulcangreensteel is a 'by -product' of Jindal. According to when Il Sole 24 Ore writes, Jindal is looking for productive capacity to close the cycle with the pre -launch. A plant with a three billion dollar investment is about to open ìn Nigeria, precisely because the heart of the investments has put it in Nigeria.
 </p>
<p>
  The Indians of this group would like ILVA, but by putting maximum one and a half billion resources and think of a reduced Ilva with 5,000 employees in all, therefore with a halving of the current working class of the plant and the same as the contract
 </p>
<p>
  The other competitors, this very sponsored this also for its national character by the Meloni government, but also by the Federacciai and on a substantial part of the union, is
  <b>
   Arvedi.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Il Sole 24 Ore writes: 'Arvedi is mentioned, invoked every time a change of shareholding is expected in the former Ilva. Min. Giorgetti and Arvedi Industrial of the North are linked.
 </p>
<p>
  Arvedi's position has always been of willingness to intervene in combination with the public shareholder, that is to say if the money puts the public partner, and as long as there is Tabula Rasa compared to the previous. That is, the same things that Arcelormittal asked. Moreover, his plan would focus only on electrosiderurgia, a new laminated and three electric ovens should be built in Taranto but this means that when it is fully operational in several years, 5,000 workers are enough, not how many are in Taranto today, with the consequent net downsizing of the survey. Another 2,000 could remain in Novi Ligure and Cornigliano.
 </p>
<p>
  Arvedi, however, is thinking of an agreement on the story with Tata Stell, an Indian too.
 </p>
<p>
  Finally we arrive at the
  <b>
   Ukrainian group metinvest
  </b>
  who is advancing as an interlocutor. Metinvest sees the first interesting business in Cornigliano. Metinvest is owned by Ukrainian Oligorca Rinat Akhmetov. Ukraine, from unsuspected times, well before the war broke out, is dominated by an industrial-financial oligarchy, of the same nature as the Russian one, even if on a smaller scale. Akhmetov's personal heritage is 5.7 billion dollars, with two interest centers, finance and steel. It appears on the list of the 500 richest men in the world and has two purposes: the money and the need to acquire product capacity.
 </p>
<p>
  "The special operation" by Vladimir Putin has made its main steel steel in Ukraine, Azovstal of Mariupol, a zombiestan,
 </p>
<p>
  Akhmetov noted Piombino. The Meloni government proposed Taranto to Akhmetov and there would be the liking of the Americans.
 </p>
<p>
  Here, what is then behind the nationalist thrusts of the Meloni government: the state of Meloni is the state of the multinationals that support it, with which it is linked, and therefore according to this hypothesis the state that enters the Ilva, with the government Meloni would have Akhmetov as the owner. That, as Il Sole 24 Ore always says 'is buying productive ability all over the world', what he had done and continues to do Mittal. Meetinvest, however - always according to this press - does not want to get in conflict with ArceloMittal, because it is clear that with the Ilva in the hands of others it will be war among the steel multinationals .. and the effects will also be downloaded on the workers again.

<p>
  Navalny's death in Russia in a Siberian prison is 
 Undoubtedly a crime of the Russian regime of Putin, an imperialist regime, a capitalist regime, a fascist dictatorship regime, a regime that 
 invaded Ukraine for imperialist purposes, a regime that - in forms 
 simplified - can be defined as a neozarist.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 This type of regime towards the political opposition - whatever 
 It is - uses repression, persecution, imprisonment and, in 
 Some cases produce death. On this there can be no 
 doubts. It doesn't matter who the figure of Navalny was, here the problem is 
 What is the regime in Russia and on this the advanced proletarians, i 
 authentic communists, Marxists, Leninists, Maoists, always have 
 denounced what happened in Russia with the Restoration 
 capitalist.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That which is 
 occurred in Russia - Socialimperialist state outside, 
 Socialfascist inside - is a definition that we must 
 First of all to the Communist Movement, to the Chinese Communists who have 
 fought what happened in Russia and denounced the 
 transformation of this state, from
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 Socialist state with problems e 
 limits, to a neocapitalistic state with a red bourgeoisie that has 
 capitalism restored. And the evolution of 
 This state has been consequent to this internal transformation that 
 has crossed several phases - of which it is not the time to do 
 The story - and has arrived in Putin; Russia's path was of the same nature as what happened 
 for the heads of the communist parties who have gone through a phase of 
 revisionist transformation started with Togliatti and the way 
 socialist Italian, continued with all the subsequent secretaries of the 
 PCI, up to the historical compromise, to the acceptance of NATO of 
 Berlinguer, up to the degeneration by stages that led to Renzi, etc. etc.
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this does not 
 it absolutely questioned that we are in Italy, in the arch 
 of the world dominated by US imperialism, that governments of states 
 Europeans have been imperialist, which the Italian state is a state 
 imperialist. And that war in Ukraine is a war for interposed 
 person, that US imperialism, European governments, including Italy, 
 they want to transform into war of aggression against Russia into one 
 new world war of distribution of the world which, on behalf 
 western imperialism has the objective of canceling the 
 Imperialist opponents, resize the other imperialist powers 
 And therefore Russia and China first of all, which are their competitors 
 worldwide.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There is no 
 doubt that we are against US imperialism, against what it is 
 By happening in Ukraine, we consider the Zelensky regime a vassal 
 of imperialism. We consider most of the oppositions 
 internal to Russia aspiring to a state and a society that can 
 be part of international, economic, political integration, 
 Strategic and military of US, European imperialism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One thing are the 
 interimperialist contradictions and our firm opposition to each 
 imperialism, another thing is to have a positive evaluation of the 
 Putin's Russia and consider his internal behavior as 
 justified and therefore acceptable.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Navalny was a 
 man gradually transformed into a Western pawn, there is not 
 doubt, his line and his Putin's reversal policy was 
 To open the road to a western regime, assimilated to western imperialist powers. But this 
 He must not lead us to hide what happened in Russia, 
 On the other hand, all imperialist regimes behave to the same 
 manner: war outside, repression, modern fascism, 
 persecution of opponents inside.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What we should 
 To say of what happens, to give an example of which many talk about it, to the journalist founder of Wikileaks who has unmasked 
 crimes and secrets of American wars and which is why it is 
 persecuted and the Americans are doing everything to come 
 Extremely, and, if it happened, will his destiny be the death penalty? Not 
 Let's see many political forces and press bodies that put in 
 Discussion This crime against Assange. Not to say what 
 It happens in Ilaria Salis in Hungary or that happens to opponents in 
 France, in Italy, in Germany, or what happens to 
 opponents in Latin America, in the states of the third world tied 
 to western imperialism, of what happens in India, and so 
 Street.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On all this we do not see at all many "beautiful souls" in 
 Field that today sanctify Navalny, but let's see something worse; Today 
 The figure of Navalny is used to foment the war against Russia, 
 then to feed the march towards a worldwriter who 
 involves this war logic, to support the spectacular 
 Increase in military spending, to support the Ukrainian pro -Filonist regime filled with weapons of all kinds and types. Indeed, the Navalny issue 
 shows how, in the name of Navalny, a “Union 
 Sacra ”from PD to the Meloni government parties, which is objectively and, for most parties, 
 Subjectively, a reactionary campaign, warfondaia.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Who talks about 
 freedom for opponents in Russia but wants war to 
 Russia, wants to support and feed all the activity that 
 Western imperialism, NATO, the Italian government, do in 
 direction of the war. And on this there can be no doubt 
 that we are against all this; And let's tell the proletarians, to the masses 
 popular, once again, not to be deceived by the countryside of 
 All parties, of the whole press, of all television.
  <b>
   There 
 Navalny Campaign is a war campaign not a defense campaign of 
 A political persecuted.
  </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The responsibilities of political persecution in 
 against Navalny who led to his death in prison, without doubt they fall beyond the material facts

  Yes instead to the

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Friday 23 and Saturday 24 there are two important national days a 
 support of the Palestinian people. Both have the first word 
 order "stop the genocide" because nobody can anymore 
 hiding that what the Nazi Zionist state pursues 
 of Israel and its ultrarectional and mold government 
 Indeed neonazine of Netanyahu is the genocide of the people 
 Palestinian, his expulsion from his lands - those who are 
 remained - his expulsion from the Gaza Strip. And everyone knows that 
 Then it would be up to the West Bank.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nobody can now 
 hide that this happens with the practice of massacres, gods 
 mass bombing which, in the name of the self -styled fight against 
 terrorism, a whole people are striking. 30,000 dead, 100,000 
 injured, women, children, all civil structures are destroyed 
 from the action of Israel who writes a new historical page of 
 crimes of humanity of imperialism and reactionary regimes.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Because of this 
 "Stop the genocide" is clearly a password that 
 We support and fully justify the day of struggle of 23 e 
 The national event of 24.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  However, in 
 at the same time, let's say clearly that fighting genocide means 
 support the resistance of the Palestinian people. Describe the people 
 Palestinian as an immanent mountain of victims who is undergoing 
 in front of the genocidal crime of the state of Israel, it is only a part 
 of truth and is a part of the truth that often hides 
 an hypocrisy and a lie.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The people 
 Palestinian is punished for having rebelled because the resistance 
 he raised the shot against
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 of the Zionist state of Israel, 
 Against his invasion, his employment. The Palestinian people 
 He wants the free and secular Palestinian state. Want freedom, the 
 Earth. The right to exist and to recover what the state 
 Zionist of Israel sustained with imperialism has removed him.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The state 
 Palestinian wants to carry on the historical struggle that began with 
 the Olp, continued with the phases of war of people and armed struggle 
 Antimperialist and antixionist, conducted for many years. Wants 
 rebel against a fate that could only be the expressed one 
 currently. Strategic positions of the Zionist state of Israel e 
 from the general interests of imperialism that supports it. This 
 rebellion has gone from the various nipsa, the Palestinian people have 
 paid a very high cost to his heroic resistance and this heroic 
 Resistance came to October 7 to still show the world that 
 There can be no justice in that area and peace without justice. 
 Justice means law of the Palestinian people to have his own 
 State against the presence of imperialism and its gendarme 
 in the area. This is in the interest of all the Arab masses, of 
 the whole Middle East, of all the oppressed peoples of the world, and today, 
 in a context in which the imperialist powers march towards the 
 war to stop the hand of imperialism that marches towards the 
 war - which is always consolidation and oppression, distribution of 
 territories and energy goods and sources of raw materials that 
 they belong to peoples by crushing peoples.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this it is 
 Just tie the two days to the fight against the war 
 imperialist in progress with names and surnames and in all areas of the 
 world, whose main subject is American imperialism, the 
 Born, the imperialist governments of European states, of the States 
 capitalists and our government, accomplice of the genocidal march in 
 Act of the state of Israel.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Precisely in these 
 hours, these days, then the "Aspides" mission starts, one 
 mission that wants to bring European and Italian imperialist troops, 
 in particular in the area, to combat solidarity with resistance 
 imperialist, in this case the people of Yemen, called Houthi 
 which is leading right and necessary military attacks against it 
 Zionist state of Israel against those who support him, putting in 
 danger of navigation in the Red Sea which is the center of one of the 
 Important centers in the area, the center of traffic centers 
 world. For whose reasons we also want to erase the people 
 Palestinian.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are against 
 The Italian imperialist mission that reaches these 
 days the Red Sea. The transformation of Italian soldiers into 
 mercenaries of imperialism, in oppressors of the peoples, and will also be 
 right that the imperialist troops - including Italians - find one 
 response not only social, human, but also military, because 
 imperialism, how much it is defeated, becomes weaker, how much 
 leads his operations and these affirm themselves, become more 
 strong. And imperialism that becomes stronger strengthens governments 
 within these imperialist countries that use this force 
 To crush the workers and proletarians, the popular masses 
 within the country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The more it goes on the 
 warfounding of the Italian government, the more it is crushed 
 Inside, to our people, the proletarians and popular masses are understood, the war, the costs of the war, is more discharged, more 
 On them the damage of 
 A war economy.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this we are 
 Because Italian imperialism takes the blows, weaken. 
 Weakening he strengthens the fighting of the proletarians inside.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  23 and 24 in 
 These manifestations of solidarity with the Palestinian people must 
 bring the struggle against our imperialism forcefully, because 
 This helps the Palestinian people and helps in internationalist form i 
 proletarians and popular masses in our country.

  Law No. 92 of 30 March 2004 established the ‘Day of Remembrance’ to be celebrated as a national solemnity every year on 10 February. This anniversary is intended to call into question, for now on a level of political propaganda, the defeat suffered by Fascist Italy on the eastern border with the defeat of the Second World War.

  Law No. 92 of 30 March 2004 established the ‘Day of Remembrance’ to be celebrated as a national solemnity every year on 10 February. This anniversary is intended to call into question, for now on a level of political propaganda, the defeat suffered by Fascist Italy on the eastern border with the defeat of the Second World War.
 </br></br></p>
<p>
  Within the framework of the outcome of the First World War, the imperialist slaughter had secured Italian imperialism possession of a series of zones that extended within some of the Balkan states. Fascism’s imperialist policy had relied on this to expand the state borders. The whole thing thus took on a definite colonial character. On 10 February 1947, Italy, as imperialism allied with Nazi Germany, was partially sanctioned and saw its colonial territory, the result of the robberies of the First World War, reduced in size. The partial re-establishment after little more than twenty years in favour of the Republic of Yugoslavia, and thus today of Slovenia and Croatia, is now presented as a great exodus, bordering on genocide, to which the ‘Italians’, i.e. the monarchist and fascist imperialist colonisers of those territories, were forcibly forced. This partial re-establishment of borders in favour of the legitimate populations that were robbed and militarily occupied after 1918 is an aspect that testifies to the strongly internationalist character of the joint work of the Italian resistance led by the communists and the war of national liberation led by the Yugoslav partisans.
 </p>
<p>
  10 February 1947 is a date that represents a progressive historical passage that also, albeit very partially, affected an area strongly characterised by fascist corporate militarism by weakening a system that passed almost intact into the Italian Republic.
 </p>
<p>
  In simpler words, the treaties imposed on Italy served, albeit for a few decades, to ‘keep at bay’ its imperialist expansionism on the eastern border and its ever-living neo-colonial aspirations. The Italian Republic, in the 1947 treaty, did not even want to formally recognise the defeat of Italian fascism. That is, of a loyal ally of Hitler’s and Japan’s Nazism.
 </p>
<p>
  The treaty thus represented for imperialist Italy after the Second World War not an acknowledgement of its responsibilities, let alone an opportunity for adequate self-criticism, but only a bitter pill to be quickly digested while waiting for better international arrangements that might have allowed a resumption in ‘republican’ form of what had begun first with the Kingdom of Italy and then with Mussolini.
 </p>
<p>
  The 10 February, the so-called ‘day of remembrance’, an explicit manifestation of historical revisionism, thus in essence conceals a viscerally nationalist campaign that refers to an alleged injustice suffered by the ‘Italians’ and thus aims to reiterate the need to question national borders in order to launch a new expansionist season.
 </p>
<p>
  In our country there is a deep anti-fascist sentiment still rooted among the popular masses, and there have been countless moments of struggle by those who have grasped how prominent themes such as ‘foibe’ and ‘exodus’ are vehicles of fascist propaganda. Honest historians and anti-fascist comrades have engaged in attempts to denounce and stem an unworthy campaign of denigration against the Italian and specifically the Yugoslav resistance, but all these positions have often been
 </p>
<p>
  seen as an expression of the ongoing dialectic in a democratic country, rather than others only as a battle to be won on the level of historical expertise, with the writing of books by ‘experts’ able to demonstrate how things really happened. This is undoubtedly an important battle, and credit must be given to those who have publicly opposed even on these grounds the most blatant historical revisionism, even exposing themselves to assaults by squadrism and censorship by institutions, fascists and opportunists of all stripes.
 </p>
<p>
  Instead, what has not been brought to the fore is that the issue of 10 February is an integral part of an imperialist and fascist policy and that it is not just an attempt by certain areas to raise their heads again, but the structural nature of a fascism that has never really been countered in our country and that has now been resurfacing for decades with the ongoing full dismantling of the parliamentary republican state form. A fascism organic to Italian imperialism and the struggle for the full reconquest of former spheres of influence.
 </p>
<p>
  So the “day of remembrance” is in itself a celebration that represents an act that is part of a real preparation for war. In fact, over all these years, a real aggression has been carried out against the fragile and small countries bordering us such as Slovenia and Croatia. It is an aggression that has developed on a cultural and propaganda level on the part of state institutions and the RAI, and on a more operational level with the mobilisation of fascist manoeuvres that have a structural and militant presence in Italy and are now in government. The “day of remembrance” requires the allocation of funds, institutional celebrations, working groups, public conferences and interventions in schools, etc.
 </p>
<p>
  On 31 January, the Council of Ministers approved the decree-law establishing the ‘Museo del Ricordo’ that will be built in Rome and will be financed with at least 8 million euro for the first four years.
 </p>
<p>
  On the evening of Monday 5 February, the national network RAI uno broadcast in prime time ‘La Rosa dell’Istria’, yet another film that once again deals with the issues surrounding the “day of remembrance”, and which follows previous productions such as ‘Il cuore nel pozzo’ (The Heart in the Well) and ‘Red Land – Rosso Istria’, in which the worst clichés propagated by fascism about partisans being rapists and murderers and defenceless Italian victims of good intentions are reiterated.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to fiction, several docufilms have been made and broadcast in schools in recent years, and RAI is engaged in direct research abroad, even with explorations of karstic cavities in places that were the scene of military clashes in World War II.
 </p>
<p>
  On 16 January, a RAI film crew with a Tg2 journalist explored the Bliznji karst cavity in Slovenia accompanied by speleologists with the aim of searching for human remains to be attributed to presumed ‘infoibati’ [thrown in karstic cavities called foibe]. Video footage was later shown of the troupe’s car vandalised by unknown persons.
 </p>
<p>
  However, it is clear that the populations of the republics of Slovenia and Croatia have been subjected to heavy ideological attacks and political provocations by Italian nationalism for years.
 </p>
<p>
  These attacks and provocations are carried out in ways that involve both institutions and various militant fascist organisations in synergy, as in the customary initiative that is held every January in Gorizia, organised by the “XMAS veterans” outside and in the atrium of the municipality, and which always sees the presence of institutional representatives wearing the tricolour sash in memory of the battle of Tarnova.
 </p>
<p>
  The battle of Tarnova, today Slovenian territory but under fascist control in 1945, was a significant step in the struggle waged by the People’s Liberation Army of Yugoslavia with the participation of several communist Garibaldian partisan brigades against Nazi-fascist troops. This initiative was not only rightly contested by local anti-fascists, but also strongly criticised by Slovenian institutions, which were irritated and concerned by the continuation of these provocations. However, these are still weak stances that show the lack of a truly anti-fascist line and unable to denounce the growing threat at the border.
 </p>
<p>
  This year, the mayor of the Slovenian town of Nova Gorica described the initiative of the Italian institutions, reactionary and fascist parties as a demonstration ‘against free Europe’, thus appealing to alleged and illusory European values that should somehow counteract Italian fascism and imperialism and somehow guarantee Slovenia’s right to be respected as a sovereign nation.
 </p>
<p>
  Every year, the President of the Republic of Slovenia and the President of the Republic of Croatia are present on the island of Rab at the commemorations on the Saturday closest to the date of 11 September. The ceremony is deeply felt by the people who remember their martyrs from the fascist concentration camp opened in July 1942 and closed on 11 September 1943 with Italy en route. This camp is strongly denounced as an extermination camp where more than 15,000 prisoners were interned during the Nazi-Fascist occupation of Yugoslavia.
 </p>
<p>
  It should be pointed out that Italy refuses to participate with its institutional representatives in such ceremonies to symbolically apologise. A further demonstration of how the imperialist occupation that was conducted by the Kingdom of Italy under fascism is not repudiated.
 </p>
<p>
  The Slovenian newspaper ‘Delo’ recalls that the President of the Italian Republic was also invited to the ceremony, but that ‘Mattarella was not in Rab last weekend and the Italian media remained mostly silent about the event’.
 </p>
<p>
  Another nation in the sights of Italian political, economic and military expansionism was Albania, which was the ‘Italian Protectorate of the Kingdom of Albania’ from 1939 to 1943 during the fascist occupation. At the end of the war, the Degasperi government refused the handing over of more than 100 Italian war criminals, requested by the new state to be tried, thus repeating the same policy adopted against Yugoslavia. The formal conclusion of the war of aggression was sanctioned with the signing by the Italian Republic of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1947, the same date put on the ‘day of remembrance’.
 </p>
<p>
  Albania has been a target of Italian imperialism again since 1992 with the open support of Prime Minister Sali Berisha and the signing of a friendship agreement in 1995. Berisha was later forced to resign on charges of being the architect of shady financial activities responsible for sending thousands of Albanians to the brink of bankruptcy. It is worth mentioning that Berisha was awarded the highest of the Italian Republic’s honours ‘l’Ordine al merito’ in 1996. As soon as this figure was publicly burned, Italy switched to supporting other currents and today recognises as a privileged interlocutor Prime Minister Edi Rama with whom Meloni signed on 6 November 2023 the memorandum of understanding on the management of migratory flows. This is an agreement that marks a turning point in international relations and all the more so because Albania is not even a member of the European Union.
 </p>
<p>
  Italy pledges to pay 16.5 million euro in exchange for obtaining full jurisdiction over two areas in Albanian territory that will be occupied by Italian law enforcement agencies with the extension of our jurisdiction to non-European territory.
 </p>
<p>
  In these two areas, up to 36,000 migrants per year will be deported, at totally Italian costs, with a maximum of 3,000 per month; these are therefore two authentic concentration camps where refugees gathered at sea will be taken directly, without passing through Italy. Critical voices have been raised against this agreement in both countries, but these are mostly related to the lack of credibility of the operation.
 </p>
<p>
  Italy pledges to ‘repatriate’ up to 3,000 migrants per month from the territories of Albania under its jurisdiction, and the amount raises doubts as to whether the agreement really works. Beyond the criminal handling of the people picked up at sea and deported and confined in an unworthy manner in this Italian ‘colony’ abroad, there are other points to highlight.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialist Italy knows full well that it is thus putting its foot in its old protectorate, and it also knows full well that the management of these camps will require the emergency contracting out of a huge amount of services that will be tempting both unscrupulous entrepreneurs and the third sector and criminality in these two countries. From canteens to warehouses to logistics, care cooperatives etc… a sea of money injected in obscure ways will increase political instability and social tensions, racism and contradictions within a nation already fragile and exposed to corruption and open and widespread repression of any manifestation of opposition by the popular masses.
 </p>
<p>
  It is a policy aimed at enveloping the reactionary Albanian ultra-corrupt class even further into a thousand relations, not only economic and political but above all military, with Italy, with devastating results for the popular and proletarian strata of that country.
 </p>
<p>
  The agreement has already passed through the Albanian Constitutional Court, which had to examine the appeal lodged by 30 MPs challenging its legitimacy, while on 24 January, the Chamber of Deputies approved the bill to ratify and execute the Protocol with 155 votes in favour, 115 against and two abstentions, reflecting the internal tensions that this passage is creating.
 </p>
<p>
  When talking about the initiatives undertaken by Italian imperialism today, it is also necessary to recall the so-called ‘Mattei Plan’ for Africa. The Plan was presented on 28-29 January by the Meloni government, which organised the Italy-Africa summit in Rome attended by 46 international delegations and EU representatives. It is an attempt to organise in a coherent manner and under the direct control of the state various activities that have been ongoing for decades or are in the pipeline. Already today, to give just one example, Eni, Enel, Snam and Terna, which are the main Italian state-owned energy companies, are involved in various activities in Africa, just think of the management of the international gas pipelines connecting Algeria to Italy. However, this is yet another initiative taken by a country characterised by a limited possibility of strategic choices since it is subject to the substantial hegemony of countries such as the USA, Germany, France, and the UK, and which also operates under the continuous blackmail of European funding such as that allocated to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan ( PNRR ) destined to stop in 2026.
 </p>
<p>
  Italian imperialism in Africa today rests its feet on its colonial past and various wartime involvements with an infinite number of relationships woven over almost 200 years of history starting with the Kingdom of Italy, then Fascism and finally the Republic. Wherever and in whatever phase it has operated, massive economic interventions have been necessary to ensure a minimum of viability with enormous costs falling primarily on the popular and proletarian strata of our country.
 </p>
<p>
  Africa today represents an immense territory in which the interests of the major powers converge, ravaged by the oppression of these countries and thus by bureaucratic capitalism and the various forms of suppression and decomposition of semi-feudalism. This is why it is destined to be one of the terrains of the ongoing inter-imperialist clash and it is inevitable that Italy will be directly involved in it, even militarily. The Mattei plan, supported by meagre economic resources, represents an attempt to hold its own against the other main countries and once again shows the bombastic face of an imperialism as weak as it is viscerally warmongering, destined to run ruinously aground in the future.
 </p>
<p>
  Italy has also been particularly active in organising a military intervention in the Red Sea with France and Germany with the declared aim of defending international maritime traffic through the Suez Canal and then the Bab el-Mandeb Strait between Djibouti on the African coast and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. The threat would be posed by Yemen’s Houthi population and the ‘Aspides’ mission is scheduled to start on 19 February with Italy participating with two warships and reconnaissance aircraft. As is well known, the Houthis have declared that their intention is not to indiscriminately hit any ship passing through the strait, but only those to and from Israel in an attempt to defend the Palestinian population that is the target of the criminal aggression in Gaza. To date, it is, if anything, the intervention on the spot by the US and UK that has created the conditions for a threat to navigation with a state of war for all other ships, and it is for this reason that there are already several companies considering other routes with a significant increase in time and cost.
 </p>
<p>
  On the one hand, Italy is directly affected by the threat as it continues to maintain relations with Israel on all levels as demonstrated, for example, by the initiative just taken by the Palestinian human rights groups Adalah, Al Mezan, Al-Haq and PCHR, which have warned ENI against engaging in activities in the maritime areas of the Gaza Strip that belong to Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  On 29 October last, Israel granted an exploration licence in the waters off Gaza for the exploitation of a gas field that could yield 800 million dollars a year, but Israel does not recognise a Palestinian state and considers itself the holder of the rights. In the face of this looting, the associations put ENI at risk of becoming an accomplice in war crimes, unmasking even in this case the façade ‘humanitarian’ interventions undertaken by Italy in recent weeks by sending, for example, a hospital ship and the sheltering of a few Palestinian children among the thousands and thousands who are continuously massacred by the state of Israel with which it does business.
 </p>
<p>
  However, it is not so much a question of securing trade deals as it is of carving out a role for themselves in the ongoing inter-imperialist clash. The geographical area stretching from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf via the Horn of Africa is already referred to as the ‘extended Mediterranean’. This denomination implies that Italy cannot remain outside it if it wants to play a role among the great nations, the Mediterranean being the ‘mare nostrum’ par excellence [‘Mare nostrum’ was the Roman name for the Mediterranean Sea, the term was taken over by the Italian fascism].
 </p>
<p>
<br>
  Division Admiral Fabio Agostini, of the Interforce Summit Operations Command, stated in an interview with ‘laragione.eu’ that ‘we will certainly play a very active role’ and ‘the use of force will absolutely be in defence of national interests and Italian and European merchant traffic’.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said in a recent hearing that the Houthis represent a threat 10 times more dangerous than Hamas and that the problem is that while Italian and European traffic is being threatened there are countries like China and Russia that can transit freely and so in reality we are facing a hybrid war, ‘it is a matter that goes far beyond what is happening in the Red Sea’. On the other hand, it should be added that during Meloni’s recent visit to Tokyo, joint naval exercises were announced, and these are always simulations of the containment of China with the control of the straits that, for now, allow this country to transit goods around the world.
 </p>
<p>
  The Red Sea mission represents a very serious act in the direction of direct involvement of our country led by a fascist government towards open warfare!
 </p>
<p>
  By focusing on the alleged aspects of ‘lack of credibility’ and calling all these initiatives an ‘electoral spot’, one completely loses sight of the specific characteristics of Italian imperialism, which has always combined bombastic declarations and scenographic initiatives with insistent criminal interventions on the political, economic and military levels, confirming a historical characteristic that once again is not taken on board or is underestimated even by some honest anti-imperialists and anti-fascists in our country who stop at the most external and superficial manifestations without looking at the substance of Italian imperialist fascism!

</p>
<p>
   As a Palestinian reality in Italy we launch an appeal to all 
 individual workers and all unions to strike on Friday 23rd 
 February to stop the genocide.
  </p>
<p>
   Simple solidarity is no longer enough: the Italian government is 
 openly deployed with Israel, against hundreds of thousands of 
 people took to the streets in recent months. Only concrete actions can 
 force Meloni and his ministers to retire from a war in which 
  they are an active part with the
   <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
  propaganda, with the sale of weapons, with the 
 Commercial and academic agreements.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   We block Italy against the position of the government, of NATO, 
 of the European and western states that support the genocide that 
 Israel has been carrying out on October 7th and the colonial occupation that lasts 
 For over 75 years in Palestine.
  </p>
<p>
   The price of the war in the Middle East, as of the war in Ukraine e 
  of the "other peacekeeping missions" around the world, the 
 workers and unemployed, as always the last. War is one 
 catastrophe that we will find ourselves in the increase in the bill, in the cart 
 spending, in the increases of rents and transport.
  </p>
<p>
   We ask Arab workers, Muslims and foreigners not to turn 
 On the other hand: you have to be in the front row for our sisters e 
 brothers killed and imprisoned in Palestine, for those who are sacrificing themselves 
  In the fight against colonialism, for freedom and justice. Who 
 better than us he knows this struggle and hears it on his skin every 
 day? Racism is the tool that exploits us in the West and in 
 our countries torture us. From Italy we must not mobilize only in 
 rescue of our massacred people, who resist and will still resist: 
  Let's do it for us, let's mobilize because the governments that kill us 
 they are the same that sucking the blood and make your life 
 impossible and miserable; they are the same that remove the rights and 
 they reduce to hunger those who work, who close hospitals and schools, since 
  they still can't bomb them like their Israeli friends.
  </p>
<p>
   The unemployed also have to go down to us in the square because the state 
  Italian, who spends millions for weapons and to finance wars a 
 lost fund, it is the same as that has removed citizenship income and the 
  other social support devices, because unemployment is the 
 The result of a crisis that has one of its main causes in the war.
  </p>
<p>
   From 7 October the Palestinians, and the front of the resistance that from 
 Lebanon passes through Iraq and arrives at Yemen, they are giving a lesson to 
  World: the last can rewrite history, they can raise the 
 head and powerful can bleed.
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore we invite each union and every worker with conscience a 
 block the factories, ports, warehouses and everything you can 
 Until the genocide of a people who claim justice 
  And freedom.
  </p>
<p>
   Against the colonial and imperialist war
  </p>
<p>
   We block everything
  </p>
<p>
   We block the war car
  </p>
<p>
   With Palestine until victory!

    With great sadness we learn that his partner Concetta Musio left us this morning. For years, an active companion in the Slai Cobas and in the revolutionary proletarian feminist movement where he gave his best with generosity, combativeness, a spirit of rebellion. For this he was loved and respected by all his teammates and companions at national level and the entire movement in Taranto. In the last year his state of health has worsened, but every time he felt better he showed up and participated with his smile and his sweet anger, as in the garrison for Palestine last November. Now we are grieved and we just want to remember it with its best face. We greet his children warmly. It is not rhetoric to say that Concetta lives and fights with us.

    We must communicate a very bad news: our partner, Concetta Musio, a lot of active, until he has been able, especially in the MFPR, but also in communist proletarians, in the battles of the Slai Cobas, engaged not only in Taranto but also in national mobilizations, concept not c 'it's more.

    Concetta has always had to fight in his life, both in family relationships and in always precarious work, but always with rebellion, courage, strength, but also a smile; And once we joined us, this strength was his ideology, the hope of the revolution that led everywhere, to everyone.

    Hi Concetta, sweet warrior. That the earth is mild to you, like this system has not been with you at all. For this, for you too, we have to break down. For this reason, even with you, we will continue to fight, with your determination, with your anger, with your love, to free many other women from all this pain. And this will be the only way to do it justice. For you, for Anna, for all the proletarian companions that I was lucky enough to meet.

    I have no words, and not even more tears for now perhaps because I can't believe it. He left silently for me, but with a load of unbearable pain for her, who touched herself behind her smile, and her strength. I have no words, but only a lot of anger.

<strong>
   Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is currently in a high-security prison in the UK. The government will hand him out to the United States where he risks 175 years in prison. His only "crime" is that he, as a journalist, revealed the US war crimes.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  From 2012 to 2019, Assange lived in asylum in Ecuador's embassy in London, on the run from US imperialism. Assange is Australian citizen, and Australia has long asked for him to come to his home country. Nevertheless, the US allies in the United Kingdom and other European countries would rather extradite him to the United States, where he is charged with espionage and computer theft. The question to be dealt with by the Supreme Court is whether the government's decision to hand out Assange to the United States is legal.
 </p>
<p>
  Since 2019, when Ecuador invited British police into his embassy to arrest Assange, the journalist has sat in the UK's most notorious high -security prison. Here he lives under relationships that his wife and family strongly criticize. On February 20 and 21, his case was dealt with by the British Supreme Court in London, but Assange was too sick to participate. Before the asylum in Ecuador's embassy, Assange from Sweden escaped, where he was accused of sexual abuse - a case that was later closed.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Assange revealed war crimes
  </strong>
</h4>
<p>
  The reason for the persecution of Assange is that Wikileaks, where he was central, published a number of secret documents from the United States in 2010, several of which revealed the brutality of the imperialists in Iraq and Afghanistan. Particular attention received a video showing how the pilots in an Apache helicopter from the United States used their canon to kill two Iraqi Reuters journalists, Namir Noor-Eldeen (22) and Saeed Chmagh (40), and nine other men. Two children were also seriously injured in the attack. The United States subsequently covered the case.
 </p>
<p>
  In other words, Wikileaks not only exposed war crimes, but a direct attack on the right to conduct journalism. This bourgeois-democratic court is completely set aside not only by the United States in the case against Assange, but also by the US co-runners in countries such as Sweden and the United Kingdom. We see this in the context of the decay and crisis in the bourgeois political system, where democratic freedoms and rights are now systematically undermined.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Attack on journalists and press freedom
  </strong>
</h4>
<p>
  Assange's wife Stella Assange said outside the London court house: “There is an attack on journalists all over the world. It is an attack on the truth and an attack on the public's right to know. " The AP news agency believes it is likely that the Supreme Court will spend several weeks to make a decision - if Assange loser is handed out to the United States, which means he will die in captivity.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
<img alt="" class="wp-image-32937" decoding="async" height="520" sizes="(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px" src="https://tjen-folket.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.png" srcset="https://tjen-folket.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.png" width="1222"/>

<p>
  Norwegian PEN, the Norwegian department of "the world's largest writer and freedom of speech organization" Pen International, protests in a call against the process against Assange, and writes, among other things: "If Assange is handed over to the United States, the charges mean to equate journalistic revelations with espionage, because the actions As described in the charge are mainly forms of obtaining information that are common methods for journalists. This includes the discovery of the leaky, secretly stamped information. It will be the first time US authorities are using spy legislation against a publisher. ”
 </p>
<p>
  The case of Assange is just one of many examples of the complete lawlessness that prevails to those who the United States point out as their enemies. Liquidations, torture and captivity without law and judgment are methods they have often indicated, including the prisoners of Guantanamo. They kidnap systematically citizens from other countries, and keep them in captivity without being tried. Such cases are often legitimized with lying prices such as "the war on terror" or "the war on drugs". The Assange case shows that even bourgeois journalists do not have protection in this community. The attacks on freedom of the press are one of many expressions of the crisis in the bourgeois political system and the tendency towards open fascism.
 </p>
<p>
  Tragically and ironically, the trial in London takes place at the same time as Western media and authorities are in harsh that the Russian opposition Navalnij recently died in the hands of Russian imperialism.

  The CIE (Internment Center for Foreigners) are prisons created only and exclusively to retain foreigners “syneppers”, whose only crime is to come to a country in the way they can find a better life. Formally, the ICDs are places where the State brings together migrants who arrive in Spain irregularly, to expedite their expulsion - that is, the return to their countries of origin - while providing minimum services of maintenance of food and housing for satisfy your basic human rights. The reality is very different: the CIEs are prisons where the National Police torture and commits all kinds of humiliations and vexations against human dignity.

  The torture committed is so obvious and wild, and the National Police feel with such impunity, that some of these cases end up coming to light. The masses find a way to denounce it despite being in a situation of isolation, torture and harassment day after day. It is undeniable even by the bourgeois state itself, and the multiple complaints demonstrate it. And only the tip of the iceberg is visible. That's why

     “The heroic historical events have always been an important teaching for the revolutionaries of all generations. In this sense, our two countries have a lot to learn from it. (...)

Criminal prosecution and repression against progressive and revolutionary forces are something everyday these days. ... We have to combine the global working class against imperialism.

    Irene W., long -time activist of the autonomous women's movement, believes that the teachings of the February battles still have topicality in 1934, so that the reduction of social and democratic rights and the increase in police officers are increasing massively. To fight back and fight, requires a determined and broad approach, as Gerhard Mack (

     </span>
</span>

<span>
    ) emphasizes that those questions should be asked that can summarize different interests. Mack also presented the developments before February 1934 and drew essential pillars of the development of Austrofascism and the labor movement in the run -up to the fights.

    The 1934 February fights were preceded by years of fascination, the destruction of democratic and social rights, wage robbery and the massive increase in unemployment. Developing a consistent policy against the increasing attacks of the rulers also means today to defend the heroic defensive fight against Austrofascism in February 1934 and to apply the conclusions derived from it today, according to a representative of the campaign for democratic rights (

    ). And that means, among other things, that one should not wait, but have to begin to organize itself in the defense of democratic and social rights today.

    The question of the state was also discussed. At the time of Austrofascism, the entire state apparatus was used to resign against the defense against fascism. The state apparatus was used as an instrument against the fighters with media propaganda, emergency regulation law, the use of the Federal Army and finally the introduction of the state law. Even today there is no “neutral” state, but the state apparatus is still an instrument of the ruling classes - the panel participants agreed. Irene W. stated whether the population should be split with opinion dictation or certain forms of isolation policy. She also emphasized that consequences for the population, especially for women, were also enforced in periods of SP government participation.

    One should not be blinded by the so -called "anti -fascism" by the Greens and SPÖ. The so often used "never fascism" can only be seriously persecuted if the anti -fascist and revolutionary struggle also opposes the policy of the rulers. An audience participant criticized the liberal "left" and emphasized that important topics, such as fight against EU and NATO, should not be left to the right. In order to advance the revolutionary and democratic movement in Austria, the questions that make a broad merger possible must be taken up. Another message from the audience emphasized the need to create action units against the upcoming EU elections.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Today (yesterday), just as we are talking, the body of the 
 fifth worker who from Friday 16 February was under the 
 rubble of the construction site of what is the workers' massacre of Florence 
 for profit.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  According to the press, 
 among other things, they are still trying to understand, to identify the 
 presence of the workers. As the prosecutor wrote,
  <i>
   “
  </i>
<i>
   And
  </i>
<i>
   a situation
  </i>
<i>
   in which
  </i>
<i>
   There is the problem of 
 match the names to the bodies. Therefore a complex has also begun 
 identification activities on what remains of these poor people 
 workers, started with the help of experts and that requires skills 
 genetic specifications. Because
  </i>
<i>
   It is the C
  </i>
<i>
   now are 
 Really in dramatic conditions. "
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Only this should 
 to horrify and make us understand the system we live in, a system 
 in which in a huge construction site you do not know who is there even 
 working. But this is the mirror of the condition they want 
 Bring the whole working class, all workers. For this system 
 imperialist we are slaves and that leads us to die every day like 
 the slaves.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is true, like 
 denounces an inspector, that the "work has changed". But the work 
 has changed because it has adapted to the thirst for profit and 
 exploitation that led to deregulation on the spot of 
 Work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is good to put on 
 center, as has also been said here by the unions, that there is a 
 link between Bergamo and what happened in Florence.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Of course there is a 
 link! And the bond is what Bergamo/Brescia are a basin of 
 labor of
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 thousands of workers exploited and underpaid to black, 
 of which construction is one of the main centers. We take into account that a 
 Bergamo are among the most important national construction companies, 
 those, to understand each other, of the Master Percassi, and around there is 
 all an induced business and employment lenders, a basin of 
 corporal, of whom everyone is aware, made by the masters but 
 Also endorsed by the confederal unions.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  “
  <i>
   8 workers in 
 A work team, but employees of three different companies "
  </i>
  . AND 
 The journalist wonders: “Companies or manpower loans, 
 So corporals? " Because this is the problem: it cannot exist 
 a master of a company of 23 employees who claim to say, like 
 said that of the company Go Costruzioni, Mr. Ghezzi,
  <i>
   "the 
 My employees among the dead? I don't know "!
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  But let's go back to 
 premise, that is, that the work has changed. Let's see the situation in 
 particular in Bergamo, already reported since 2016 by the CISL, the union that today 
 It does not even do the 2 shameful hours of strike. They say these ******* 
 Bastards of the CISL that:

   And

  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">

 Union situation let's see what the work inspectorate says 
 Always on Bergamo:
  <i>
   “i
  </i>
<i>
   construction companies: for
  </i>
<i>
   l’
  </i>
<i>
   Inspectorate 
 of work the irregularity is the rule, the
  </i>
<i>
   80%
  </i>
<i>
</i>
<i>
   And
  </i>
<i>
   out -of -law according to the inspection carried out last year and 62% 
 companies do not respect the rules for safety. "
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Some short data 
 To give an idea of this immense situation:
  <i>
   5000 construction companies 
 inspected in 2021, of which the
  </i>
<i>
   80%
  </i>
<i>
   find irregular, 
 1605 businesses suspended in the first
  </i>
<i>
   3
  </i>
<i>
   months of the year
  </i>
<i>
   p
  </i>
<i>
   For 
 failure to comply with the safety rules, the 200 accidents one al 
 minute.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Clearly the thing 
 more scandalous is that these complaints come 
 Facted in the National Congress of Filca Cisl in Bergamo and the trade unionists knew very well the situation of irregularities. And then they come 
 justified, always in this national congress, by this sort 
 of national unity: institutions, labor inspectorate, unions 
 Connivents and masters ...
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Here's what he says 
 Vanessa Pesenti, president of Ance Bergamo, who reiterates
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   to be
  </span>
<i>
   "An unacceptable wound for the country and for each of us."
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  But fuck you, we 
 let's say! But how is it possible to find a solution 
 If these institutional tables do not break, this rubber wall, 
 that we find ourselves in the jobs when we look for, with difficulty, 
 to bring out what are the working conditions e 
 of exploitation! This applies to construction sites, but also applies to 
 factories, because within the jobs, in all places 
 of work are not the unions that would be the first they have to check, the representatives of the security workers are alone 
 Four white flies are the ones who do their job and I don't know if 
 Not even there are at the moment in Bergamo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  When our daily factory activity 
 comes out of the workplace and is reported in the bodies in charge - e 
 that we should intensify, organize, also through 
 an organization of superior struggle that is that of the network for the 
 Safety - What are we in front of us? What are in front of them 
 workers or combative unions trying to get these out 
 conditions? There are the rubber wall of the entities in charge, 
 of the Ausl, of the work inspectorates that every now and then 
 they denounce, like when the case as Florence breaks out, like so many 
 others, and then don't change anything anymore, because they do square between 
 of them the confederal unions, the masters and the various governments that do 
 they succeeded, including the last one, who have weakened any 
 I wait for safety. It is not enough to condemn
  <i>
   "changes 
 of the legislation that led to a deregulation in the chain 
 of contracts
  </i>
<i>
   ha
  </i>
<i>
   Description of security "
  </i>
  as 
 A union like CGIL says.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The problem is not 
 only this last government but is the whole system that must be put in 
 discussion and that's why a battle is needed 
 national, but a battle that starts in every single job 
 and which involves, in fact, from workers to the inspectors, come on 
 delegates, RLS, journalists, intellectuals, all those who 
 understand that this continuous massacre, this daily war in 
 jobs is the mirror of a putrefaction company that 
 it must be overturned in order to truly put the 
 Work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Because the problem 
 It is that capital makes work harmful, not the work itself.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  We have 
 started with these "invisible" workers of which you do not 
 He still knows the name now, and we want to say some things respect 
 to their working condition reported by the brothers and by 
 Family:
  <i>
   “Mohamed always worked. He lived in Bergamo - he explains 
 His brother - he told me that he started every morning with a van 
 led by others to reach the Florence site. Then in the evening 
 He returned home and then left the next morning. It was a hard work, 
 So he said, he didn't earn a lot, half money gave them to him 
 Regularly, the other half instead was in black.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Another story is 
 The one told by the brother of the Tunisian boy:
  <i>
   ”
  </i>
<i>
   a
  </i>
<i>
   veva 
 only 19 years old when he left Tunisia to come to 
 Italy. I remember that day, when he left our back ours 
 City, greeting our parents, was happy to leave. Volev
  </i>
<i>
   a
  </i>
<i>
   A different future, embarked on that ship and left. To that 
 time could be traveled freely between one bank and another of the 
 Mediterranean."
  </i>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This for 
 Closing is the link between Bergamo and Florence. With the government with the League, i 
 racists, the fascists, the masters feel more and more free of 
 take advantage of the workers more and more, but on the other hand there are these 
 other proletarians, these brothers of ours, so we must transform 
 This pain in anger and organization to respond to theirs 
 dead.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  So what 
 We are doing we summarized it before, what anyway 
 We will continue to do, as well as to bring the complaint to the places of 
 work and also to the initiatives to be held, is to bring 
 the need for the organization within jobs 
 Compared to the safety and battle to be done against it 
 exploitation but also that for having wage increases. 
 Because another central data is also that of hunger wages 
 of workers as well as that of precarious contracts.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  We must give 
 permanent signs of a daily struggle that cannot wait for the 
 Next massacre of workers.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  The Amazonian Front Organization of Mobilization in Defense of Indigenous Rights (FAMDDI) denounced, in a statement, the murder of the indigenous Tadeo Kulina, found dead by beating in the Amazonian capital. In a document signed “Who killed Tadeo Kulina?” The entity denounces the diffuse information about the case and the innovation of investigations compared to the incident.
 </p>
<p>
  Tadeo was 34 years old and lived in the Foz do Aldeia of the Country, in the municipality of Envira, about 1,200 km from the capital. According to the information he arrived in Manaus on February 1 and was following his pregnant wife at Ana Braga Maternity. The couple integrates an ethnicity of recent contact and little spoke of Portuguese. They did not receive any help from any organ in this trajectory.
 </p>
<p>
  The indigenous was found missing on February 13 and was found a few days later, already in the IML, killed after a beating session by unknown authors. According to the entity, the Bos that were held on the case, brought diffuse information:
 </p>
<p>
  “We were also omitted several information and some of them do not beat, even B.O. done, it is not detailing, ”says the entity.
 </p>
<p>
  Information collected by the local corresponding
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  They also indicate that their Kulina ethnicity relatives only learned of their disappearance seven days after the incident.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to the clear confusion of the PM about the case, agents of the indigenous special sanitary district also acted with negligence. The document reports that the agents even spread information from what indigenous people died while hallucinating. For Famddi, the situation is a reason for "indignation" as it "implies that it would be the fans [Tadeo]." This is absurd. ”
 </p>
<p>
  Faced with this crime, FAMDDI requires proper case investigation and the punishment not only from the executors, but also those who omitted themselves.
 </p>
<p>
  “Famddi claims that the murder of Tadeo Kulina is properly investigated, those directly responsible and by omission of their responsibilities to be identified and justice is performed in the face of the historical impunity that marks the act of justice on crimes committed against indigenous peoples in this country and In Amazonas, ”he says.

<p>
  Israeli police said the Palestinian combatants who carried out the operation were killed.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Internal Security Service (Shin Bet) identified the Palestinians as the two brothers Muhammad and Kazem Zawahra-from Al-Taamra village-and Ahmed Al-Wahsh from Zaatara, near Belém.
 </p>
<p>
  The al-Jazeera correspondent Walid Al-Quomari reported, citing Israeli sources that Palestinian armed men opened fire against an Israeli military control post near the village of Al-Za'im, east of occupied Jerusalem.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israelite occupation forces sent large reinforcements to the area and closed the roads.
 </p>
<p>
  According to Israeli channel 13, one of the aggressors deliberately crashed into a car to cause an accident, resulting in a traffic jam. Then three fighters went down and set fire to the vehicles with two M-16 rifles and a pistol, killing and hurting soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  The Municipality of Ma'ale ADUMIM appealed to the Israeli settlers to remain in their homes,
 </p>
<p>
  The shooting at the Military Control Post near Ma'ale Adumim took place days after a similar operation that occurred in the settlement of Kiryat Malachi, east of Ashdod, which resulted in the death of two Israelis.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Heroic Operation’
 </h4>
<p>
  The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas described the operation as “heroic”, considering it as a natural response to Israeli massacres and mass crimes in the Gaza and West Bank.
 </p>
<p>
  "The incursion of occupation in Jerusalem and its planning to prevent the faithful from coming to the Mosque de Al-Aqsa during Ramadão will not bring it security," Hamas said in a statement.

  According to the Ministry of Health of Gaza, 29,410 Palestinians were killed and 69,465 injured at the Israeli Genocide in Gaza, which began on October 7.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, at least 7,000 people are missing, presumably killed under the rubble of their homes throughout the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
<p>
  Palestinian and international organizations say most of those dead and injured are women and children.
 </p>
<p>
  Israel states that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-AQSA flood operation on October 7.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  More weapons
 </h4>
<p>
  Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said Israeli citizens will continue to receive weapons from the government.
 </p>
<p>
  Ben-Gvir called for the restriction of the freedom of circulation of Palestinians and the placement of even more barriers.
 </p>
<p>
  "The right to life of Jewish residents in the West Bank is more important than the freedom of movement of the residents of the Palestinian authority," said Ben-Gvir, according to the Times of Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  Another extreme right politician, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, demanded the approval of a plan for thousands of new housing units in Ma'ale Adumim and in nearby illegal colonates in response to Palestinian operation.
 </p>
<p>
  "The serious attack on Ma'ale Adumim must have a decisive security response, but also a response from the colonates," he wrote at X.
 </p>
<p>
  “I demand that the Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) take advantage of the Superior Planning Council and immediately take the plans for thousands of housing units in Ma'ale Adumim and throughout the region,” he continued.
 </p>
<p>
  Parallel to the War in the Gaza Strip, the Israelite army intensified its raids in cities, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank, killing hundreds of people and holding more than 7,000 civilians.

<strong>
   Writing Note:
  </strong>
  Below is a text produced by the Al-Qassam Brigades, the Military Organization of Hamas, about the locally manufactured precision rifle in Palestine, the Ghoul rifle, and used extensively since the beginning of Operation Al-AQSA. The text was released in groups of Telegram of the Palestinian National Resistance and translated by

<p>
  The brigades Izz El-Din al-Qassam, the military wing of the Islamic resistance movement “Hamas”, consistently immortalized the names of their great leaders in the memory of the Palestinian struggle over decades, as their sacrifices and significant contributions marked A milestone in the history of the struggle against the Zionist occupant enemy, advancing the project of liberation in Palestine towards innovation and production of new military tools and skills to face the Zionist occupation supported by all evil forces in the world.
 </p>
<p>
  The name “Ghoul” emerged from the early days of the Zionist earthly aggression in the Gaza Strip, when the al-Qassam brigades announced several operations of fasteners who targeted the officers and soldiers of the occupation in various axes of raid in the range of range Gaza with the Qassami Ghoul rifle. Al-Qasam's francs showed great skill and extreme accuracy by reaping their heads, dropping them dead in various battlefields in the Gaza Strip.

  Ghoul rifle specifications
 </h4>
<p>
  The Ghoul rifle is known for its effective impact, range and mira accurate, with a lethal range of about 1,500 meters, using 12.7 mm caliber ammunition and a length of 1.5 meters.
 </p>
<p>
  It is considered one of the world's advanced accuracy rifles in terms of lethal range and caliber of ammunition, compared to the 7.62 mm Dragunov Russian rifle and 1,200 -meter lethal range, and the Steyr Austrian Precision Rifle with 12 , 7 mm and lethal range of 1,500 meters.
 </p>
<p>
  The rifle has demonstrated great capacity and high efficacy, generating widespread reactions in recent weeks, after military reports published by al-Qassam brigades and documented by military media lenses about their use by Al-Qassam with high proficiency against officers. and soldiers of the occupation.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The first ad
 </h4>
<p>
  Leader engineer Adnan al-Ghoul students honored their teacher, continuing their way and following their approach. They insisted on recording their name on an exclusive accuracy rifle that refers to the necks of usurper Zionists and instills terror in the hearts of criminal soldiers, as well as their teacher “Abu Bilal” did before their martyrdom, because in 2014 the brigades al -Sams they announced one of the surprises of the al-Qassami industries, produced locally by their fighters.
 </p>
<p>
  Al-Qassam brigades revealed the Ghoul precision rifle for the Battle of ASF Al-Ma'koul in 2014, which lasted 51 days between Palestinian resistance and the occupation army in the Gaza Strip, after the snipers of Al-Qassam's elite have performed several accurate and successful elite sniper operations against freshly distance tionist soldiers, as shown in videos of soldiers' elite shooter operations during land raid on the Gaza strip.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Important participation
 </h4>
<p>
  The brigades also revealed a complex safety operation called “al-i'ama” [“blinding”], performed by al-Qassam fasteners during the battle of Saif Al-QUs [“Al-QUD Sword”] 2021, targeting the observation and surveillance towers of the occupation throughout the Gaza's oriental boundaries with the lands occupied, significantly interrupting the movements of the occupation along the days of the Battle of Saif Al-QUDs.
 </p>
<p>
  The scenes showed al-Qassam, attacking the Zionist surveillance systems on the Gaza Strip Eastern borders with precise qualitative operations using Al-Qassam Ghoul rifles in the early hours of the battle, destroying several of them with direct and precise attacks, doing with which Zionist surveillance and observation systems were out of service.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The ghoul during the flood of al-aqsa
 </h4>
<p>
  The name of the precision rifle al-Qassam Ghoul resurfaced during the al-Aqsa Flood battle amid land aggression and the occupation army raids in various areas of the Gaza Strip. Since the beginning of the al-Aqsa Flood battle, the al-Qassam brigades have published 30 military reports, including 57 french-artist missions, 34 of which were carried out with the Qassami Ghoul rifle, resulting in the deaths of dozens of soldiers and occupation officers in various combat axes within the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
<p>
  The Military Press of the al-Qassam brigades has transmitted several elite shooter operations video clips, carried out with great skill and accuracy in different battlefields. One of the clips showed the slaughter of a Zionist officer with the Ghoul Qassami rifle east of the Jabalia Campo in the north of the Gaza Strip, and his death inside the tank.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-video">

<div aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer" style="height:25px">
</div>
<p>
  Another clip showed a Al-Qassam Flisther-or-a-ranker one of the enemy's fasteners in a building while he shot his civilian victims in the area of Talhawa, southwest of the city of Gaza, while other scenes showed Franco -Al-Qassam reporter accurately selecting its target, choosing one of the enemy's officers in a group of soldiers in the university area, west of the city of Gaza, and killing it.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Field operations and precision shots
 </h4>
<p>
  In the areas where the occupation said it had ensured control in the north of the Gaza Strip and in the city of Gaza, it was evident the escalation of the field operations performed by the formations and specialties of the al-Qassam brigades, notably the snipping, in addition to the weapons of Artillery and anti -Tank, surrounding the enemy's soldiers and vehicle positioning areas in the north of the Gaza Valley.
 </p>
<p>
  The redistribution of al-Qassam combatants has been evident through the operations of elite shooters performed by Al-Qassam shooters in the south of the city of Gaza, making the Occupation Officers and Soldiers the favorite hunting of snipers of the Al-Qassam, who perform their deadly operations in just a few minutes before they retreat from their current positions in search of another prey in a different area.
 </p>
<p>
  Maintaining land possession is the most important factor in deciding battle, not its occupation or temporary control. History and the recent past tell us that victory is combined with the just cause and the larger breath, which is certainly the owner of the earth and not its occupant.
 </p>
<p>
  Al-Qassam's creativity in the countryside was preceded by the creativity of Al-Qassam's minds and pulses in military workshops and laboratories, where the minds and inventions of military manufacturing fighters have converged from the beginning to this day. In a gesture of loyalty to the faithful, the names of our leaders were immortalized in our local industries, through which we reap the heads of the Zionist aggressors.

   The Palestinian genocide continues by the fascist-Zionist state of Israel with the full coverage of the US and European imperialists. The 30,000 are touched by the recorded dead! Thousands of injuries and an unknown number overwhelmed under the ruins! At the same time that hunger, thirst and illness reap those who escape the bombings, Israel is preparing to intervene with land forces in Rafa, where it has displaced over 1,000,000 Palestinian civilians, supposed to be "safe". The Nazi atrocities in repeat! At the same time, mass arrests, houses, murders, and the fierce blow to the demonstrations await the Palestinians in the western "Massively resist and express their opposition to the raid on Gaza.

   The imperialists will not hesitate to open another regional war if it serves their interests!
   <b>
    The US and Great Britain are bombarding Yemen's cities by escalating the conflict in the region. Close up is the European Union that sends warships to the Red Sea under the pseudonym ASPIDES in order to have a say in any "sharing".

<span style="font-family: arial;">
   In the face of this dangerous situation for peoples, the ND government, and the system parties say they are willing to stand in the interests of the imperialists. They are politically and militarily supported by Israel's fascist-Zionist state in the crime he commits against the Palestinian people. The country has been transformed into an advanced US-NATO prison, on a vast basis for the sake of their deadly weapons from Souda to Alexandroupolis.
   <b>
    The government is escalating the country's involvement in the war by sending the frigate "Hydra" to the Red Sea and taking over the administration of the frigates that will be sent there. He has already stated that he will participate with another frigate in US -UK war operations. The country's unmistakable bourgeoisie of the country to "satisfy" its Motoropathies drags the people and the country on dangerous roads. It scatters billions in equipment programs, while it reserves for workers, youth, the people as a whole, poverty, poverty and life without rights.

And the reason for the Yankee refusal, Bolsonaro himself said at his ministerial meeting: "If we react after the elections, there will be chaos in Brazil, it will become a great guerrilla!" It is the fear of the revolution.

  Today, Jair Bolsonaro and 22 more investigated for coup attempted coup d'état were forced to give testimony to the PF. Among these, the large amount of high military officers reaffirms to be, from the very essence of the Armed Forces, the inclination to military interventions. Braga Neto, four-star reserve general, former defense minister and candidate for deputy in 2022; Augusto Heleno, General of the GSI former Minister-Chief Reserve; Paulo Sérgio Nogueira, general of the former army commander and former defense minister; Almir Garnier, former Navy commander Admiral, as well as three other army colonels. There is also Valdemar Costa Neto, PL President Anderson Torres, former Justice Minister and former Bolsonaro advisors.
 </p>
<p>
  Neither Bolsonaro, nor any of the other generals responded to the investigators' inquiries, because, in fact, their situation is, in their own way and level, legally delicate. Even before the recent release of the video of the meeting between Bolsonaro, ministers and generals, the notably coup performance of the accused was already known. Since last year, information had already proven that Braga Netto participated in meetings with Bolsonaro where the scam was discussed, with the high command of the Armed Forces, which discussed the outbreak of a “state of defense” and that He visited Bolsonarist camps to appeal that the "green chickens" wouldn't be discouraged. Heleno also had close proximity to the Bolsanist Success, and received several of them while he was Minister of GSI. In Mauro Cid's allegations, he was one of those pointed out as a connoisseur or even a participant in the far right coup articulations. Paulo Sérgio Nogueira, as revealed last year, personally received the
  <em>

  </em>
  Walter Delgatti at the Ministry of Defense to draw plans to demoralize the electronic ballot boxes from the far right plans. Almir Garnier, lastly, was one of the generals who agreed to command troops in a possible attempted blow by Bolsonaro. Again: All of this was known before the recent revelations, which brought new proof of Braga Neto's coup performance (articulator of the general's demoralization campaign that denied participating in an open blow), Augusto Heleno (who proposed to “turn the table before the elections ”) And Paulo Sérgio (who delayed, on purpose, the dissemination of the Ministry of Defense report on“ ballot box security ”, in the objective of generating chaos).
 </p>
<p>
  In the case of Bolsonaro, it is already known that, on November 19, 2022, therefore 20 days after the end of the second round, received in the presidential palace his former advisor to international affairs, Filipe Martins, as well as lawyer Amauri Saad and the Father José Eduardo de Oliveira e Silva. According to whistleblower Mauro Cid, Martins presented to Bolsonaro the decree (the “draft”), and received from this the adjustments guidelines, to wipe the text and remove some points. On December 7, these new meeting, but now with two of the Armed Forces Commanders: Freire Gomes (Army) and Garnier Santos (Navy). Two days later, December 9, according to the investigation, Bolsonaro approved the changes in the draft and met with General Theophilo Gaspar de Oliveira, commander of terrestrial operations, who placed the orders to execute the military coup if he received the orders. As it turns out, investigations directly imply Bolsonaro in such a draft. What would he have to say about this, under these circumstances?
 </p>
<p>
  The most important and inaugural preparatory act of Bolsonaro took place on July 5, 2022, at such a ministerial meeting in which Bolsonaro gives the directive, that all his ministers should doubt the electoral process. In May, two months earlier, the reactionary armed forces participated in the electoral transparency commission and already exemplary this task: then defense minister Paulo Nogueira, raised 88 questions about the “urn security”, and with the approval of all The commanders of the Armed Forces, the "Legalists" and the "Bolsonarists." "Legalists" who, in November, spoke defending the camps in front of the barracks as "democratic manifestations", while the sudden "green chickens" asked for military coup. These are the legalistic military!
 </p>
<p>
  Let us also recall that it was on December 9 that Bolsonaro "broke the silence" after the defeat, the same day he would have approved the final newsroom of the "draft." In his first intervention after the defeat, Bolsonaro explicitly prepared the ground for his Armageddon. “I am sure that, among my functions guaranteed in the Constitution, is to be the supreme chief of the Armed Forces. The Armed Forces are essential in any country in the world. He has always said, over these four years, that the Armed Forces are the last obstacle to socialism. ” Bolsonaro here clearly externalized the conflict and internal struggle that was bursting within the Military High Command, about intervening or not
  <em>
   that moment
  </em>
  e
  <em>
   that
  </em>
  . The only unanimity that we are aware that there is all of them is that the intervention option is always on the table, otherwise there would be no discussions.
 </p>
<p>
  Defeated within the High Command, Bolsonaro and his group played to take place the second Bolsonada on January 8, preceded by the general essay, on November 15, the day of the new president's diplomation. Major Rafael Martins and whistleblower Mauro Cid has made transactions, $ 100,000, to fund hotel, food and "protesters" passages to Brasilia, on November 14. The next day, the "green chickens" starred in the first violent protest by a coup in the capital. On January 8, some detainees revealed that men prepared in advance instructed the crowd on how to behave during the action, which raises the suspicion of participation of specialists, unconventional wars. General Rudauto Lúcio Fernandes is suspected of participating in this scheme. Now, more and more, everything fits.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the expectations of Bolsonaro's arrest rise. In response, he summoned the act on February 25, which must have more than 80 deputies and governors of the far right and those who attacked their wagon to the pocket car. We will see what will be the next movement of the Mato Captain. But there is no doubt, throughout public opinion, that Bolsonaro was the head of scammers preparations. It is also noteworthy that these did not result in effective action because Yankee imperialism did not accept the initiative now; And that was only why the military summit was divided. And the reason for the Yankee refusal, Bolsonaro himself said at his ministerial meeting: "If we react after the elections, there will be chaos in Brazil, it will become a great guerrilla!" It is the fear of the revolution.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  So far, no surprise
 </h3>
<p>
  Nothing that is revealed so far surprises this podium, but that makes choir with all its analysis.
 </p>
<p>
  On May 17, 2022, in the editorial
  <strong>
   Military Crisis Discourses
  </strong>
  , we pointed to the heat of the events that Bolsonaro headed the most serious rupture preparations relying on the conflict with the Supreme Court and having the center the electoral issue:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   “Bolsonaro, as is constituted, follows his coup agitation. The target of it is the reactionary armed forces troops and their auxiliary forces, mainly, and public opinion in the background. The objective is to shake the barracks alleging institutional crisis as an STF interference in the executive's competences (see Daniel Silveira crisis), as alleged proof of bias of the Supreme Court in favor of the election of Luiz Inácio. Election that, for him, would be the 'restart' of the country's 'communication' and proof that the state is 'co -opted' by the PT - and in this case, to install the FA to intervene to 'guarantee the constitutional powers', being this One of the missions that the 'citizen constitution' of 1988 attributes them. Bolsonaro's coup action plan is therefore to use as a battle -horse the issue of the ballot box as the final proof of their statements, destabilize and, perhaps, break the Hierarchy of the FA and auxiliary forces at some more fragile, forcing high Command of the Armed Forces (ACFA) to embark on the culmination of the military coup, impose a new regime and, within it, to continue the pugna by defining what type of regime it would be. Thus, all the pocket agitation seeks to increase the threat atmosphere of an imminent Armageddon, as much as blackmail that prevents a possible election of Luiz Inacio, and to enhance the coup frenzy to culminate him if he wins. ”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  As for Paulo Sérgio Nogueira, in the same editorial, we will unmask the role he was fulfilling in the election transparency commission:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   “Paulo Sérgio Nogueira, the current defense minister who lifts the Supreme Court with questions and demands skewed with a clear purpose of questioning the election - a man who until the other day was an active General - is the same one that was celebrated by the stupid liberals of the press monopoly when he assumed the general command of the army. ”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  We also pointed out that Yankee imperialism tended not to allow an institutional rupture and that such “legalists” within the Armed Forces were only with this position, as a result of the position of imperialism:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   “Yankee imperialism is not interested in greater shaking in its backyard in times of crisis and so growing international tensions. Generals are evidently scammers, but they want to conduct their offensive offensive preventive counter-revolutionary as much as possible in legality and not precipitate the culmination of the coup: they want to lead it through the electoral farce and the old decrepit democracy, destroying it as it exists today, with followed stocked, and establishing, with its moderating power through current institutional instruments, a new political regime of absolutist presidentialism. Its pronouncements, all questioning the electronic ballot box, is to prepare conditions of military intervention supported by article 142 if the situation is extreme - for the eventual effect that has the pocket preaching and the growth of the general crisis and the revolutionary situation that develops, since those Popular rebellions of 2013/14 - to the point of being required to intervene so as not to lose control, with this point a constitutional justification. But mainly, their scammers against the ballot box are more rhetorical, they are a measure to dispute with Bolsonaro control over the troop. ”

 Junker, Prussian or landowner of slow evolution of semi -feudality, of the 
 Another route, the Farmer route of destruction of the landowner and fast system 
 development of capitalism; as well as to differentiate countries 
 developed (now imperialist) capitalists of the semi -feudal countries and 
 semicolonial on whose base a bureaucratic capitalism develops. As 
 It is seen in North America. In Lenin's study, capitalism in the agriculture is going 
 imposing displacing extensive agriculture by intensive agriculture, 
 small by the surface it occupies compared to the extensive, but 
 "Great" for the amount of invested capital and the use of wage labor.

    At the time of imperialism, in its last phase, in the 
 moment of its greatest decomposition, when this is even more monopoly, more 
 parasitarian and more rotten, it exports its capitals to our countries to 
 monopolize the land, directly or through its economic agents the 
 landowners and the great native bourgeois (great "modern" estates) 
 And so with low capital investment compared to what they would need to 
 produce in the imperialist countries themselves practice agriculture 
 extensive, which strips the peasantry, ruins the land for production

 Guide production not to the national market but to the world market (market

    For this section, agricultural census data were collected 
 Recent from six important Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, 
 Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. The type and amount of data collected 
 In the census of each country they vary considerably and, therefore, the 
 Depth of the analysis is limited by the availability of the data. By 
 This reason, the attention will focus mainly on Brazil and Peru, who have 
 The most detailed data, and will include only limited data from Colombia,

 Predomination of great landowners in these countries. Despite the 
 frequent statements over the years that great estates 
 They would disappear due to their inefficiency and inability to compete with 
 Small and medium more productive producers, this does not seem to be the case. 
 As Table 1 shows, the large properties of 500 hectares or more occupy 
 Most agricultural lands in all countries studied, note to 
 Page 3 and the highest properties of more than 1,000 hectares occupy almost 
 half of all agricultural lands in Brazil and Venezuela, more than two 
 -Tercios in Peru and three quarters of all agricultural lands in 
 Argentina and Colombia.

    In other words, although the concentration of the earth has 
 decreased in some places in recent years, it is still extreme in the 
 most of the main Latin American countries, and the countryside is still 
 dominated by great landowners. However, it should be noted that there are 
 Significant differences between countries and within them. In some 
 Countries, like Chile, the great unproductive estates are practically 
 non -existent (Bengoabengoa reference 2013), while in other countries, such as 
 Colombia are omnipresent. There are also significant differences 
 From one region from one country to another. The northeast of Brazil, for example, has a 
 significantly different agrarian structure from that of the south or southeast of 
 Brazil, and these differences should not be overlooked.

    In addition, concentrated property and predominance of great 
 properties do not necessarily mean that the earth is underutilized or that 
 It operates under a logic of risk minimization. In some regions, 
 large farms are used for mechanized intensive agriculture, and 
 In many Latin American countries, agriculture areas have been developed 
 highly productive. In fact, countries like Brazil and Argentina have 
 experienced an important boom in soybean production in recent years, 
 and much of this production is carried out in mechanized farms of large 
 size.

<span>
<span>
    Therefore, to have an idea of the relative weight of the 
 large mechanized farms compared to other forms of production 
 Less intensive, I look for data on the use of the specific land of 
 Great farms. Figure 1 shows the use of land in large 
 Properties in Brazil, Colombia and Peru, the only countries for which 
 had data on the use of the specific land of the size of the 
 farms These properties are almost entirely dominated by 
 extensive activities such as grazing and forests, and more than 80 percent 
 of the land they occupy is dedicated to these two activities, while only 
 A small portion is used for cultivation. This seems to be the case too 
 For other countries, since the data on the general use of the land 
 They reflect this same general pattern. AND
    <u>
     n other words, although it is true that in 
 Some regions large properties are used for intensive crops, 
 The general trend is clearly the opposite: in the great farms of 
 Latin America predominate extensive activities such as grazing and 
 forests.

    Not only do extensive activities predominate, but 
 Statistics on Earth use reveal low investment and low productivity 
 of these types of production. In grazing lands, for example, if 
 We divide the total number of animals into large farms by the total 
 hectares of pastures, the large farms in Brazil have only 0.65 animals per 
 hectare of grazing land, while in Peru it is incredibly low, 
 0.06 animals per hectare (IBGE 2012; INEI 2012). This means that these 
 landowners averages much less than one animal for each hectare of land 
 grazing, while small properties can have between 2 and 10 
 animals per hectare. In Peru, small farms of less than 
 fifty hectares average 12 animals per hectare of grazing land, 
 approximately two hundred times more than the great properties of the country (INEI 
 2012).

 An idea of how prevalent are the various technologies throughout the sector

     Brazilian census data on production and investment 
 They provide another indication of the low productivity logic of the great

    . Although the large farms of five hundred hectares or more occupy the 
 56 percent of all agricultural lands in Brazil, represent only 36 
 percent of the total production value and represent only 43 percent 
 of total investment (IBGE 2012). This contrasts markedly with small 
 farms of less than fifty hectares, which occupy only 13 percent 
 of the Earth but represent 35 percent of the total value of production 
 and 28 percent of the total investment.
    <u>
     In other words, great farms 
 They occupy more than four times more land than the little ones, but they have only a 1 
 percent more total production value and only 15 percent more than 
 total inversion.
    </u>
    These findings are also supported by information from the 
 Brazil Agrarian Reform Agency, which reported in 2010 that more than 50 for 
 one hundred of all great properties and 72 percent of all lands 
 occupied by large properties were considered “unproductive” according to 
 Agency parameters (Incra 2011). Footnote5

    Thus, despite the limitations of census data 
 agricultural, we can confirm that agricultural structures in these countries 
 They continue to be characterized by an extreme concentration of the earth and are 
 dominated by large properties that use low production strategies 
 investment and low productivity. What gives rise to this situation, I maintain, is 
 The prevalence of land appropriation based on portfolio and relationships 
 of the resulting property, which exempt the great owners of the 
 market pressures to maximize the productivity of its properties. Without 
 However, detailed information about appropriation can rarely be found 
 of land in the data of the agricultural census, so I turn to the 
 Secondary literature in search of evidence of this. ”

      Monday

 inauguration of the academic year of the University for Foreigners of 
 Siena, contesting the minister of the University and Research.

      The 
  Committee activists, including some students of the University for 
 foreigners of Siena, after having exposed Palestinian flags and signs 
 invoked the end of the genocide, they contested to Minister Bernini 
 the complicity of the government in the genocide of the Palestinian people, 
 asking for the immediate end of any academic relationship with 
 Israeli University, participate in the employment system and 
 Apartheid in occupied Palestine.

      To the 
  Rector Tomaso Montanari, the Committee reiterated how the position from 
 he expressed on university boycott does not take into account on the one hand 
 of the historical context, if we want to call the genocide in place by 
  1949 to today, and on the other of the role of the Israeli universities in 
 system of apartheid and exploitation of Palestine.

  We believe it is useful to take part in a blow and media response that 
 Start from the social networks, yesterday we posed concrete problems for the rector, 
 And it is on what we can accept a comparison. We are therefore not 
 opposed to discuss the reasons for which it is necessary to break 
 Even academic and research agreements with Israel. However, we are 
 people who study every day, work or must still 
 worry every day for the next day, our time is 
 usefully employed if it can affect the reality of the facts. Until today 
  The rector Montanari reiterated his unavailability to terminate 
 The agreements, in fact undermining every basis of dialogue. The mass in 
 public discussion of this position, namely the declaration 
 to be available to consider the requests of the 
 Palestinian people, it is therefore an indispensable premise to sit down to a 
 discussion table ".

     On 
  This we mention the Pacbi guidelines (Palestinian Campaign for the 
 Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel) of the BDS movement 
 (Boycott, divestment and penalties), which are certainly 
 exhaustive: 'Academic institutions are a key point of the 
 ideological and institutional structure of the oppression regime, 
 Colonialism and Apartheid of Israel against the Palestinian population. 
 Since its foundation, the Israeli academy has written its 
 destiny with the political-military establishment in Israel, e 
 Despite the efforts of a handful of academics of principle, 
 The Israeli Academy is deeply implicated in the support and in the 
 perpetuation of the systematic refusal of Israel of the rights of 
 Palestinians'.

<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">

     "As 
  general imperative rule, all academic institutions 
 Israeli, unless proven otherwise, are subject to boycott, a 
 due to their ten -year, profound and conscious complicity in 
 perpetrate the Israeli employment and the denial of rights 
 fundamentals of the Palestinians, both through their silence, and 
 represents an effective involvement aimed at justifying, hiding or 
  otherwise deliberately diverting attention from violations 
 Israeli of international law and human rights, or even 
  through their direct collaboration with state agencies in the 
 planning and in the realization of projects that violate the law 
 international and the rights of the Palestinians. Consequently, these 
 institutions, all their activities, and all activities that 
 They sponsor or support must be boycotted. You should 
 put an end to all projects with Israeli academic institutions, 
  as it was with the South African academic institutions below 
 The apartheid ".

   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     AND 
  evident that for the Israeli console any not aligned item 
 It is dangerous and should be repressed. But it is understandable, because so 
 It works in Israel, whose government is imposing violently, both at 
  interior that at the outside of the country, the consent towards the 
 extermination of the Palestinian people. Among other things, the console, in his 
 declarations, makes an operation, this yes, very serious: superimposes 
 Zionism and Judaism, then alluding to anti -Jewish measures 
 Nazi -fascist, to try to confuse today's torturers with the 
 Victims of yesterday.

     This 
  For us it is offensive towards the memory of that immense 
 tragedy that were racial laws and the holocaust. The console, 
 In short, it climbs awkwardly and dangerously on the mirrors for 
 support those who are making a vast ethnic cleaning 
 proportions. We, on the other hand, very simply, are on the side of whom 
 Also in these hours it is killed under the Israeli bombs with the 
 complicity of our institutions. It is necessary to do everything that 
  The genocide stops and Palestine is freedom from colonialism

     From 
  five months the committee was formed, but for many of us this 
 Battaglia started a long time before. The Committee claims continuity 
 with struggles in solidarity with the Palestinian people who for decades yes 
 they carry out in Italy. It seems absurd to us to remember again that the 
 current situation was not born on 7/10/2023, but determined by 
 A now secular colonial expression.

<span>
     Here 
  There is also the reply to the question asked: nobody within the arch 
 parliamentary ventures to deny Israel the right to defend 
 employment, oppression and apartheid towards Palestine and i 
 Palestinians. The distance between these parties, from Brothers of Italy to 
 Italian left, and what we see and do in the squares, in the 
 university and also on jobs (for example, remember for example 
 protests and blocks in different Italian ports against the transport of 
 weapons towards Israel) is unbridgeable and explains well the reasons for that 40% of 
 Italians who have no interest in sanctioning the choices with his own vote 
 NATO and European Union policies.

<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     View 
  We are not expecting the situation that the institutions, occupied by such 
 subjects, are convinced of the goodness of our positions. Our 
 solidarity with the Palestinian resistance is not only human, but it derives 
 From the fact that we share the same enemy: that block of power 
 Eurotlantic and imperialist who in Palestine finances a genocide, 
 While in Italy the people are silent, gathering the criticism and 
 repressing dissent. Our main interlocutors are the 
 Italians who do not bend to accept to be accomplices of the 
 genocide. If the spectators get up, puppets must also 
 stop doing theater ”.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  On the one hand, the fall in participation observed in the general meetings of the previous and this week also had the corresponding way on the road, which also contributes to the start of semesters in many schools, through telecommunications, in an effort by the system to create Conditions of intensification, "regularity" and repression of the struggle given by students, without "needing" to repeat matte raids to all schools, as in law.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  On the other hand, a potential world, about a thousand and more students and students, continues Thursday's "appointment", consolidates its position on the road and insists to resist the government's class policy, which is very important for the development of the struggle.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Also on the positives of the demonstration, the fact that the march was moving uniform, with the banner of the AUTH Student Association at the head and with all the club blocks following the same itinerary, although the FS. In a KNE-Aris frame, they chose to leave a distinct gap from the rest of the protesters.

 It is difficult in times like ours, in our country where bourgeois ideology dominates more and more in the worker movement; And in different forms they contribute to this domain in the majority trade union organizations all the parties of the parliamentary arch and most of those who distinguish themselves from them but who remain on the ground of reformism.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult to affirm and practice Leninism and the simple, and at the same time profound, observations that Lenin makes in the steps of his writings published last week.
 </p>
<p>
  It is difficult in this context to form communist paintings, workers' avant -garde that have the courage and ability to go against the current.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   But this is absolutely necessary. And at the same time it is necessary to do it with revolutionary optimism,
  </b>
  Since, however, see it or think, the facts and objective developments of daily reality are there to demonstrate that the reality of the class and the masses goes in a completely different direction of dominant ideas, of the politics, culture and action of the parliamentary parties and trade union organizations
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 majority confederal.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  There is no problem of the daily life of workers and workers who can be solved by the policies of current governments. The problems of work, the problems of salary, the problems of the deaths at work, the problems apparently external to the factory and instead of work, of school, health, transport, house, etc., they do not have one can have one Solution from these bourgeois governments.
 </p>
<p>
  And, therefore, the spontaneous approach, even when it translates into struggles, workers and popular masses to these problems does not produce any solution of them in almost all cases; Indeed, the spontaneous approach even when it translates into struggles certifies the fact that these problems cannot be solved; And the natural consequence of the spontaneous movement is at this point to adapt to reality, or to the dominion of bourgeois governments, and produces non -class consciousness but distrust in struggle and change.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   Therefore, the "spontaneous" struggle actually contradicts the equally spontaneous, even if confused and generic, aspiration for revolutionary change,
  </b>
  contradicts the inevitable, scientific main trend in today's society to a social and political revolution that abolishes the state of existing things.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   It is on this that Lenin's attention and indication is concentrated in the "What to do?".
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Without socialist theory that "determines the causes of the ailments of the working class", without assimilation of this theory, program, consequent political action, it is impossible for the class and for the masses to find the way for a real alternative, and to direct to the pursuit of This path is the struggle you do or that you want to do.
 </p>
<p>
  This point is not a final point of a spontaneous process of the action of the consciousness of workers and masses, but
  <b>
   It is an initial point of the communist organization of the worker avant -garde who wants to change the state of existing affairs,
  </b>
  First of all in the ranks of the class and subsequently, leveraging it, in the general movement of the proletariat.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   For this reason, it is first of all to the communists and the workers' avant -garde change their "theory" and their practice
  </b>
  In order to change, in a dynamic, the movement of the class, the relationships of strength.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   It is certainly not enough to affirm the "primacy of political action on trade union action", without indicating which policy we are talking about and what stage is the communist organization and the avant -garde worker and proletarian
  </b>
  Generally understood, to find the teenage of the skein and decide what to do.
 </p>
<p>
  Here too the theoretical and programmatic elements, propaganda and agitation, should not be sought in the sky of ideas, but descending in the "earth" of the problems of the daily life of the workers and masses and showing that none of them can be resolved without a General reversal of governments, of the states of the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
<p>
  This does not ask a simple and only "explanation" but a concrete struggle against the solutions or false solutions placed and imposed by the forces acting in the ranks of the class and of the masses.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, in the current stadium the capitalist and imperialist system, its states, its governments bind the solution of the problems to the general framework - see today the tendency to war -, to the transformation of the problems and movements of the masses into public order problems, By equipping the state to affect and repress both the proletarian struggles, even more when they inevitably do not achieve their objectives and refl are, during their development.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, escaping from the state of existing affairs, deviating spontaneity and spontaneous course means for the proletarian avant -garde and the communist organization proposing, "imposing" political action on this ground, which is itself in a certain formative extent of A political consciousness of class, towards the revolution and socialism.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   Basically, what is our main task?
  </b>
  Guide the economic struggle, to give spontaneity a value already of political consciousness? Or affirm theory, propaganda, agitation, organization capable of acting and handling this situation.
 </p>
<p>
  Manage means affirming in the theoretical action and in the daily political practice that the interests "essential, decisive classes can be satisfied only with radical political transformations in general and that the fundamental economic interest of the proletariat can be satisfied only through a political revolution that replaces To the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (state, government, parties, press, etc. - editor's note) the dictatorship of the proletariat (state, government, press party, etc. of the proletariat - ed) ".

 Massively, for another week, the Educational rally in downtown Athens was held with the participation of student associations, teachers and students.
 <br>
<br>
 The racing moves have participated in the demonstration with the banner of racing moves, teacher movements and student resistance. With our slogans we highlighted the opposition to the Pierrakakis bill and the need to unite the struggling students, students, teachers with farmers and workers, since we all fight against the system that is destroyed. We intervened during the demonstration in the concentrated crowd with the four -page racing moves for Article 16, Tricks, Stickers and Notices.
 <br>
<br>
 The march started from the Propylaea and was massed during it, while in the Constitution it was united with the beekeepers demonstrating against the EU anti -groomed policy. The body of the demonstration shouted massively "students, farmers a voice and a fist".
 <br/>
<br/>
 Police throughout the march, and especially in the Constitution, had created a suffocating cluster around the body of protesters in order to terrorize the struggling people, who once again did not lean their head in front of state terrorism and continued to shout for his rights.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The mass was, of course, obviously diminished compared to previous demonstrations, which is largely attributed to the imposition of remotely on most universities in order to suppress the struggle. We continue to invite all students to be massively abstaining from the television, which is the only way to legitimize and mix its role in breaking the student movement and further massively the next demonstrations, escalating the struggle for the vote.

<a href="https://www.waz.de/staedte/essen/article241730818/Verdacht-auf-Sozialbetrug-Stadt-Essen-ueberprueft-Haeuser.html">
   In Essen in North Rhine-Westphalia there was once again a raid. This is not unusual in itself, only that this time it was not a raid in the vicinity of so -called "Arab clans", but an operation against "social service recipients".
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On Wednesday morning, the regulatory office, together with employees of the housing supervision, the residents' registration office, the immigration office, financial accounting and the job center, checked a total of six properties in Elisenstrasse in Essen's Ostviertel. The bulls performed “administrative assistance” with an entire hundred.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Essen Eastern district and Elisenstrasse have to be said that it is one of the poorest, most neglected and precarious streets of Essen. The blocks around Elisenstrasse are characterized by migrant workers from Southeast Europe, which are often forced to pursue all kinds of day -long work and undeclared work by the chauvinist legislation of the German state. The park opposite Elisenstraße is a meeting point for alcohol and drug addicts and right next to it is a so-called "sister mission" of the Catholic Church, which regularly organizes food expenses that lead to long snakes around the street.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, the Funke Medien Group, the regional edition of the most standard, the city speaks of success before an evaluation of the raid. The reason for this is that 52 people allegedly could not be found in their apartments in this operation and that they are deregistered with immediate effect from government transfer services. In plain language, this means that the city of Essen people only relate to social assistance due to the fact that they were not there at the time of the raid. This is an attack on the fundamental rights of these people in several respect. First of all, every person has the right to freedom of movement and a raid with a hundred of the police is not an appointment for the agency to appear. You are - regardless of whether with a German passport or not - you are not forced to stay in your apartment, because the bureaucrats and civil servants of the bourgeois state could occur with the doors. To conclude from the absence of people in their apartments that they have no longer increased this scandal.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As with similar operations in Duisburg and other retirement cities, it is an attempt to pass on the loads and costs of the crises to the deepest and broadest parts of the working class with very administrative means. Especially against migrants and increasingly against people from Romania and Bulgaria. This is the policy of the Federal Government and in particular a Christian Lindner who is concrete implemented here when attempts are made to save in the poorest parts of our class and brutally with racist and chauvinistic means.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The residents of the controlled buildings meanwhile live in sometimes inhumane conditions: poor general condition of the houses, broken doors and tinkered power supply, mold, moist walls and blankets. Meanwhile, the city is not so administrative against the owners and at least profiteers and co -causers of these conditions. There is a warning and an appointment for rectification.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It turns out that the entire instruments of the police state and militarization, which have been built over the years and were legitimized racistically, are increasingly being used to be opened against other parts of the working class bit by bit.

   On Wednesday, February 21, we said goodbye to Jorge Risi, Roque as we knew him, in the cemetery of La Chacarita. With the presence of his son Andrés, family, friends and comrades we give him a fair and deserved tribute to a revolutionary communist with a long trajectory of militancy and construction of our party since its foundation.
  </p>
<p>
   To remember his friend and comrade Sebastián Ramírez, who with his words referred to passages from Roque's life, to his firm conviction of revolutionary communist.
  </p>
<p>
   “Although we cannot deny the sadness of the loss of a friend who came to say goodbye, Jorge Risi, Roque, we are awakened by a smile remembering some aspect or anecdote of the relationship with him.
  </p>
<p>
   “Bonaerense from Pehuajó, he met an old field doctor, Dr. Rocha, and was a friend of his son Jorge.
  </p>
<p>
   “Let's imagine Roque playing basketball, in the land of giants he will have crazy to more than one with his activity, his push and his pick and roll. Roque was devilish, played not only basketball, but also football. The sport was part of his life, and in football he became a reserve of Lanús, of students.
  </p>
<p>
   “It generated countless friends, despite a turbulent, devilish character. The man was difficult. Friend of Otto Vargas, friend of the Clan Stivel. Things that perhaps at the time we would not have told, so many years spent that we can bleach some of their relationships and some of his tasks such as the link with personalities such as Federico Luppi, Carlos Carella, Marilina Ross. Their poachers in the middle of lead in the cars in motion while exchanging their "figurines" and arguing politics being that they were their friends. Friend of David Viñas.
  </p>
<p>
   “With Roque I shared two or three moments. A moment, in an avatar of life we end up sharing a department along with the homeowner; Garanto that we went crazy with donors who never ended, and the poor guy had to go early in the morning to work. This was the relationship with Roque.
  </p>
<p>
   “The other issue is that being how it was a precarre founding member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, with him and with César Gody Alvarez we formed a group whose task was the incorporation of hundreds of scattered companions who chose the path of their incorporation into the PCR.
  </p>
<p>
   “Roque lived with absolute fidelity to his ideas, leaves a million friends and a toothbrush. A frugal, austere man. This was fellow Roque. He occupied dozens of tasks, in all of them he responded.
