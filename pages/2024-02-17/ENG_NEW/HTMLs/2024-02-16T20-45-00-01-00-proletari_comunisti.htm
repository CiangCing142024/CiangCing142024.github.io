  The last recent feminicides are precisely of the last few days.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  February 14th 
 There was the one in Cisterna di Latina, in which the 
 Mother and sister of an ex -girlfriend of the murderer. And the day before yesterday is 
 It was the killing of a 61 -year -old woman in Bolzano.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  From the beginning of 
 This year there are already 8 feminicides, sometimes, as has happened to 
 Cisterna di Latina these are double femicide.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we want us 
 focus a moment on this of Cisterna di Latina because there is a 
 aspect that have highlighted few newspapers, but it is 
 significant.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The latter 
 femicide was committed by a financier but is not the only one 
 committed by the police, of those who have the easy gun, why 
 always in this country - which is not a great country, yes 
 it is a reality of less than 40,000 inhabitants - in previous years, coincidentally, there have been 2 more 
 Feminicides: one in 2018 at the hands of an appointed carabinieri 
 who, not only did he shoot his wife, but also killed his two daughters, 
 Then he committed suicide. In 2014 another: in this case an agent of 
 Penitentiary police killed his partner.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Why in the 
 same country - not great - these feminicides occurred for 
 hand of the police or in any case committed by those who have the 
 Possibility to have weapons?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We immediately link this femicide to the decree that the Meloni government is preparing. 
 It is said that the men of the police can keep with them 
 always the gun, that is, in fact these men also at home, too 
 in private situations, they will always have to have the 
 pistol. And clearly this will only feed the killings, 
 The feminicides, by this type of men who consider 
 evidently as "normal" to respond to situations of different choices 
 by women, other than their will, and react by shooting, 
 react by killing.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How do we have 
 written other times, it is a war, a low war 
 intensity against women, with feminicides that are increasing, 
 who are becoming almost daily, at least of those who do 
 They know, who arrive in the press, arrive on television.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These 
 feminicides are made by new men, with certain conceptions 
 patriarcalists, but above all with fascist conceptions, it is 
 modern fascists because they are moved by hatred against women who do not 
 they accept to be subordinate, who want to decide their own 
 life, which want to break bonds that become oppressive chains and 
 violent in some cases, who do not agree to be them to “have 
 have a head on the shoulders ”, as Meloni says, and who must 
 Being good women who mainly think about the family.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And the fascism of 
 which we now have an institutional expression in the government and in 
 representatives of this state, of these institutions, in ministers 
 which are part of this government produces a sort of modern 
 patriarchism that is not old patriarchism, but it is a new one, 
 In a sense more social, more political, more ideological, more 
 terrible, institutional, which therefore cannot be fought 
 only with culture, with education, etc., but must be 
 fought with the struggle to overthrow this modern system 
 fascist.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This because, 
 As a writer said, it is not these "ancient men", 
 they are very modern ancient men, frustrated by the freedom that the 
 women rightly want, who feel like the theft of theirs 
 freedom, of their property on women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today this 
 war against women goes to intensify because the modern 
 Fascism is the construction, normal, of all that everything that 
 it is reactionary, male chauvinist, rotten and towards this the little ones, 
 ineffective, measures that the Meloni government boasts are 
 truly of absolute hypocrisy, because, at the same time, 
 precisely the ministers, exponents of brothers of Italy, the party al 
 government, issue statements and make real campaigns, 
 ideological and political for which the centrality of the role of women 
 it must be at home, it must be in taking care of the children and that 
 So everything that goes against this becomes provocation, 
 Become that you have fault if then, in the face of these life choices 
 Different, your husband, your ex, kills you.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The fascist humus 
 It makes normal and justified to react to women. How normal it is 
 in the US, but not only in the United States, that men, boys, 
 Frustrated harness the weapons and kill at the mass level.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Therefore it must 
 be normal that the police, through a decree, 
 they can always have the weapon with them. Fascism brings one 
 "Normality" of reaction: it seems almost obvious that the reaction must be violent, a reaction that then leads to this daily massacre 
 of women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the face of 
 However, this rises a response from women, a response of struggle.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  November 25th 
 It was not obvious that there was that participation of half a million 
 of women and also of men, but above all in the vast 
 majority of women, at the Rome event. It was a 
 imposing event, it was also a demonstration 
 different from the others of the previous years, because it was full 
 of anger, of determination. There were the signs that said “We are 
 Furious "," The witches are back ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today it is, 
 also looking at next March 8, to raise, extend in each 
 place, in every city, in every workplace - where among other things 
 There are also a whole other series of economic violence, of 
 conditions of life, discrimination, harassment towards women, 
 The workers - that this enormous tide of women extends.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is about giving 
 continuity, to give strength, but above all we think it is 
 it is necessary more and more to direct the struggle of women towards one 
 Revolution that is cleaning the clean men who hate the 
 women, governments, states that hate women.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Say enough to 
 femicide means more struggle, and mass struggle than women in 
 every place, more dangerous struggle
 </p>
