  The revolutionary has boycotted presidential elections as usual and in new forms. The boycott of the boycott has been distributed by posters and leaflets in addition to the demonstration on January 27, and we have received a documentation of sabotage at least in the second round. More in this article on Thursday, February 8, of the anti -light panel in Tampere, attended by representatives of the political trends that were in the fighting presidential election.

  All in all, there were about twenty participants, and two hours were not enough for the lively panel discussion and the equally plentiful audience speeches each minute. The panelists answered the questions, explaining from their own perspectives, for example. What a single-inch Yankee orientation (NATO) of candidates (NATO) and a slightly more positive position on the so-called self-defense rights of self-defense with a slightly more difference is about the political situation. The answers could be interpreted by differences in the perception of the imperialist world system. Russia and Finland, but everyone saw a nominee even reflecting the recession of the old power.

  The panelists agreed that in the 2024 presidential election, it was not worth voting in either round, but there was a variation in the explanatory memorandum (cf.
  <a href="https://punalippu.noblogs.org/post/2024/01/06/vaalit-ei-vallankumous-kylla-2/">
   The Maoist's boycott line to the election of the bourgeois dictatorship, regardless of candidate layouts
  </a>
  ). When discussing the reasons for the relatively high voting activity of the presidential elections, it was appropriate to emphasize that the presidential elections are really important elections, and that, for example, in the municipal elections, the contrast between the democratic and everyday life and the lack of actual power to be made, for example, is more tired for the people. The panelists had different criticisms of the presidential institution, as well as visions of performing the tasks now part of the president in the society and in the world, but at this point, the Maoinen focused specifically on the criticism of the Finnish Republic, in general or as such. Instead of voting in the ongoing presidential election, the panelists urged other activities, each with their own emphasis, for example. From professional organization to study activities, everyone expressed their support for the Socialist Revolution, the rise of the barricades, as the Maoist progressed to the basics of the armed revolution to crush the bourgeois state machinery and, in particular, the armed forces from all the socialism they need.

  In the midst of the questions, the panelists had been able to comment on each other's answers, which happened in a good spirit, highlighting relative similarities and also deep line differences. The audience issues did not become less, and the question of the question was the audience only became more enthusiastic and more and more encouraged to take the speech until the time limit came. The last issue of the audience was the mind -waking up, "What gives you hope?" The panelists were largely responsible for the fighting of the troops, some emphasized the horror of the alternative to socialism (= barbaria), one as the vision of the development of the folk wars and the development of the international communist movement.

  It is noteworthy that at least Tampere did not have any non-Marxist political trend against the presidential election. "Without a revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement," as Lenin said, and being a revolutionary, let alone Marxist (acting), is not a sheer announcement. Thus, it is natural that revolutionary troops are increasingly interested in finding out what are really alternatives.
