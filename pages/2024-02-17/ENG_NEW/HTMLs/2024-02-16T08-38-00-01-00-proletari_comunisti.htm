   Farmers have started their "Delhi Chalo" march 
 (Come to Delhi) Tuesday morning, aboard trucks and loaded trolleys 
 food, bedding and other supplies, after the 
 negotiations with the government have not resulted in a commitment on 
  Minimum prices for a whole series of cultures. The authorities have 
 taken strict safety measures in the neighboring areas of New 
 Delhi. Hundreds of police officers were deployed 
  In the middle of cement blocks surmounted by barbed wire and 
 containers intended to block the road to convoy. Security forces 
 arrested farmers on the border of Shambhu, who separates the 
 Pendjab and Haryana - the northern states to which the 
 Most farmers - almost 200 km from their destination.

  <p>
   The demonstrators threw stones and tried to break the 
 barricades, police and paramilitary forces have used 
 tear gas and water cannons. Security forces have 
 also used drones to drop tear gas grenades on 
 farmers who, in response, have launched kite in the 
 Heaven in the hope of tangling the machines. Several unions 
 of farmers said they would protest against the action of the 
 Police by blocking rail traffic in several places in Pendjab 
  For four hours Thursday.
