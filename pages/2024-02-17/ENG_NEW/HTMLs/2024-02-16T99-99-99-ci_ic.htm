President Mao, head of the CCP, was the direct responsible and <br> personally by the direction of two grand events in the twentieth century: the great Chinese revolution <br> (1949) and the great proletarian cultural revolution (1966-1976). In the course of these processes, established and <br> Developed Maoism: New, Third and Higher Stage of Marxism. Boosted the ideology of <br> international proletariat at its highest summit, continuing the labor of Marx, Engels, Lenin and <br> Stalin, resolving in a manner, decisive issues for the world proletarian revolution. The big <br> Chinese revolution represented the solution of the problem of how to make the proletarian revolution, uninterrupted to <br> Socialism, in semicolonial and semi -feudal countries. GRCP resolved the issue of continuing <br> Revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat towards the golden communism. From the theoretical point of view, the <br> Maoism is a qualitative leap in the three constitutive parts of Marxism as a whole. At <br> Marxist philosophy, President Mao makes a brilliant leap in establishing the law of contradiction as law <br> unique fundamental of the materialistic dialectic, in addition to completing the development of the Marxist theory of the <br> knowledge established by Lenin. In Marxist political economy, it advances in a crucial way in the <br> establishment of the economic laws of socialist construction, how the contradiction between proletariat and <br> Bourgeoisie follows as the main contradiction in this stage of transition to communism. In addition, it establishes <br> theory of bureaucratic capitalism, type of capitalism engendered by imperialism in <br> colonies/semicolonies, resulting from the export of capital. In doing so, it develops the Leninist theory of the <br> imperialism, as it shows the indissoluble relationship between imperialism and landlords in these countries <br> oppressed. In scientific socialism, President Mao establishes the theory of the new revolution <br> Democracy, universal form of the proletarian revolution in the colonial/semicolonial countries and the passage <br> uninterrupted from it to socialism; and how to bring the class struggle in socialism in the conditions of the dictatorship of the <br> proletariat to develop the transition to communism and cast the danger of restoration, through <br> successive proletarian cultural revolutions. Moreover, it establishes the military theory of the proletariat in its form <br> most developed: the prolonged popular war. Today, more than ever, to be a communist is to be Marxist- <br> Leninist-Maoist. Therefore, it is of great importance the call of the International Communist League (LCI) <br> For the celebration throughout the Globe of the 130th anniversary of President Mao Tsetung's Christmas. <br> In this same December 26, a year of the public announcement of the foundation of LCI, Nova, will be completed <br> international organization of the proletariat created by the successful unified Maoist International Conference<br>(CIMU). CIMU was the result of more than ten years of concentrated work, meetings, conferences <br> Regional and international action campaigns. After this resolute and high fight, 15 parties and organizations <br> Marxist-Leninist-Maoists from 14 countries gave birth to LCI and thus communicated their decision to the proletariat <br> International: <br> “Marxist-Leninist-Mauo-Mainist parties and organizations participating in the International Conference <br> Unified Maoist (CIMU), following the path of the Third International, founded by the great <br> Lenin, and the best traditions of the International Communist Movement (MCI), solemnly declare <br> to the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world who made the historical decision and <br> transcendental to bring to life the new Maoist International Organization, founded under three large and <br> Glorious Red Flags: Maoism, the fight against revisionism and the proletarian revolution <br> worldwide. <br> With deep communist conviction, the parties and communist organizations gathered here in the <br> We reaffirm, once again and with solemn commitment, to fulfill the conference agreements <br> Unified Maoist International unfurling, defending and applying the Almighty Ideology of the <br> International proletariat, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. <br><br><br> With a firm commitment to the arduous and tireless struggle to impose Maoism as the only command and guide <br> of the World Revolution, the only red and iberousable flag that is a guarantee of the triumph for the <br> proletariat, for the oppressed nations and the people of the world in their inexorable march to <br> gold and forever resplendent communism. ” <br> <br> (Political Declaration and Principles of the International Communist League) 1 <br> The realization of CIMU culminated in a phase characterized by dispersion and attempts to regroup <br> forces and, at the same time, opened a new phase of an intense two -line struggle, which traveled all over the year <br> 2022, after the publication of the discussion bases by the Coordinating Committee for a Conference <br> Unified Maoist International. The communist international journal published all positions <br> critics and supporters of the discussion bases, promoting a two -line struggle that has not been seen <br> In the International Communist Movement. CIMU was the culmination of a step for organizations <br> Gifts and for the supporters who could not get to the big event. The brilliant political statement and <br> Principles, published on December 26, was his highest ideological result. The actions of <br> lining in its celebration, which traveled dozens of countries, in January 2023, were the <br> first practical results of the Foundation of the International Communist League, followed by the massive <br> May 1st celebrations, by the international campaign against the construction of the interoceanic corridor of the <br> Tehuantepec (Mexico) isthmus, from the powerful tribute to the 50th anniversary of the ibrahim fighter <br> Kaypakkaya (TKP/ML), from the campaign in honor and glory to the memory of the comrades Philippines Benito and Wilma <br> (PCF), of internationalist actions for the release of political prisoners in the demonstrations in France and the <br> called to the democratic, anti-imperialist and revolutionary forces there is a forceful <br> support to the Heroic National Resistance Palestinian and condemnation and rejection of the Zionist state of Israel and <br> his criminal actions over the 76 years of Palestinian people's genocide. <br> Exactly 40 years ago, President Gonzalo and the PCP launched the challenging campaign for Maoism. A <br> CIMU and the founding of the LCI, they have achieved an important stage of this task that represents <br> a decisive step in the worldwide reunification of communists, overcoming dispersion, in the fight against <br> revisionism and towards the future reconstitution of the glorious communist international. Therefore represents, <br> a hard blow to imperialism, revisionism and world reaction, which will be, sooner than late, <br> swept from the face of the earth by the world proletarian revolution! World revolution is composed of two <br> large currents: the international proletarian revolutionary movement (present in all countries) and the <br> National Liberation Movement (present in the colonial and semicolonial countries). The first current is the <br> Existing communist parties or to be constituted and reconstituted in all countries on the planet and the <br> MCI; the second stream represents the democratic-revolutionary struggle present in all colonial countries <br> and semicolonials that must be directed by their respective communist parties. The foundation of LCI is <br> An important role in the revolutionary fusion of these two major RPM currents. <br> The brilliant revolutionary countereofensive of the Heroic National Resistance Palestine struck in a <br> True the genocidal Zionist state of Israel. The bold attack driven by the Palestinian guerrillas, <br> under the direction of the Palestinian National Resistance (Hamas, Jihad Islamic, Popular Liberation Front of<br>Palestine and Democratic Front of Liberation of Palestine), against the territory occupied by Israel <br> A great victory of the world proletarian revolution. After all, it represented a forceful blow against the <br> occupation and expansionism of the Israeli Zionist state and its master, the Yankee imperialism, the greatest enemy <br> of the peoples of the world. The masses from around the world celebrated this great victory of the National Resistance <br> Palestine, which puts even more bluntly at the center of the world debate, than the peoples and nations <br> oppressed from around the world are alive, burning of hope in a decided and cross fight against the <br> Imperialist domination. These masses cry out for an ideological, political and military direction consequent and, <br> Therefore, it is the duty of the international communist movement to accelerate the step of its combat to achieve <br> The superior form of the revolutionary class struggle which is the popular war. <br> Heroic Palestinian National Resistance, the great victory of the Taliban in the expulsion of the Yankee troops <br> territory and the persistent resistance of the Ukrainian people who fight, at the same time, against the occupation <br> Russian imperialist and against the direction of Zelenski, Lacaio of Yankee and European Union, <br> represent the current confirmation that in imperialism the main contradiction of this stage of capitalism is <br> which opposes people and nations oppressed to imperialist domain. This powerful flag, unfurled by the <br> President Mao in the 1960s, was again raised by LCI, precisely and bluntly, in <br> your political and principles declaration: <br><br><br> “The process of capitalist society as a whole has as its fundamental contradiction to <br> contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, but when it goes from non -monopolistic capitalism to <br> monopolistic capitalism, or imperialism, develop in the world three contradictions <br> Fundamental: <br> First contradiction: between oppressed nations, on the one hand, and superpowers and imperialist powers, <br> for another. This is the main contradiction at the present time and, at the same time, the contradiction <br> main of the time of imperialism. <br> Second contradiction: between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. <br> Third contradiction: interimperialist. ” (CPCH) 2 <br> The restlessness of the tireless struggle of national liberation in the 21st century, expressed <br> condensed way in the heroic struggle of the Palestinian masses, is a patent manifestation that the revolution <br> World proletarian urgently calls for the Maoist direction. Because only maoism can direct this <br> Fight and lead it to victory against imperialism; This is because it was Maoism that in establishing the law of <br> contradiction as a unique fundamental law of materialistic dialectic, it was able to demonstrate that imperialism <br> supports national oppression in the reproduction of semi -feudality in the colonial and semicolonial countries and forged <br> thus the revolution of new democracy as a universal form of the proletarian revolution in the oppressed countries <br> by imperialism. Maoism will be assumed by these masses insofar as the communists support, <br> Participate directly and direct these struggles. In this sense the popular wars ongoing, in Peru, Türkiye, <br> India and Philippines, and those who are beginning, constitute great baluvers for the impulse and correct direction <br> For these struggles. <br> Palestinian, Afghan and Ukrainian resistances, despite their national management and national-bourgeois, <br> spontaneously approaches the postulates of Maoism through the theory of prolonged popular war, <br> Applying it in your own way, as only then can you give blunt blows to imperialism. At the <br> However, this is not sufficient, it is necessary that these processes assume Maoism as line and direction <br> ideological-political, because only in this way will they increase their anti-imperialist resistance to a war <br> national revolutionary-democratic revolutionary uninterrupted to socialism, the only possible way to defeat and sweep <br> imperialism of the face of the earth. However, this feat will only be held with the strengthening of MCI, with the <br> constitution and reconstitution of communist parties in each country due to start and develop the <br> Popular War. In relation to national resistance, it is urgent that the communists support them, participate <br> directly from these and thus fight for them proletarian direction. <br> The founding of LCI is an important step in this regard, as it has advanced largely against the danger of <br> dispersion, unifying in the same international organization 15 parties and Marxist-Leninist organizations <br> Maoists from 14 countries. Among which communist party of Peru-PCP and Communist Party of the <br> Turkey/Marxist-Leninist-TKP/ML, which direct two very important popular wars in the world. To the <br> At the same time, the foundation of LCI opens a new stage in the fight of two lines in MCI. On the one hand, <br> important parties such as the Communist Party of the Filipinas-PCF and Communist Party of India (Maoist)-<br>PCI (m), who drive very important popular wars, but could not participate in CIMU and <br> their preparatory debates, positioned themselves this year, differently about the founding of LCI and <br> their political and principles declaration. On the other hand, organizations that were invited to the <br> Conference, participated in the fight of two public lines last year and deliberately decided not to <br> Participate in CIMU and defend your positions there. In this last group we highlight two organizations that in the <br> recent past were very close to Avakianism and Prachandism, respectively UOC (MLM) <br> Colombia and PCM (Italy), who continued to manifest the same critical positions to CIMU and then <br> Founded LCI. <br> The struggle of two lines around the political statement and principles of LCI, which has traveled the year of <br> 2023, is the continuity, in a new level, of the struggle of two lines around the bases of discussion that <br> they called CIMU. There are several differences and shades in these positions, however between <br> they there are important differences that outline a demarcation line: those who defend the <br> of the Revolution of New Democracy and the principle of contradiction between nations and oppressed peoples versus <br><br><br> imperialism; and those who deny the crucial importance of the new democracy revolution and relegate <br> main contradiction to a secondary condition. <br> On the one hand, the parties and organizations participating in LCI, plus PCF and PCI (m) position themselves <br> openly by the proletarian, red line, which fully corresponds to the imperialist stage and the time <br> gift. On the other hand, UOC (MLM) and PCM (Italy) that argue that imperialism has swept relations <br> Semi -feudal of semicolonial countries increasingly becoming the revolution of new democracy. You <br> first represent the defense of Maoism, the universality of the revolution of new democracy for <br> semicolonial countries. The seconds follow as advocates of the 21st century revisionist modalities, <br> Notably Avakianism and Prachandism. UOC (MLM) more explicitly, the PCM (Italy) of <br> more cunning and covered way. <br> One day after the historical announcement of the founding of the LCI, the Communist Workers Union (MLM), from Colombia, <br> issued a statement in which he justified to his foundations not to participate in CIMU. Shortly thereafter, <br> published a long document, in which it criticizes the 15 organizations and founding parties of LCI, and <br> particularly our party, the Communist Party of Brazil (P.C.B.), for an alleged “sectarianism and <br> leftism". In this document UOC (MLM) attacks us specifically because they were supposed to have been <br> treated “grotesque and humiliating” in a visit they made to Brazil in 2016. We will refute, <br> end, this tail and vile lie, because we consider it more important for MCI to enter the content <br> ideological, philosophical, political and economic of UOC criticisms (MLM) to CIMU and parties and <br> Founding organizations of LCI. As President Gonzalo teaches us we must elevate the ideological struggle <br> at the level of the fight of two lines to eliminate the opportunistic positions of the right and “left” and the <br> dogmatism, applating revisionism. The UOC (MLM) document of attack on LCI and P.C.B. in <br> particular, as it defends in detail its position in such a way to understand its <br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, which allows us to see its convergence with revisionism and consequent <br> denial of Maoism. Because, although, it defines itself as a “Marxist-Leninist-Maoist” openly denies the law of <br> contradiction as the only fundamental law of dialectic, denies the validity of the revolution of new democracy <br> for colonial/semicolonial countries, affirming the existence of a supposed progressive tendency in the <br> imperialism, denies the decisive importance of the peasant struggle for the revolution in the countries oppressed by the <br> imperialism. Colombia is the country with the highest land concentration in the world, with one of the largest <br> traditions of peasant armed struggle in Latin America, and the direction of UOC (MLM) states that in its country <br> There are virtually no more peasants and the Colombian revolution would be immediately socialist. <br> After a century of its founding, very tough experiences in the struggle to establish itself as <br> authentic revolutionary party of the proletariat and especially in the last almost three decades of struggle for <br> their reconstitution as a militarized communist party, Marxist-leninist-Maoist, mainly <br> Maoist, President Gonzalo Universal Validity contributions, P.C.B. in the wide learning process of <br> their own history and international experience, rectifying errors, but always relying on the aspects <br> positives of all international experience, considers that it is necessary and unavoidable to treat more <br> complete and strict deviations and tenders on the fundamental issues of Marxism and so crucial<br>balance of the historical experience of the proletarian revolution and the International Communist Movement-MCI, <br> particularly of these deviations and their tergiversals in the present time. In this document, in the purpose of <br> contribute to the struggle of two lines on such issues, we do so in the form of controversy, as <br> criticism and attacks of the direction of UOC (MLM) to LCI and P.C.B., positions, which we characterize as <br> Avakianism and trotskism, they present themselves more concentrated and more explicitly. Throughout the text, in <br> Our analyzes and arguments, we use numerous and long quotes from the classics of Marxism, <br> many of them already well known by many, however we resort to them repeatedly <br> We consider extremely important in the present fight of two lines ongoing in MCI, plant with all <br> scientific rigor its conceptual basis and, at the same time, also pay attention to all possible readers and <br> interested in this struggle, concerned with attracting to her the growing revolutionary activism of the new <br> generations, among which many certainly still lack greater mastery of revolutionary theory. <br> II- The Law of Contradiction: Single Fundamental Law of Materialist Dialectic <br><br><br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is the scientific ideology of the proletariat, it is the doctrine “Almighty because <br> Exact ”3, according to Lenin's definition. It is ideology because it is the thought of a certain class <br> social, it is scientific because it supports and seeks the truth as a weapon to transform the world: <br> “In a nutshell, all ideology is historically conditional, but all scientific ideology <br> (differently, for example, of religious ideology) corresponds unconditionally a <br> objective truth, an absolute nature. ” (Lenin) 4 <br> Marxist philosophy is dialectical materialism. The fundamental problem of philosophical materialism constitutes <br> The relationship between thought and being, in which being is the primacy. Engels establishes this issue in a way <br> crystal clear in his work Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of German classical philosophy, by defining that materialism <br> dialectical defends the primary character of being in relation to thought and that thought is capable of <br> Know, reflecting the objective laws of matter and transforming it. Dialectic deals with the general laws of the <br> movement, of the connection between processes, things and phenomena. The materialistic dialectic studies the general laws <br> of the movement of matter in its various manifestations: nature, society and thought. <br> The most general formulations of dialectical materialism were developing in the course of class struggle and <br> of the process of application of the ideology of the international proletariat, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, in <br> concrete revolutionary practice. Philosophy as an indispensable part of revolutionary theory was being <br> more accurately formulated with each step of the development of ideology. As product of this <br> process, in the third stage, the maoism, works the superior synthesis, the most advanced of the content <br> Revolutionary of Materialist Dialectic. In his works on practice, on contradiction (1937), on <br> The correct treatment of contradictions within the people (1957) and where does the right ideas come from? (1963), <br> as well as in the great philosophical controversy on the CCCH, which occurred between May 1964 and May 1965, around the <br> philosophical principle that everything in the universe is one that is divided into two, President Mao, amid the acute <br> Class struggle and two -line struggle, made a big leap in Marxist philosophy, both in its formulation <br> as in its application, as well as its ability to bring this revolutionary philosophy to the wide <br> pastas. <br> The jump in the materialistic dialectic given by Maoism can be summed up: all the processes of matter, <br> that is, in the universe (nature, society and thought), they occur as the development of a unity <br> Between two contradictory aspects, the struggle between the opposites runs through all the processes from beginning to end, or <br> resolution of them. The opposite aspects are interdependent and opposite, at the same time, in the process <br> development of something or phenomenon, interdependence, or unity between the opposites is <br> relative and the struggle is absolute. In the development of contradiction, it is advanced from a stage of change <br> Quantitative for a qualitative stage of change, in which the transformation is apparent and manifest. A <br> qualitative change corresponds to the quality leap in the phenomenon, when the interdependence between the <br> contrary aspects break and finally the opposites become their opposite <br> new unity of opposites and thus develops infinitely. The affirmation of the old unit of <br> contrary is advanced to the negation of this unit, the transformation of the quality of the phenomenon or to the <br> emergence of a new process. <br> As we will see more in detail, this is the highest formulation of the established Marxist philosophy<br>by Maoism on the eve of the triggering of GRCP. Represents both a leap in the philosophical formulation of the <br> Marxism as a continuity of it. Because, although, Marx and Lenin had no occasion or <br> time to establish the law of contradiction as a unique fundamental law of dialectic <br> Materialist, they applied this same content to their theoretical and practical work. Taking capital, work <br> Marx Magna, we will find this same fundamental law applied, whose most accurate formulation and <br> Popular has achieved superior development with Maoism. Likewise, we will find throughout the <br> Arsenal Leninist numerous examples of the precise application of the unique fundamental law of materialistic dialectic. <br> Evident, that the establishment of the law of contradiction by President Mao is a leap, as it arms the <br> proletariat with a sharper and more accurate philosophy. However, philosophy is not a science above <br> sciences and their development is an inseparable part of the process of advancement of systematized knowledge of the <br> humanity. Likewise, that the advance of the different branches of science depends on the advance of philosophy, <br> The advance of this also depends on the advance of social and natural science; and all depend on the advancement of <br><br><br> social practice in its three fundamental types: the struggle for production, class struggle and experimentation <br> scientific. <br> Philosophy is an inseparable part of the theory, so that Marx could not truly establish <br> objective laws of the emergence, development, crisis and replacement of bourgeois society with communism <br> if they did not start from the most advanced philosophy, the most revolutionary world conception in human history <br> which is dialectical materialism. President Mao, therefore, formulates and applies the materialistic dialectic in his <br> superior form not in opposition to Marx and Lenin, but complying with theoretical tasks that could not be <br> previously resolved. The truth does not arise ready at once, there is no immediate knowledge in <br> No scientific branch and so is it in the scientific ideology of the proletariat. Lenin points out that: <br> “If Marx did not leave a 'logic' (with large lyrics), he left the logic of Capital, and that should <br> use deeply on this issue. In the capital is applied to a science the logic, dialectic and <br> The theory of knowledge (it is not necessary 3 words: it is one and the same thing) of materialism, which <br> He took everything valuable in Hegel and made this valuable advance. ” (Lenin) 5 <br> The leap given by President Mao in Marxist philosophy constitutes precisely the elaboration, formulation and <br> systematization of this “logic of capital”. By making it a jump plasma, as it sets the proletariat of the greatest <br> theoretical accuracy, key issue for solving new problems that arise in processes <br> particular revolutionaries and new situations that inevitably appear in the course of history. O <br> development of philosophy is particularly important for the direction of the struggle of two lines, because <br> as a conception of the world, mastering and staying firm in dialectical materialism is decisive to persist <br> In the proletarian revolutionary line, swimming against the current and the tide. President Mao's contributions to <br> Marxist philosophy handed her into the international proletariat in a deep, simple and combative way. This <br> Arms the class in a special way against revisionist deviations. Consistently incarnate the principles <br> Marxist revolutionary philosophical philosophicals are of great importance to successfully face the turmoil of <br> class struggle, from the process of revolution and counterrevolution in the world, develop the revolutionary struggle to <br> Higher high, persist in it until the complete victory of the world proletarian revolution. <br> In the fight against revisionism Marxist philosophy is of particular importance. Revisionism does not arise <br> of a philosophical “error” itself; Revisionism is an inevitable phenomenon in the class struggle of the proletariat <br> against bourgeoisie and appears in revolutionary organizations as an inevitable reflection of the class struggle in the <br> Vanguard consciousness. Revisionism increases its economic and social basis with the advent of <br> imperialism, and more <br> persist in Marxism or capitulate by reviewing their truths. The moments of greater intensification, on the eve of <br> decisive clashes or after important temporary defeats, they are reflected in the consciences of individuals <br> In two ways: overcoming the difficulties of the Claudicar in front of them. Claudication is the tendency to <br> revisionism, which initially appears in the form of conduct, after ideas, conceptions and then line <br> revisionist. <br> Revisionism, therefore, finds one of its first manifestations in the change of conception of <br> world, in the abandonment of the proletarian conception (dialectical materialist) and the assuming of others, be bourgeois<br>or breakfast. To structure a revisionist line, invariably, revisionism will have to <br> Falsify Marxist philosophy to create a “theoretical base” corresponding to its class betrayal. <br> After all, it is impossible to support an opportunistic right and “left” line relying on seriously <br> dialectical materialism. However, as the contingencies of political struggle often require important <br> tactical modifications, revisionism always seeks to sneak and hide behind what they call <br> “Particularities of the moment”. Thus, it is often easier to unmask a revisionist position in the <br> philosophical terrain than in the ground of politics. The importance of the theoretical struggle in the unmasking of <br> positions or revisionist lines is that it allows the proletarian line to maintain the initiative, anticipate and aplaste <br> the demonstrations, in their beginnings, of revisionist positions, through the struggle of two lines, preventing that <br> The revisionist line is structured in the party. <br> The most recent importance of the philosophical debate in the struggle of two lines in MCI against positions <br> Revisionists, it became evident in the course of MRI's historical experience. In 1980, PCR-UUSA and <br> The Chilean PCR called the autumn conference, whose most important result was to resume the fight <br> President Mao for overcoming the dispersion in MCI caused by the counterrevolutionary coup in China <br><br><br> (1976) and summon the 1984 Conference that gave rise to the MRI. Between 1980 and 1984, Bob Avakian and others <br> PCR-UUSA leaders published a series of philosophical articles and historical balance of the experience of <br> First wave of the world proletarian revolution. These documents constitute philosophical falsification <br> undertaken by Avakian in order to impose an opportunistic right -wing line on MCI. The fundamental of <br> Their positions is defeated at the 1984 Conference, whose result is the founding of MRI with a statement <br> Of fundamentally correct principles, although it contains important revisionist smuggling. As <br> entry into the PCP MRI and the two -line struggle taken by this sustained in the striking progress of <br> Popular War in Peru, the Avakianist revisionist positions went on to the defensive, waiting for the moment <br> Opposite to put your head out again. This opportunity occurs after the president's arrest <br> Gonzalo, in September 1992, and especially after the Patronha of the “Peace Letters”. Avakian, then, jumps to <br> Lecture by attacking, first in disguise and, therefore, openly the left positions in MRI. <br> The impact on MCI of the coup of the reaction on the PCP, as well as the recode that the popular war had entered, <br> negatively reverberated with the opportunistic line of Avakian, which raises the controversy of the need to <br> Whether or not to investigate whether or not President Gonzalo was the author of the rotten “peace letters”. This position, which <br> Truth took the patronas of the Peruvian reaction and Ianancal, in 1994, the demobilization of <br> International Campaign in Defense of the Life of President Gonzalo. With that Avakian intended to open <br> space to advance in MRI its capitulatory and liquidationist line, and soon, in 1998, with the absurd <br> Expulsion of MRI's TKP/ml, it works the predominance of its line in the Comri. <br> In the meantime, February 1996, the Glorious Popular War begins in Nepal, directed by the then PCN (M), <br> that at first takes a position against Avakianism, but soon converges with its position <br> capitulating against the general counterrevolutionary offensive that since the late 1980s and the beginning of <br> 1990, it champed the loose reins around the world, but concentrating its attack tells the popular war in <br> Peru. After five years of significant progress of the Popular War, Prachanda at the II National Conference <br> of PCN (M), in 2001, launches the document Grande Salto ahead where the first counterfeits appear <br> Philosophical of dialectical materialism with its rotten “theory of fusion”, in a re -presentation of the old theory <br> of the “reconciliation of contradictions”, or the revisionist conception of “two conform one”. In November <br> of 2006, when the Prachandist revisionist direction capitulates the popular war and signs the “Global Agreement of <br> peace ”, only the process of cabal ideological-political and military capitulation, whose <br> Philosophical falsifications of 2001 already foreshadowed. <br> The examples of Avakian and Pachanda illustrate the old and rotten revisionist path: capitulation - <br> Revisionism - Philosophical falsification to theoretically support line change. Bernstein sought <br> substantiate your revisionism using neo-kantist philosophy, advocating that there is no essential difference <br> Between materialism and idealism, between metaphysics and dialectic. Bukharin and Trotsky sought in falsifications <br> Philosophical of Deerin, who advocated that contradiction only emerged at a certain moment of the process, this<br>It is, the conciliation of the opposite aspects, the theoretical foundation of its revisionist position that sought <br> prevent the process of collectivization in agriculture. Kruschov, in turn, has philosophically based his <br> revisionist position with the “theory of productive forces” in the rehabilitation of the Deberin School in the USSR, <br> after capitalist restoration. Liu Shao-Chi, in turn, sought to theoretically substantiate his rotten line <br> of capitalist restoration in the philosophical falsification of Yang Sien-chos, theoretical revisionist, who argued that <br> The law of contradiction meant the fusion of the opposing aspects, their reconciliation, according to the principle <br> Revisionist that "two conform one," as opposed to the Maoist principle that "one is divided into two." <br> Revisionism always seeks to lead the philosophical debate to an academic terrain, where the controversy <br> appear as a quarrel around terminological or very abstract issues. Different currents <br> revisionists often opposes mutually around abstract philosophical terms, however, in <br> essence defend the same bourgeois or small bourgeois philosophical conception. The proletariat <br> revolutionary should clean the terrain of the philosophical debate of these academic quarrels to arrive <br> As objective as possible to the essence of the matter and thus reveal the content of the positions in dispute. <br> However, the importance of the philosophical struggle to the proper and correct development cannot be underestimated <br> the struggle of two lines, this is very clearly demarcated in the important document of the line of <br> left of President Mao, published by the CCCH, in 1971, three largest fights in the philosophical front in the <br> China, where it is stated that: <br><br><br> “The three important struggles in the philosophical front show that the confrontation between the two groups <br> opposites on this front has always been a reflection of the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, which <br> serves these struggles and that we should not consider the struggle in philosophy only ‘controversy <br> academic ’. Liu Shao-Chi, Yang Sien-chos and his similar to frantically attacked the <br> dialectical materialism and historical materialism, spread the reactionary idealism and metaphysics and <br> provoked a fight after another precisely with the vile eagerness to shake the philosophical base of the line <br> President Mao's proletarian revolutionary and create a 'theoretical base' for the revisionist line <br> counterrevolutionary that sought to restore capitalism. The three important fights on the front <br> philosophical teach us that the two -line struggle is, in the end, a struggle between the two <br> World conceptions, the proletarian and bourgeois. The conception of the world of a decide that line <br> defends and follows. ” (Copywriter Group for Revolutionary Mass Criticism of the Higher School of <br> Party, subordinate to the CC of the CCCH) .6 <br> In many terminological and conceptual aspects, the philosophical falsifications of Pachanda and Avakian <br> They seem to oppose. Avakian, formally, defends the Maoist principle that one is divided into two and criticizes the <br> Prachanda fusion theory as an expression of the revisionist conception of two conform one. <br> Prachanda is opposed to Avakian saying that MCI paid close attention to the principle that one is divided into <br> Two, but very little to the principle of unit unit-transformation. Avakian condemns the use by Marx <br> denial of denial in the capital as a “expression of almost religious determinism and <br> metaphysical ”present in the first stage of the ideology of the international proletariat. Prachanda in turn will <br> defend the denial of denial by stating that this law explains the development of the struggle of two <br> lines in the history of the Communist Party in Nepal. Avakian will say that the law of contradiction is the law <br> fundamental dialectic and that the denial of denial should be completely discarded. PRACHANDA <br> to this and states that it enriched the law of contradiction by adding to it the law of quantity and quality and the <br> Law of denial of denial. <br> Taking the terminology and manipulation of concepts, Prachanda and Avakian seem to be in positions <br> opposite. However, from a practical and ideological point of view, they essentially represent the same <br> revisionist modality in the 21st century. The proletarian philosophical criticism should clean this terrain of controversy <br> terminological to demonstrate the common bourgeois essence of these two positions and thus apply them <br> Kobicly as revisionist, capitulatory and traitors of the revolution. <br> UOC (MLM) in its attacks on LCI and P.C.B. It starts its philosophical argumentation by rehearsing an apparent <br> modification in its formulation of the law of contradiction. In his document from January 2023, he says that: <br> “We do not deny that the law of unity and struggle of contrary is the fundamental law of dialectical”, in addition <br> They claim to recognize the law “of denial of denial as one of the general laws of dialectic” and even that<br>This would only be “the third law of dialectic” 7. With this statement, UOC (MLM) appears agreement <br> with a basic principle of Maoism, namely, the condition of the law of the contradiction of a single fundamental law <br> of the materialistic dialectic. This would be the least to expect from a political force that claims Maoism, <br> but enough a look at this same UOC document (MLM) to realize the falseness of <br> your initial statement. Because, opposing the condition of contradiction as a fundamental law of dialectic, it states <br> That: “What is this 'role' that plays the denial of denial? Well, it is the general law that indicates the <br> direction of movement in various areas of social and natural life ”8. So it is not a falsehood of your <br> initial statement? State that the denial of denial is the law that indicates the direction of the movement is not in <br> divergence with the statement that the “law of unity and struggle of the opposites is the fundamental law of <br> dialectic"? <br> It is not, however, a conceptual or argumentative incongruity by UOC (MLM). Enough <br> know a little of its history to know the weight they give to the denial of denial as the most law <br> important dialectic. An illustrative example, in the 1990s, its theoretical organ was called <br> Contradiction, from the 2000s onwards, is called denial of denial. Already at that time formulates that: <br> “It is precisely the general law of dialectic that we call denial of denial to which the meaning, the <br> direction, of the movement: the rise, the progress, advance and replacement of the old with the new ”9. And the <br> importance that give to this issue, is not restricted to a theoretical or philosophical problem, consider the <br> management of the denial of denial as a decisive factor in the course of MCI during the experiences of <br> dictatorship of the proletariat in the twentieth century: <br><br><br> “Everyone knows how Stalin, in his work on dialectical materialism, which appears in history <br> of the PCU (B), cut out of dialectic the Law of Denial of Denial. And this was not "unpunished". The revolution <br> proletarian, which can no longer move by dialectical beds, tends to deny the state, to extinguish it <br> and can no longer deny the denied, affirming the kingdom of freedom, in an apparent return to <br> society without a state of the primitive community, but on the basis of all development <br> economic, cultural and political (of democracy), for many centuries of class societies. <br> Denial of denial! Not accept and take advantage of this trend, this objective social law, as <br> programmatic postulate and political objective of the working class, led us to two great <br> Defeats: Russia in 1956 and China in 1976. ” [UOC (MLM)] 10 <br> That is, it states that the fact that Stalin and President Mao did not assume the law of denial of denial resulted <br> in capitalist restoration in Russia and China. Evident, which contest the importance of the law of contradiction <br> and the leap represented by Maoism in Marxist philosophy. Conceiving that the denial of denial is the law that <br> Indicates the direction of movement is a serious error of understanding Marxist dialectic. Say, however, that <br> only the denial of denial would completely explain the replacement of the old by the new, because “the <br> movement is not linearly except as apparent cycles, in which each advance is for its <br> instead a setback, but definitely a ascension ”UOC (mlm) 11, constitutes a forgery <br> Philosophical of Marxism. <br> This position reaffirmed by the direction of UOC (MLM) is erroneous for three reasons: 1st) The law of contradiction is the <br> that governs the process of overcoming the old by the new, and therefore indicates the direction of movement and <br> transformation of matter; 2) state that the movement in ascending spiral, resulting from the denial of the <br> denial would correspond to an advance that is at the same time a setback is to apply the revisionist theory of <br> Conciliation of contradictions, of integrating two into one, is to oppose the Marxist dialectic. And, 3) because the law of <br> Contradiction is the unique fundamental law of dialectic, which we will underlie below. <br> President Mao in Contradiction, says that: <br> “We often talk about the 'replacement of the old with the new'. Such is the general and imprescriptible law of the <br> Universe. The transformation of one phenomenon into another, by jumps whose forms vary according to the <br> character of the phenomenon itself and according to the conditions under which it is, this is the process of <br> Substitution of the old man with the new. Whatever phenomenon is, there is always a contradiction between the old <br> And the new, which determines a series of winding course struggles. Of these struggles it results that the new grows <br> And it rises to the dominant position, while the old man, on the contrary, decreases and ends up dying. <br> As soon as the new gains a dominant position on the old, the old phenomenon becomes <br> qualitatively in a new phenomenon. ” (President Mao) 12 <br> This is the most objective and developed philosophical formulation about the replacement of the old man, about<br>from the direction of the movement. It must be seen that this formulation of President Mao corresponds to a great <br> development of Marxist dialectic. Because it is clarified, as never before, what the process of <br> Things and phenomena of the transformation of both aspects in their opposites. Every thing and every phenomenon is a <br> which is divided into two, there is a unit of opposites; in the conformation of this unit the aspect <br> New always arises fragile and weak, as a dominated aspect, therefore. The old man, initially, is the aspect <br> dominant and that determines the quality of said phenomenon, through the new struggle against the old man, of fragile <br> new becomes strong, of dominated aspect becomes dominant aspect and this change corresponds to a <br> change in the quality of the thing and the phenomenon, a new thing and a new phenomenon arises, but it follows <br> still the new struggle against the old man, now in new conditions, through this fight the new is still strengthened <br> more until the old look decreases and die. In this new thing and new phenomenon, as a new unit of <br> Contrary, the struggle between its two aspects never ceases. <br> In his argument in favor of denial of denial as the general law of dialectic that would best explain <br> Movement Directorate, UOC (MLM) contrasts Avakian's attacks on Marx and Engels <br> denial of denial in capital and anti-dühring. However, it assumes the same interpretation <br> Avakian counterfeit that for Marx and Engels the denial of denial would be an advance that is at the same <br> Time a setback. On the other hand, in its defense of denial of denial the direction of the UOC (mlm) mind <br> blatantly to its bases and the proletariat by presenting that Prachanda would oppose this principle <br> dialectical, in fact that was just the opposite. In a critique of the shameful capitulation <br> Prachandist states: <br><br><br> “We start with a small show on the ground of philosophy. The big leap ahead: an inevitable <br> historical need is a document presented by Prachanda and adopted by the II Conference <br> NATIONAL OF PCN (M) FEV/2001 (…). In the commitment to silence the qualitative jumps - the law of <br> revolutions - and in unaware of the denial of denial - the law of development, perspective, <br> of the future, socialism and communism - Prachanda argues that ‘Lenin raised the philosophy of <br> dialectical materialism to new heights. He widely explained that the principle of unity and struggle of <br> contrary is the only fundamental principle of dialectic '(…). ” [UOC (MLM)] 13 <br> Cite a document in which the Prachanda supposedly “would unknown the denial of denial”, and it is <br> precisely in this document, where the renegade, seeking to clarify the law of contradiction and the principle that a <br> It is divided into two, presents the history of the communist party of Nepal from the denial of denial: <br> “The full process of the Nepalese communist movement can also be seen as a denial of <br> denial. The party's initially correct policy was denied by revisionism and then the <br> revisionism through the correct revolutionary politics, and finally the great process of the popular war <br> emerged." (PRACHANDA) 14 <br> Once again it does not seem to be a trivial error of the UOC direction (MLM). It would not be a <br> Intentional forgery? After all it is repeated on other occasions, as in this passage where apparently <br> Off PRAY ALSO WITH AVAKIAN PRAY WITH PRACHANDA: <br> “It happens, therefore, that the founders of dialectical materialism, according to the 'new synthesis', were not, in the <br> finally, neither materialist nor dialectical, they had 'a somewhat narrow and linear vision', <br> took the concept of denial of the denial of Hegel's idealistic system, a horrible thing <br> manifests as 'the tendency for reductionism' and ‘can tend to inevitabilism and a <br> simplistic formula ’; no less or less like the grotesque refutation than the denial of denial <br> makes one of the followers of the 'Prachanda Way' at the Red Star, No. 21 (…). ” [UOC (MLM)] 15 <br> The article in question is not a refutation of such a dialectical law, on the contrary it is called denial of denial and <br> actually makes an open defense of the PCN revisionist positions (M) and, particularly, the rightist <br> Bhattarai. In this article is interpreted the denial of denial as a “advance that is at the same time a <br> setback ”and defends himself, to take both the Marxist classics and make a combination with their <br> revisionist opponents. <br> This UOC procedure (MLM) is the typical revisionist: a small textual fraud to “support” a <br> Great conceptual falsification. Textual fraud is the one that matters least, we will only use them to unmask them to <br> clean the terrain to wage the debate that really matters: the content of these falsifications <br> philosophical and their political and economic consequences. As seen: Avakian “defends” the law of contradiction <br> in opposition to the denial of denial and the principle that one is divided into two as opposed to the two<br>conform one. Prachanda defends the denial of denial, integrated into the law of contradiction, the theory of fusion and <br> the opposition of unit-unit-transformation to the principle that one is divided into two. UOC (MLM), for its <br> instead, he defends the denial of denial as the general law of dialectic in “opposition” to Avakian and hides from his <br> militancy that prachanda is an advocate of this same position. It is necessary to clean the “terminological” land of the <br> controversy, clarify the development of the unique fundamental law of dialectic, contradiction, in the course of <br> three stages of the ideology of the international proletariat, and to investigate the real content of the positions of Avakian and <br> Prachanda, to reveal that behind the “hermeneutic” difference there is, in fact, a convergence of <br> UOC (MLM) with these variants of revisionism in the 21st century. In essence, all revisionism supports <br> In one variant or another of bourgeois philosophy, for this is the conception of the world of capitulators. <br> Therefore, what are these statements of Avakian and Pachanda, but the denial of the law of contradiction, <br> denial of the principle that one is divided into two and the denial of the Marxist theory of knowledge? <br> 1- The establishment of the contradiction law in the process of development of the <br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism <br> The development of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, taken as the forge process of ideology <br> scientific of the proletariat, like every social and theoretical process is governed by the laws of dialectic and theory <br> Marxist of knowledge. Applying the law of contradiction to the Marxist theory of knowledge, the president <br> Mao develops Lenin's reflex theory by establishing that: <br><br><br> “People's social existence determines their thoughts. The correct ideas characteristic of <br> advanced class, once dominated by the masses, will become a material force to <br> transform society and the world. (…) In social struggles, the forces representing the class <br> advanced sometimes suffer from some failure, but not because their ideas are incorrect, <br> but because in the correlation of the forces in struggle, the advanced forces at the moment are not yet so <br> powerful as the reactionary, and therefore they fail temporarily, but they reach successful success <br> or afternoon. (…) In general, one can only achieve correct knowledge after many <br> reiterations of the process that leads from matter to consciousness and consciousness to matter, that is, <br> from practice to knowledge and knowledge to practice. This is the Marxist theory of knowledge, <br> This is the dialectical materialistic theory of knowledge. ” (President Mao) 16 <br> Social practice and knowledge conform the unity of contrary to the knowledge process. The social being <br> determines the thinking of men, in turn, the right ideas, when embodied by the masses, <br> convert to the material force capable of transforming the world. In its eternal development process, the <br> matter, under certain conditions, is reflected in thought, in the same way, in certain <br> Circumstances, thought becomes a material force. In addition, President Mao points out that the <br> knowledge process is not immediate, the right ideas do not fall from the sky, they can only be <br> incessant movement that leads from practice to knowledge and knowledge to practice. Like Lenin already <br> had established: <br> “Human representations about space and time are relative, but these representations <br> relative add up to the absolute truth, go to its development to the absolute truth and if <br> approach her. ” (Lenin) 17 <br> This successive process of approaching knowledge towards the truth occurs in the sciences <br> natural as in social science. For this reason, President Mao points out that in social struggles, social forces <br> Advanced may suffer setbacks, even if their ideas are correct. So that the correct ideas <br> triumph in the face of reactionary forces, it is necessary to exist certain objective conditions and the <br> construction of subjective factors for the jump and the new predominates over the old man and thus APLASTE, <br> which requires a certain time and accumulation of strength. Defeat for the new can only be temporary and, before <br> Sooner than late, it triumphs over the old man. This is the revolutionary conception of the world of the proletariat, this is <br> Marxist theory of knowledge formulated by Marx, developed and enhanced by Lenin and President <br> Hand. <br> The revisionist and renegade Avakian, has long shifted against such proletarian conception of <br> world. Assuming the revisionist conception of the Marxist theory of knowledge, Avakian considers <br> temporary defeats of the proletariat as being caused by "errors" in the ideology of the proletariat <br> International; and takes any error or insufficiency as a manifestation of philosophical conceptions <br> idealistic or metaphysical. In his stubborn search for errors, Avakian, the man who never misses anything<br>do, except to give vent to your “fantastic movement in the head”, identifies metaphysics errors in Marx, <br> Lenin and Mao. In addition, it presents the development of the stages of the ideology of the international proletariat, <br> As if each step essentially represented the “correction of errors and insufficiencies” of the preceding step. <br> Thus, Avakian takes the law of the contradiction of President Mao as a "correction" of use by Marx <br> of the denial of denial in the final part of Book I, of The Capital. This is another historical falsification woven <br> by Avakian, aiming to present himself as the general rectifier of errors in his pure, unbeaten and revisionist <br> “New synthesis of communism”. <br> The engine of the development of the ideology of the international proletariat is the social practice of class struggle. <br> It is in this contradiction between consciousness and practice that Marxism-Leninism-Maoism has forged itself and will follow <br> developing. It was in the struggle to transform the world that the titans of the international proletariat established <br> powerful truths for the class. Marx, Lenin and President Mao made mistakes in his practice? With <br> sure, but as great communist leaders rectified their errors as readily as possible, <br> mercilessly with their individual mistakes and inaccuracies. However, what is condemned in the definition of the <br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is the one that most agreed in the practice of these great leaders and in <br> revolutionary processes they guided by them. Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, therefore, is a set of <br> Truths as integral and harmonic doctrine and not a combination of two in one, of hits and errors. But <br> The ideology of the international proletariat, like everything in the universe, is one that is divided into two, is composed of <br><br><br> private truths and universal truths. Particular truths in Marx's thinking, in relation to the <br> time and the place where it was forged, that is, nineteenth and Europe respectively, from which universal laws, <br> With the passage of the capital of the internship of free competition to the stage of the monopolistic capital, they had to <br> be developed and overcome by the universal truths of Leninism, which has been developing Marxism <br> for the time of imperialism and the proletarian revolution and for regions where the capitalist productive forces or <br> Little existed or were still very late, the vast majority of nations oppressed by imperialism. From the <br> The same way, Maoism develops and surpasses the particular truths of Lenin's thinking, referent, <br> for example, the democratic revolution directed by the proletariat in Russia, where capitalism <br> developed, but where they still prevailed in vast regions late feudal and semi -feudal relations, but <br> It was an autocratic empire that opposed dozens of other nations and peoples and, therefore, fighting <br> Russian bourgeoisie itself. Thus President Mao establishes a more universal truth, the revolution <br> new democratic-bourgeois, the revolution of new democracy, as an inseparable and necessary part of the <br> world proletarian revolution, for all colonial and semicolonial countries. The brilliant definition of <br> Maoism established by President Gonzalo, with the direction of the Popular War in Peru, constituted <br> precisely the accurate delimitation of the universal truths contained in the thinking of Mao TStung generated from <br> Integration of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese Revolution. <br> The process of developing the formulation of the contradiction law, in the course of the three stages of <br> development of the ideology of the international proletariat, follows the same laws as dialectic and theory <br> Marxist of knowledge. Of correct initial formulations, they acquire greater accuracy in the extent <br> that accumulate greater experience in the social transformation process of the struggle for production, the struggle of <br> classes and scientific experimentation. Therefore, there is no inconsistency between the law of contradiction <br> fully established by President Mao in the contradiction, in 1937, and the dialectic or “the logic <br> of the capital ”. What happened in Marxist philosophy was the process of closer approximation of the “representations <br> relative ”towards the absolute truth. <br> 1.1- The development of philosophical formulation in the course of the first stage of the ideology of the proletariat <br> International <br> The philosophical richness of Marx and Engels' work is gigantic. There is no doubt that your proletarian conception <br> of the world, developed philosophically as dialectical materialism, was fully forged between the years of <br> 1845 to 1848. There are works such as the Holy Family and Theses on Feuerbach (1845), ideology <br> German (1846), misery of philosophy and wage labor and capital (1847) and the party manifesto <br> Communist (1848). In this spectacular set of works, in which the scientific ideology of the <br> international proletariat against bourgeois and reactionary ideology, the foundations of the<br>Marx's thought, that is, of the nascent communism. It is contained in the rupture and reckoning with the <br> Hegelians, the critique of the absolute system of Hegel's philosophy and the a-historical limits of the <br> Materialism of Feuerbach; The first elaboration of dialectical historical materialism; the beginning of <br> economic investigations; Criticism against Proudhon's Small Burge Socialism; and the theory of <br> proletarian revolution presented to the European working class on the eve of the great wave of revolutions <br> democratic that swept the European continent in 1848. <br> The theoretical and philosophical development of Marxism, however, did not end there. After years of <br> arduous undeliable theoretical work of revolutionary practice, Marx would publish another spectacular sequence of <br> Works: Book I of The Capital (1867), the Civil War in France (1871), the criticism of Gotha's program <br> (1875) and, together with Engels, a last preface to the Communist Party Manifesto (1882), in which they address <br> The question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, hitherto absent in the manifesto. While Engels, secondary Marx, <br> Publish anti-dühring (1877-78), Book II and III of The Capital (1885 and 1894, respectively), the origin <br> Family, private property and state (1884), as well as Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of philosophy <br> German classic (1886) and would leave without publishing the important work the dialectic of nature (written between 1878- <br> 88). This set of works, in addition to its correspondences and various notes, completely complete <br> splendid the theoretical formulation of the first stage of the ideology of the international proletariat in its three <br> constitutive parts as unity: Marxist philosophy, Marxist political economy and socialism <br> scientific. The most important scientific work is undoubtedly capital, in its four books. However, <br> after the publication of Book I is greatly advanced in the Marxist theory about the state, in the matter of the dictatorship of <br> proletariat, of the condition of socialism as the lower stage of communism. Advances against the source <br><br><br> Revisionism expressed in the influences of Lassalle and Dühring on German social democracy. And also, with <br> Engels, the philosophical question, which establishes the central issues that would be necessary to be <br> Developed in Marxist philosophy: the theory of knowledge and dialectic. Tasks are assumed and <br> fulfilled by Lenin and President Mao. <br> In the present philosophical controversy and the eclectic management that UOC (MLM) makes the denial of denial, well <br> as in the unmasking of the philosophical falsifications of Avakian and Pachanda, the most important <br> Analysis of the development of Marxist philosophy, particularly in the works Capital and Anti-Dühring. <br> As part of the work of cleaning the land to reach the essence of revisionist conceptions and so <br> after the root, it is decisive to clarify the content that Marx employs the denial of denial in the <br> Capital and what is the real weight of this employment in the whole work. To clarify this content, the work <br> of Engels is fundamental, because one of the attacks from Dühring to Marx is precisely around the use of <br> denial of denial to explain the “expropriation of the expropriates”. The philosophical part of the controversy of <br> Marx against Proudhon is also very important for understanding the revisionist content of the use of <br> denial of denial, as well as about Marx's conception about this. <br> Let's look at Marx's use of denial of denial in the final part of The Capital. He starts <br> presenting the question as follows: <br> “Private property, antithesis of collective, social property, exists only when the instrumental and the <br> Other external conditions of the work belong to individuals. Assumes different character as <br> These individuals are workers or not. The innumerable shades that private property <br> offers at first glance only the intermediate states that exist between these two <br> extremes, the private property of workers and non-workers. ”(Marx) 18 <br> Marx initially starts from the opposition between collective property and private property, and soon <br> in the analysis of private property on production instruments and other external conditions of the <br> work. Then divides the process of development of private property into two aspects <br> Contradictory: the private property of workers versus private property of non-workers. <br> Then Marx analyzes what were the historical conditions in which the private property of workers <br> on the very means of production existed as a dominant aspect in society in relation to <br> private property of non-workers: <br> “Worker ownership on the means of production serves as a basis for small industry (…) <br> But it only flourishes, only develops all its energies, only conquers the proper classic form<br>when the worker is a free owner of working conditions (means and object of work) <br> with which it operates, namely, the peasant owns the land that cultivates, the artisan, of the instruments that <br> manage with expertise. ” (Marx) 19 <br> Historically, Marx is referring to the process of decomposition of feudalism, of loosening <br> bonds of servitude, in which peasants and artisans become free owners; Specifically, it is <br> referring to the late fifteenth century in England. However, the development of this mode of production <br> based on the private property of workers from their own individual labor instruments <br> due to their own particular characteristics engenders the contradiction that leads to its dissolution: <br> “This mode of production presupposes land parceling and dispersion of other means of production. (…) <br> Has come to a degree of development, this mode of production generates the material means of its <br> own annihilation. (…) Its destruction, the transformation of the means of production individually <br> scattered in socially concentrated, the tiny property of many on the property <br> gigantic of few, the expropriation of the large mass of the population, stripped of their lands, their <br> means of subsistence and their work instruments, this terrible and difficult expropriation, constitutes <br> the prehistory of capital. (…) Private property, obtained with personal effort, based on <br> thus to the identification of the isolated and independent individual worker with his <br> working conditions, is supplanted by the capitalist private property, based on the <br> exploitation of the work of others ”. (Marx) 20 <br> The contrary unit between the two extremes of private property, identified by Marx, means of <br> production belonging to workers versus private ownership of non-workers is denied <br> by its own development. Workers are expropriated from their means of production and the <br><br><br> private property dominant becomes the property of non-workers, which takes the form of <br> capitalist property. This first denial gives rise to a new process, in which the aspects <br> contradictory are: capitalist private property (as dominant) and an increasingly social production <br> (as a dominated aspect). The development of this new unit of opposing contrary will engender the second <br> denial that will inaugurate a third process. <br> As indicated in the quotation above, for Marx, the expropriation of free workers <br> of production is the prehistory of capital. This expropriation corresponds to the transformation of <br> workers in proletarians and their working conditions in capital, aspects that configure the mode of <br> capitalist production. In this new process, another expropriation process develops, which is the <br> expropriation between the capitalists themselves, called by Marx of centralization of capital. At the <br> development of capitalism, owners of the best production conditions tend to bring <br> capitalists competing for bankruptcy and then expropriated them centralize the means of production in <br> increasingly restricted number of bourgeois. The centralization of capital in turn drives the aspect <br> Opposite of contradiction, that is, the socialization of production, which becomes increasing, develops like this: <br> “(…) The cooperative form of the work process, the conscious application of science to progress <br> technological, the planned exploitation of the soil, the transformation of the means of work that can only be <br> used in common ”21. Thus social means of work increasingly monopolized by <br> a small class of capitalists, this way: <br> “The monopoly of capital starts to burg the mode of production that flourished with him and under him. A <br> centralization of the means of production and the socialization of work achieve a point where <br> make it incompatible with the capitalist wrap. The enclosure breaks. Sounds the final time of <br> Capitalist private property. The expropriates are expropriated. ” (Marx) 22 <br> The contradiction between capitalist property and the social character of production reaches a level of <br> development, which is sharpened the struggle for its resolution, the expropriation of the expropriates is the denial <br> From this unit of opposites, it is a second denial, therefore, a denial of denial. Marx summarizes <br> first and second denial in the following terms: <br> “The capitalist mode of appropriateness of the goods, resulting from the capitalist mode of production, that is, the <br> capitalist private property, is the first denial of individual private property based on the <br> own work. But capitalist production generates its own denial, with the fatality of a <br> natural process. It is the denial of denial. This second denial does not restore property<br>private, but individual property based on the conquest of the capitalist era: the <br> cooperation and common possession of soil and means of production generated by their own work. <br> The transformation of sparse private property, based on the work proper to individuals, into <br> capitalist private property, naturally constitutes a much longer, harder and more <br> more difficult than the transformation into social property of capitalist property than <br> effectively is already based on a collective mode of production. ” (Marx) 23 <br> The first denial (expropriation of workers from their own means of production) constitutes the <br> History of Capital; The second negation (expropriation of the expropriates) is the end of capital. A <br> capitalist property dominates social production, puts social productive forces (workers and means <br> production) under your control; the social character of production denies this unity of opposites and inaugurates a <br> new process, the communist society that does not reestablish private property under the means of production, <br> but institutes social property over them. The denial of denial does not governs development <br> contradiction, it explains the development and solution of two or more contradictions in a process <br> sequential contrary units. This is the denial of the denial used by Marx, in The Capital. <br> Defenestrated, on the one hand, by the renegade Avakian, for considering it “determinism” and “expression of <br> religious metaphysics in Marxism ”, and, on the other hand, chosen by UOC (MLM) as the“ General Law of <br> dialectic that best explains the direction of the movement ”, as it would demonstrate that“ each advance is in turn <br> a setback ”24. Both positions are fakes of Marxism. Let's see. <br> Marx analyzes here the historical movement taken in its large course, has five centuries of <br> humanity development, three great interconnected social processes, past, present and future: <br> owners of individual production means, capitalists owners of social media of <br><br><br> Production, owner workers (social property) of social means of production. Marx analyzes three <br> forms of ownership of these means of production: individual property, capitalist property and <br> social property. Describes as denial of denial three distinct historical processes. Would be the great <br> Marx in divergence with the law of contradiction in presenting the course of history? No. <br> President Mao shows that the processes are placed on each other, also, according to the Law of <br> contradiction: <br> “All processes have a beginning and an end, all processes become their <br> contrary. The permanence of all processes is relative, while their variability, <br> expressed in the transformation of one process into another, it is absolute. ” (President Mao) 25 <br> In turn, describing the suppression of capitalist private property, in the form of denial of denial, is <br> The most developed and complete way to describe this movement and its direction? No, because in this way <br> analyzes different historical processes in a succession of contrary units, such as historical sequence <br> broader, without analyzing in detail the fundamental contradiction of the present process to be transformed, this <br> Yeah, the capitalist society. That is, the denial of denial corresponds to the successive resolution of two <br> contradictory units, each corresponding to a distinct historical process and the emergence of a <br> third process, in this case the Communist Society. The table below illustrates this sequence: <br> Decomposition of <br> feudalismalisocapitalism communism <br> Private propriety <br> of workers on <br> the means of production 1st Denterers with proprietors and capitalist propriety (form <br> developed property <br> private non-workers) 2nd denial and expropriation of the social propriares of the means of production <br> (Proper form of property <br> to the social character of production) <br> versus versus versus <br> Private propriety <br> non-work social production individual from workers <br> on consumer goods <br> The denial of denial, therefore, is nothing more than the sequential resolution of two contrary units, <br> of two distinct and chained social processes, which in turn relate to contradictory unit <br> among themselves (process of decomposition of feudalism versus process of emergence and development of <br> capitalism). Denial of denial, therefore, is a particular case or a form of manifestation of the law of <br> contradiction. As a particular case it cannot be the best way to explain the direction of the movement. This <br> is evident in the very development of the ideology of the international proletariat in its first stage, in the <br> Engels' struggle against Dühring's falsifications in his attack on Marxism, especially against the <br> Capital.<br>Another important aspect to understand is the content of denial in Marx, because it is the same <br> by President Mao on the contradiction. That is, for Marx, the denial of a unit of contrary <br> by another unit of contrary, corresponds to the suppression of the old aspect by the new and not to a <br> combination or reconciliation of the struggle aspects, much less a breakthrough that is at the same time <br> setback, as advocated to UOC (MLM). To assimilate the revolutionary and non -conservative content of the <br> Denial on Marx, it is quite useful to resume the brilliant refutation of Engels to Dühring. This socialist of <br> Chair, criticizing this same passage from the capital, says slanderously that: <br> “(…) The denial of Hegelian denial had to provide here the midwife services, for which the <br> Future is gone through the belly of the past. The suppression of individual property, which in the way <br> Indicated has occurred since the sixteenth century, it is the first denial. It will be followed by a second, <br> which is characterized as denial of denial and, consequently, as a restoration of the <br> 'Individual property', only in a higher form, founded on the common possession of the land and <br> of the means of work. The fact that this new 'individual property' is called too, <br> simultaneously, by mr. Marx of 'social property' highlights the highest unity of Hegel, in the <br> what contradiction is overcome, namely, according to a joke with the words, it would be so much <br> surpassed as preserved. (…) Mr. Marx remains confident in the hazy world of his <br> ownership both individual and social and lets its adherents solve, they <br> themselves, the deep dialectical puzzle. ” (Dühring apud Engels) 26 <br><br><br> Dühring's falsification lies in presenting the denial of denial in Marx, as identical to the system <br> Hegelian conservative. So, according to Dühring, the denial of Marxist denial would consist of <br> simultaneous overcoming and conservation of private property, or in a synthesis between individual property and <br> social property. Engels rejects this falsifying interpretation of Marx's dialectic as if it were equal to <br> Denial of Hegelian denial; referring to a previous text by Dühring, Engels says he had <br> “(…) Committed the gaffe of identifying the Marxist dialectic with the Hegelian dialectic” 27. About <br> Dürhinguiana falsification presented above, Engels refutes it specifically as follows: <br> “(…) Here he can, without working hard, correct Marx according to Hegel, imputing him <br> higher unit of a property on which Marx did not say a word. (…) The state <br> instituted by the expropriation of the expropriates (…) means that social property covers <br> land and other means of production and individual property covers other products, or <br> that is, the consumer objects. ” (Engels) 28 <br> Engels irrefutably clarifies the revolutionary meaning of Marx's use of denial of denial. <br> This is not a conciliation of contradictions, much less a synthesis (taken in the sense of a <br> combination between opposites) between social property and individual property. The expropriation of <br> Exproprianers to Marx is the full suppression of capitalist private property, and with this one throws in the trash <br> of history all private property of the means of production, either its capitalist form is its form of <br> small owners. What continues to exist in communism is the social production that finds in the <br> Social property the only appropriate form of property. However, by abolishing the private property of <br> means of production, social production becomes another historical process, thus modifying its <br> essence. With the end of the social classes, the social division of labor is also ended, the difference between <br> workers and peasants, between field and city, between intellectual work and manual work, process that <br> will charge a long transition course from capitalism to communism, from proletariat dictatorship, period of <br> Permanent Revolution, as Marx defined. Communist production, based on the socialization of production <br> previous, will reach an unprecedented degree of development in history will culminate the departure of humanity <br> from the kingdom of necessity and entry into the kingdom of freedom: human emancipation. But there will be contradictions <br> In communism? Obviously, social antagonism has ended, the struggle between the new and the old man is incessant and <br> infinite, as well as between the right and the wrong, as well as the struggle in a multitude of things and phenomena, such <br> as Marx states that there will continue to be contradiction between social production and the need <br> individual consumer, the permanent struggle for production overcoming consumption is a condition for <br> Fulfill the communist motto of each according to their ability and each according to their need. This one<br>motto will not be reached by the reconciliation of the contradiction, because only the fight can solve any <br> contradiction, whether antagonistic or non-antagonistic. <br> Both Avakian and Pachanda and also UOC (MLM) conclude that the content of denial of denial <br> In Marx is the same described slanderously by Dühring, that is, as if it were a thesis <br> Antithesis-synthesis, in which synthesis is a combination or conciliation of the opposite aspects. In publication <br> relatively recent the PCR-UUSA states that: <br> “In the original conception of the historical development of society until communism, including the <br> Marx's formulations, there was a tendency (…) to have a somewhat narrow and linear view. Per <br> example, manifests itself in the concept of 'denial of denial' (the idea that things develop from <br> way that a particular thing is denied by something else, which in turn leads to another denial and <br> A synthesis that end elements of previous things, but at a higher level). (…) As <br> has sustained Bob Avakian, the 'denial of denial' can tend to 'inevitabilism' - as if <br> one thing had to deny other things in a specific way, leading to what is almost a <br> predetermined synthesis. ” (PCR-UUS) 29 <br> Renegade and falsifiers, repeat the same argument as Dühring against Marx, as if the denial of <br> denial in capital indicated a synthesis at a higher level, where elements of <br> previous things. Avakian turns against an alleged “inevitabilism” of denial of denial, only to <br> hide that it rises against “inevitabilism” of the law of contradiction fully established by the President <br> Hand. After all, it is defined in the law of contradiction by President Mao, and not in the denial of denial, that: the <br> Substitution of the old with the new is the “general and imprescriptible law of the universe”. The anti -this Avakian aims at <br> Marx, but also seeks to hit President Mao. <br><br><br> Prachanda and the direction of UOC (MLM), in turn, defend the denial of denial in the slanderous sense of <br> Dühring as if this were the true and used by Marx and Engels. These say that: “The movement does not <br> It is a linear way but as apparent cycles, in which each advance is in turn <br> setback ”. Already the renegade pachanda, falsifies that: <br> “Finally, by synthesizing the Nepalese communist movement, it can be said that this march below <br> forging a new unit on a new base, according to the dialectical principle of the unit <br> transformation, or thesis-antithesis-synthesis. (…) The full process of the Nepalese communist movement <br> It can also be seen as a denial of denial. ” (PRACHANDA) 30 <br> Prachanda clearly takes this slanderous interpretation of Dühring about the denial of denial in Marx <br> to substantiate their rotten merger theory, updated version of the old theory of reconciliation of <br> contradictions. Lenin, like Engels, also makes clear the revolutionary and non -conciliatory meaning of <br> denial of denial in Marx: <br> “However, this idea, as they formulated Marx and Engels, supporting themselves in Hegel, is very vast and <br> rich of content than the current idea of evolution. It is a development that seems to repeat <br> Steps already traveled, but on another base, on a higher base ('denial of denial'); one <br> Development so to speak in spiral, not in a straight line; a leap development, by <br> catastrophes, by revolutions; ‘Continuity Solutions’; quantity transformations in quality; <br> internal impulses of development, caused by contradiction, the shock of forces and <br> distinct trends acting on a particular body, in the framework of a particular phenomenon or in the <br> of a particular society (…). ” (Lenin) 31 <br> Only one counterfeit like Avakian can say that the denial of denial in Marx is a combination <br> among the opposite aspects of a contradiction. As makes clear Lenin, the dialectical movement in spiral <br> Ascending only in appearance repeats steps already traveled, there is therefore not in the denial of denial in <br> Marx nothing that represents a resurrection of the past, or a conciliation between past and present in the <br> future for which we fight. <br> Marx himself, in the misery of philosophy (1847) already criticized the conciliatory use of Proudhon of the denial of <br> Denial as a way of merging opposite aspects in a contradiction. In this work, Marx rocks the positions <br> Breakfasts of Proudhon, who in two previous books had sought to apply a dialectic <br> conciliatory to criticism of political economy and utopian socialism. In your work what is the property? , in <br> 1840, Proudhon in an idealist manner begins by criticizing the legal concept of ownership and not its <br> Material existence. The foundation of its anarchist society is: “It suppresses property conserving the <br> possession, and with only this modification there will be completely changed the laws, the government, the institutions,<br>You shall have eliminated the evil of the earth ”32. Suppress ownership and maintain private possession of the means of <br> Production, here is the Proudhonian application of the denial of conservative denial to criticism of political economy. <br> In the book System of Economic Contradictions, 1846, Proudhon expands his attempt to apply the dialectic <br> idealistic to political economy, seeking to deduce all economic categories through what he <br> considered a dialectical method. <br> In his answer, Marx briefly presents Proudhon's miserable attempt to apply the denial of <br> denial as conciliation of contradictions: <br> “The material of economists is the active and active life of men; The material of mr. Proudhon are the <br> dogmas of economists. But from the moment the historical movement is not pursued <br> production relations, of which the categories are only the theoretical expression, from the moment <br> where one wants to see in these categories only ideas, spontaneous thoughts, independent of <br> real relations, from then on if it is forced to consider the movement of reason pure the origin <br> of these thoughts. <br> (…) <br> Impersonal reason, having neither outside nor land in which it can be placed nor object to which <br> Opposition, you can be forced to a somersault, putting yourself, opposing and composing-position, opposition, <br> composition. To speak Greek, we have thesis, antithesis and synthesis. As for those who are unaware of <br> Hegelian language, we will tell them the sacramental formula: affirmation, negation and denial of <br> denial." (Marx) 33 <br><br><br> Marx clearly unravels with Proudhon's Small Burguean dialectic, which takes denial of denial, <br> by the thesis-antithesis-synthesis and synthesis form as the composition between the opposite aspects of a <br> contradiction. The denial of the proudhonian denial has the result of anarchy, a composition between the <br> suppression of private property and the conservation of private possession of the means of production. This formula <br> idealistic and conservative criticized by Marx, it was precisely what Dühring slanderously attributes <br> to him; And it is precisely the way Avakian and Pachanda falsify as if it correspond to the use of Marx <br> in The Capital. <br> Prachanda falsifies the content of denial of denial in Marx, as if it were identical to the “dialectic” <br> Small Burgue, because what he assumes in essence is the denial of Proudhon's denial. As follows <br> Marx's criticism, made in 1847, the Proudhonian dialectic, fully serves as a full critique of the theory of <br> fusion of renegade pachanda: <br> “(…) Since reason has been able to put itself as a thesis, this thesis, this thought, opposite to <br> Even, it unfolds in two contradictory, positive and negative thoughts, yes and no. A <br> Fight of these two antagonistic elements, understood in the antithesis, constitutes the dialectical movement. <br> Yes becoming no, not becoming, yes, becoming simultaneously yes and no, no <br> Becoming simultaneously not, but the opposites balance, neutralize, paralyze. A <br> fusion of these two contradictory elements is a new thinking, which is their synthesis. That <br> new thinking unfolds still in two contradictory thoughts that, in turn, <br> merge into a new synthesis. (…) Mr. Proudhon, despite all his great effort to climb the <br> contradiction system, never managed to move from the first two steps of the thesis and the <br> Simple antithesis and, moreover, it only reached them twice - in one of them, it fell on its back. ” (Marx) 34 <br> The “fusion of these two contradictory elements” as a superior synthesis that appears in the Marxist work of <br> Criticism of Proudhon's Small Burger Socialism represents the precise description of philosophical forgery <br> of Prachanda, which first implies philosophy, in the so -called fusion theory and then culminating <br> explicitly and shamefully in the political sphere, in the capitulation of the popular war, in the proposition of <br> a “joint dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie” 35. In his overwhelming critique of Proudhon, Marx <br> refutes the entire attempt to conciliate and merge the contradictions, shows that society to the present moved <br> if through the struggle of opposites, through the antagonistic struggle of opposites, and only through this struggle <br> can solve your contradictions: <br> “In the course of its development, the laborious class will replace the old civil society with a <br> association that will exclude the classes and their antagonism, and there will be no more political power <br> Said, since political power is precisely the official summary of the antagonism of civil society. <br> However, the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a class struggle against <br> Another, one struggle that led to its highest expression is a total revolution. In addition, it is <br> provoke astonishment that a society based on the opposition of classes leads to brutal contradiction, <br> a melee shock as a final solution? Do not say that the social movement excludes the<br>political movement. There is never a political movement other than socially. <br> Only an order of things in which there are no more classes and class antagonisms <br> Social evolutions will no longer be political revolutions. Until then, on the eve of each general reorganization <br> of society, the last word of social science will always be: ‘Combat or death, the struggle <br> bloody or nothingness. This is how the issue is irresistibly posed '(George Sand). ” (Marx) 36 <br> Marxist dialectic is explicit: only the struggle of contrary and not its reconciliation can solve the <br> contradictions inherent to bourgeois society. This is the same conception of the world, the same philosophy, <br> Present in The Capital, the expropriation of the expropriates is the final time of capitalist property; The <br> denial of denial is therefore not for Marx the conciliation of contradictions, but its resolution <br> revolutionary through the irreconcilable struggle. <br> Clarified the content of the denial of the denial used by Marx, it remains only to evaluate the weight of its <br> use in the whole work. In Book I, of The Capital, Marx only uses the denial of <br> denial. Therefore, the philosophical core of the capital cannot be summarized to the denial of denial. All the <br> Capital is based on the dialectical law of unity and struggle of the opposites and its content can be more <br> easily seized and popularized from the Maoist principle that one is divided into two. <br><br><br> Marx, in studying the concrete phenomenon of capitalism, had to analyze him in his two aspects <br> contradictory, the process of capitalist production (presented in the book I) and the process of circulation <br> capitalist (presented in book II), being the production process the dominant aspect that determines in <br> Last instance the mode of circulation of capital. In Book I, therefore, Marx Abstrai, insofar as this is <br> Possible, the influence of circulation phenomena on production. This abstraction cannot be absolute, <br> because the law of value itself, which precedes the emergence of the capitalist mode of production, results from the interaction <br> Between the two contradictory aspects: production and circulation. In Book II, Marx abstracts, in the same way, the <br> effects of the production process in the sphere of circulation, in order to understand the circulation of the <br> Capital, which is the value endowed with added value. Finally, Marx analyzes the relationship between these two aspects in the <br> Book III: the global process of capitalist production, where the result of the unity and the struggle between <br> mode of production and the circulation mode, becoming possible for Marx to study the operation <br> Concrete of the profit rate, the Mais-Valia Distribution Law in the capitalist mode of production. <br> In analyzing the process of capitalist production, Marx starts from the most concrete element, the unit more <br> primary and historically preceded capital, the commodity. Demonstrates how goods is a <br> Unit of two contradictory aspects: the use value and the value of exchange or value, that is, one that is divided <br> in two, and demonstrates how the development of the division of labor and increasing exchanges, make the value <br> of exchange or value the dominant aspect in this contradiction. It also demonstrates the double character of work <br> materialized in the goods: the concrete work that produces use value, and the abstract work that <br> constitutes the substance of the value of the goods. Concludes, in turn, that the exchange value is the form of the value <br> and by analyzing the contradictory development of value in its form reaches the money form, in which, more <br> Once one is divided into two. In the money form of the value, the unit between use value and value of <br> exchange in the goods; money, in its most developed form, consists of a merchandise whose only <br> Utility is to serve as a general equivalent or measure of value among other goods. Show how the <br> money drives exchanges and how this growth raises the social division of labor, then as the <br> quantitative accumulation of values in the Dinean form, within a set of other social relations, <br> determines the transformation of money into capital. <br> Marx then analyzes how capital is a value that is divided into two opposite aspects: constant and variable. <br> And as in the production process, the constant capital reproduces its own value, while capital <br> Variable, when buying workforce, through this produces a new value. This new value, in turn, <br> It is also one that is divided into two: one aspect is the reproduction of the salary, the other is the production of the most <br> It was worth, that is, the part of the new value created that is appropriate by the capitalist without costing anything to him. More- <br> It is also worth it into two contradictory aspects: additional capital and consumer fund <br> of the capitalist, which are the individual expenses of the bourgeois, luxury and for its maintenance. The additional capital<br>It corresponds to the phenomenon of expanded reproduction which is the transformation of capital value into capital. More- <br> Valia constitutes the particular, specific product of the capitalist mode of production; Its production conditions and is <br> conditioned by free competition. The production of surplus value, on the one hand, and free competition for <br> another, they determine that capitalist production needs to always reproduce itself in a broad manner in order to <br> Maintain the production of added value, that is, the capitalist's profit. The necessary result of the production of <br> value under the free competition is a growing capitalist accumulation and, consequently, a high <br> Centralization of capital. Capitalist accumulation and centralization of capital, by raising its composition <br> Organic, result in the final product of the capitalist mode of production: surplus overpopulation. Like this, <br> thus the expanded reproduction of capital inevitably leads, on the one hand, to the expropriation of the capitalists <br> by the capitalists themselves, and, on the other, the production of the colossal mass of miserables that will, in their time, <br> necessarily expropriate the capitalists and throw private property of the means of production in the <br> history. <br> This development of the contradiction and the process of which one is divided into two, in the capital, can be <br> Thus represented: <br><br><br> constant capital (c) → means of production → transfers value (c) <br> Reproduction Employee Capitarallevation of Organic Composition and Centralization of CapitalCapital (K) <br> Variable Capital (V) → Force of → WorkNOVALOVALEProduct (V) <br> Producemais-value (m) Additional Capital Production Desuperpopulation. <br> Marx's great work, capital, therefore, is not based on the denial of denial, but in the law <br> of contradiction. For this reason, President Mao points out: <br> “As Lenin pointed out, Marx gave the capital a model of analysis of the movement of <br> contrary, which runs through the whole process of developing one thing from the beginning to the <br> end." (President Mao) 37 <br> AND: <br> “By applying the law of contradiction to things to the study of the socio-historical process, Marx and Engels <br> discovered the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, the contradiction between the <br> exploiting and exploited classes (…). <br> In applying this law to the study of the economic structure of capitalist society, Marx found that the <br> fundamental contradiction of this society is the contradiction between the social character of production and the character <br> private property. ” (President Mao) 38 <br> That is, Marx brilliantly applied the law of contradiction to the study of capitalist society. Just no <br> He had time to form it in a separate philosophical work. <br> As seen, the use of the denial of denial by Marx in the capital is only a form <br> Private contradiction law in the analysis of the suppression of capitalist private property. Is important <br> note how Marxist philosophical formulation develops in anti-dühring, as part of the two <br> lines against metaphysical conceptions within German social democracy. The work anti-dühring is <br> Divided into three great sections: philosophy, political economy and scientific socialism; Engels presents, <br> Thus, for the first time, the doctrine of the proletariat in full, in its three constitutive parts. O <br> book as a whole from the point of view of the development of Marxist philosophy advances the denial of <br> Revolutionary denial for the law of contradiction. <br> In the first section, when refuting the falsification of Dühring, Engels, as already seen, still has the suppression <br> private property in the form of the denial of revolutionary denial. However, when returning to the same <br> theme, in the last section of the work, scientific socialism, Engels no longer deals with the suppression of property <br> capitalist taking the wide course of history, but in detail the contradiction <br> fundamental of capitalist society. Expressing this development of Marxist philosophy, Engels <br> presents the same phenomenon, described in The Capital, now, from the unit of contrary to the process <br> capitalist, of its resolution, or revolutionary denial: <br> “The bourgeoisie (...) would not be able to transform the limited means of production into <br> powerful productive without tearing them from their fragmentation and dispersion, without concentrating them, <br> without converting them from the means of production of the individual to social production, which <br> can only be applied by a set of people. <br> (...) <br> Means of production and production become essentially social. But they are subjected <br> to a mode of appropriation that presupposes the private production of individuals, <br> where each has the product and takes it to the market. The mode of production is <br> submitted to this mode of appropriation (...). In this contradiction, which lends to the new <br> mode of production its capitalist character, resides embryoly the entire clash of the <br> present." (Engels) 39<br>That is, means of production only socially operated and a “essentially collective” mode of production <br> in contradiction with the mode of appropriation, that is, with the regime of private property, with the property <br> capitalist. And Engels points out that “in this contradiction” embryoly resides the entire clash today. <br> And so, this great Titan of the proletariat goes on: <br> “The division between the means of production concentrated in the hands of the capitalists, <br> on the one hand, and the producer reduced to possession of nothing but his own workforce, <br> other. The contradiction between social production and capitalist appropriation has emerged as <br> antagonism between proletariat and bourgeoisie. ” (Engels) 40 <br> Engels clearly presents the fundamental contradiction of the process, its economic base: production <br> Social versus private appropriation and its social expression: proletariat versus bourgeoisie. Departing <br> centrally of the contradiction of the process of capitalist society, and no longer the denial of denial in <br> succession chained from two units of contrary from different historical processes, Engels explains the <br> overproduction crises, from the development of the same fundamental contradiction: <br> “In crises, the contradiction between social production and capitalist appropriation <br> Violent rash. The circulation of goods is momentarily annihilated; the middle <br> circulation, money becomes impediment of circulation; all laws of production of <br> Goods and the circulation of goods are turned upside down. The shock <br> economic reaches its highlight: the mode of production rebels against the mode of exchange, <br> the productive forces rebel against the mode of production in which they originated. ” <br> (Engels) 41 <br> And the resolution of this contradiction, between social productive forces and private property, between the mode of <br> Production and circulation mode, it is presented by Marx and Engels in this way in anti-dühring: <br> “[Social productive forces] once understood in their nature, they can, in the hands <br> of associated producers, being transformed from demonic dominators into servants <br> obedient (...). Treat the current productive forces according to their nature finally identified <br> means replacing social anarchy of production with socially regulation <br> planned production according to the needs of both the whole and each <br> individual; Thus, the mode of capitalist appropriation, in which the product enslaves <br> first the producer and then also who appropriates him, is replaced by the mode of <br> appropriation of products founded on the nature of the means of production: <br> one side, directly social appropriation as means of support and expansion of the <br> production and, on the other, directly individual appropriation as life and <br> fruition." (Engels) 42 <br> Engels presents in detail the form of resolution of the fundamental contradiction, in its economic aspect, <br> social property of the means of production and planning. And from the political point of view: “The proletariat <br> assumes the power of the state and transforms the means of production primarily into state ownership ”43. <br> The presentation of the suppression of private property, assumes its classic formula for the proletariat <br> International in this presentation of Engels, later popularized in the work of utopian socialism to the <br> Scientific Socialism (1880). In the capital the suppression of private property had to be presented to <br> from the sequential and chained resolution of two contrary units; DENATION OF THE FIRST UNIT <br> Capitalism arises, from the denial of the second unity, capitalism is destroyed. This initial explanation was <br> accurate from the scientific point of view, correct from the philosophical point of view, but needed to be deepened and is <br> This that occurs through the struggle of two lines against Dühring's position. Presenting, the suppression of <br> capitalist property focusing on the analysis of the fundamental contradiction of capitalist society, allowed <br> present in greater detail the content and shape of the proletarian revolution. Present the historical movement <br> Ascending from the law of contradiction, it was at the same time more concrete and more universal. This <br> constituted an important development of Marxist philosophy in the course of the first stage of <br> Development of the ideology of the international proletariat. <br> This development, however, was not only the product of the ideological struggle against chair socialism, but <br> also from the progress of the class struggle, after all, revolutionary philosophy advances and will always advance in <br> seeks to transform reality. Capital was published in 1867, the anti-dühring, is published <br><br><br> fully, only in 1878. In this small historical interval, there were great episodes <br> for the world proletarian revolution and fights of two very important lines in the nascent MCI. In 1871,<br>the immortal commune of Paris occurs, with the direct intervention of I International, under the personal direction of <br> Marx, even though it is the minority Marxists in the direction of the commune; and in 1875, it emerges the very important struggle of <br> Two lines against Lassalismo in Germany. Of the first, Marx formulates the powerful war document <br> civil in France, in which it highlights, that the Paris Commune had solved the historical problem of <br> state of the dictatorship of the proletariat; of the second, Marx establishes in criticism of the Gotha program that the <br> Construction of communism would go through a first stage, that of socialist society; in which after <br> socialization of the means of production, invariably, it would be necessary to fight the still current right <br> bourgeois and the social division of labor, particularly against the differences between field and city, between <br> workers and peasants and between manual and intellectual labor, differences that are expression of <br> existence of antagonistic classes in socialism. <br> In The Capital, as Marx's goal was to demonstrate the historical need for the expropriation of <br> Expropriating, he takes it, related to three qualitatively distinct social processes. So, under <br> form of denial of denial between these processes, the expropriation of the expropriates appears as a <br> act. After the commune of Paris and its correct balance in civil war in France, after criticism of the program <br> of Gotha, to the theoretical and practical development of ideology, in the struggle against Dühring, it was evident that the <br> question could not be replaced on the same terms. For this reason, the expropriation of the expropriates is <br> now presented as a process, in which it is necessary to comply with certain steps. A <br> expropriation of expropriates as a process can only be presented philosophically through the law <br> of contradiction. <br> In anti-dühring, Engels presents a series of examples of denial of denial in different processes <br> development of nature, society and thought. These demonstrations were of great <br> philosophical importance, because by highlighting the universality of denial of denial in the different forms of <br> Movement of matter, Engels was unfurling the universality of dialectic. The formulation of <br> universality of dialectic was a necessary step towards the establishment of universality and <br> Absolute of the law of contradiction. And, therefore, the work of Engels in every way is an important <br> Progress for the development of Marxist philosophy. <br> However, although the denial of denial is present in all forms of movement of matter, it <br> It is not present in all phenomena as is the absolute term of the law of contradiction. Engels, after <br> present the universal aspect of denial of denial in the process of development of barley grain, <br> It also presents its particular aspect. Let us first see how Engels analyzes his validity <br> universal: <br> “Take a grain of barley. Billions of barley grains are ground, boiled, fermented and, <br> Then consumed. But if one of these grains of barley finds the conditions that are normal to it, <br> when falling into propitious soil, it occurs with it, under the influence of heat and humidity, a change well <br> Himself: He germinates; the grain disappears as such, is denied, and its place is taken by the plant that <br> It arose from it, which is the denial of the grain. But what is the normal course of life of this plant? It grows, <br> It flourish, is fertilized and finally produces other grains of barley; And so that these are <br> matured, his stalk will be and, in turn, is denied. As a result of this denial of <br> negation, we have again the initial barley grain, but not the simple grain, but a <br> Ten, twenty, thirty times larger. ” (Engels) 44 <br> The grain of barley is a unit of opposites that denied, under certain conditions, transforms <br> in a barley plant; this same plant, in turn, under certain conditions, grows, is fertilized and <br> It produces many other grains that deny the unity of opposites that constitute the plant. The grain is denied in <br> First denial, the plant is denied by the set of grains in the denial of denial. Two processes of <br> units of distinct and chained contrary that necessarily give rise to a third distinct from the two <br> that preceded them: the quantitative expansion of barley grains. Then Engels indicates the limits of this <br> sequential form of movement: <br> “In dialectic, denying does not simply mean not to say or declare that something does not exist or <br> destroy it in any way. Spinosa already said: Omnis determinatio est negatio, all <br> Delimitation or determination is at the same time denial. And, moreover, the type of denial is <br><br><br> determined here, first, by the universal nature of the process and, secondly, by its <br> specific nature. I should not only deny it, but also to revoke denial. I owe, therefore,<br>Establish the first denial in such a way that the second remains or becomes possible. As? <br> Always in accordance with the specific nature of each individual case. When a grain of <br> Barley, when I crush an insect, in fact makes the first act, but makes the second unfeasible. ” <br> (Engels) 45 <br> This is the particularity of denial of denial: the first unit of opposites must be denied <br> specific way to ensure the possibility of second denial. In this case the denial of <br> negation may explain the natural, spontaneous growth of barley, but not the phenomenon of agriculture <br> for consumption, in which another specific way of denying the grain of barley arises that makes it impossible to <br> denial of denial. In this case the process of barley seed advances the statement of the unit of <br> contrary to the grain until the denial of this unit through the germination of the plant; However, the unit of <br> contrary to the plant advances from the affirmation of this unit to its (unnatural) denial in the form of its <br> crushing. The affirmation and denial of the unity of opposites is a derived and universal form of the law <br> contradiction; the denial of denial, in turn, is only a particular form present in all <br> the forms of movement of matter but that is not able to explain the transformation of all processes and <br> phenomena. This understanding of affirmation and denial, as we will see later, is one of the <br> very important philosophical results of the two -line struggle on the CCP around the Maoist principle that <br> One is divided into two. <br> Engels not only culminates the development of Marxist philosophy in the first stage, but also establishes <br> what were the philosophical problems that next generations of communists should concentrate their <br> Attention in order to cable your resolution. In Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of classical German philosophy, Engels <br> highlights what were the tasks present for revolutionary philosophy: <br> “Now, it is no longer a question of taking the concatenations of things from the head, but to discover them <br> own facts. To the displaced philosophy of nature and history there is no more refuge than the kingdom <br> of pure thinking, in what is still left of this: the theory of laws of the process of <br> knowledge, logic and dialectic. ” (Engels) 46 <br> The theory of laws of the knowledge process was formulated in Marxism by the great Lenin in his work <br> masterful materialism and empirocriticism, which was brilliantly developed by President Mao in <br> About practice and where does the right ideas come from? . In relation to logic and dialectic, Engels, in his work <br> Nature dialectic, gave another important indication of the needs for later <br> Developments: <br> “Therefore, it is in the history of nature and the history of human society that the laws of <br> dialectic. These are only the most general laws of these two phases of historical development, such as <br> of the thought itself. They are reduced, more precisely, especially to three: <br> · The law of transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa; <br> · The Law of the Interpenetration of Opposites; <br> · The Law of Denial of Denial; <br> All three were developed by Hegel to their idealistic way as simple laws of thought: <br> the first in the first part of logic, in the theory of being; the second occupies the entire second part of its <br> Logic, which is by far the most important, the theory of essence; The third, finally, figures as law <br> fundamental for the construction of the whole system. <br> (…) <br> At this point, we do not need to compose a dialectic manual, but only to demonstrate that the laws <br> dialectics are real laws of nature development, that is, they are also valid for the <br> Theoretical scientific research of nature. Therefore, we cannot address here the <br> interconnection of these laws. ” (Engels) 47 <br> Engels clarifies, therefore, that it takes the most general laws of nature, society and the thought of the work <br> Science of Logic, of Hegel. It highlights, their relationship with the Hegelian philosophical system: the law of <br> conversion of quantity into quality as part of the doctrine of being; the law of contradiction as part of the <br><br><br> Doctrine of essence, highlighted by Engels as the most important part of Hegelian logic; and the law of <br> denial of denial as part of the doctrine of the concept and, at the same time, as a fundamental law of the <br> Hegelian system. The most important, however, is that Engels indicates the need to address the <br> interconnection of these laws. <br> The great Lenin, unfortunately, could not know the dialectical work of nature, because it was only published in <br> 1927, in the USSR. However, in their brilliant philosophical notebooks, particularly in their studies on <br> The science of Hegel's logic approached precisely the internal interconnection of these laws. It was up, in turn, to <br> President Mao, departing largely by the striker by Lenin, toast to the international proletariat<br>more advanced formulation of the materialistic dialectic in over the contradiction, giving the <br> exposure of the contradiction law as a unique fundamental law of dialectic and, later, its interconnection <br> internal with their expressions or derived laws: quantity/quality and affirmation/denial. Which is <br> We will seek to address in the next topics. <br> 1.2- Leninism: the law of unity and struggle of contrary as the core of dialectic <br> In the second stage of the ideology of the international proletariat, Lenin will promote an important leap in <br> Theoretical elaboration of the conception of Marxist world, that is, in dialectical materialism. Marxism- <br> Leninism drives the development of Marxist philosophy in its two central problems: the theory of <br> knowledge and dialectic. Regarding the first problem, Lenin establishes in a complete and complete manner <br> The theory of knowledge as an active reflection of matter in consciousness. In relation to dialectics, it will be Lenin <br> Who will formulate, for the first time, that the unity of contrary constitutes "the core of dialectic". <br> One of Lenin's first theoretical works is an important philosophical work, controversial with <br> Russian populists and their attacks against Marxism. Who are the “friends of the people” and how they fight <br> Against social democrats (1894), Lenin makes a great defense of dialectical materialism and, <br> particularly, from the materialistic conception of history developed by Karl Marx and Frederich Engels, <br> still demonstrating very early on its broad theoretical and practical rule of Marxism. <br> His most important philosophical work, materialism and empirocriticism (1909), would be published a few years <br> Later, in a time of ideological crisis among the communists in Russia. In the year 1905, the <br> first democratic revolution in Russia, which mobilized massively workers and peasants, in a <br> great armed insurrection followed by a relatively prolonged civil war until 1907. This first <br> revolutionary attempt was defeated by czarism that, after the reflux of the revolutionary wave, establishes a <br> Broad and violent counterrevolution, the Stolipynian reaction. Many revolutionaries were arrested, outward and <br> exiled, but the greatest impact on Russian social democracy was the ideological, that is, whether it would be possible or not <br> make the democratic revolution to defeat the tsarist autocracy, whether or not the tactics were correct <br> revolutionaries of that period. <br> At that time, Lenin was already the main communist leader in the country heading the Bolshevik fraction <br> Russian Social Democratic Worker Party. In the beginning of 1905, already after the beginning of the surveys <br> armed workers and peasants, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks gathered at separate congresses and <br> They formulated opposite tactics for the Democratic Revolution in Russia. While the mensheviks <br> proposed a directist tactic to put themselves the towing the Russian liberal bourgeoisie, trusting this <br> direction of the bourgeois democratic revolution; Lenin, and the Bolsheviks, in turn, established the powerful <br> tactic that proposed that the proletariat should fight for the direction of that revolution to take it the maximum <br> ahead and the establishment of the worker-pamponian alliance to, based on an armed contingent <br> directed by the proletariat, trigger the insurrection against the tsarist aristocracy and against the bourgeoisie <br> liberal, seeking to direct this revolution by establishing the revolutionary democratic dictatorship <br> workers and peasants. <br> Despite the correction of this political line, the conditions of greater subjective development were lacking while <br> greater organizational capacity of the Bolshevik fraction to perform the revolutionary tasks required in the <br> Conducting and achieving the revolution and its triumph. These subjective conditions would be obtained in the years <br> following for the intake effort of the then Russian Social Democratic Workers Party, reconstituted by <br> Lenin and the Left Bolsheviks in 1912 at the Prague Conference, which assured with the realization <br> of the Democratic Revolution in February, 1917, transform it into the victorious great socialist revolution of <br><br><br> October, of the same year. However, the defeat of the 1905 Democratic Revolution had caused a huge <br> Ideological vacillation in social democratic ranks, including the Bolshevik fraction. These vacillations <br> ideological sought to theoretically justify their capitulation by assuming bourgeois philosophical conceptions, <br> in the name of the last advances of the natural sciences, contest the validity of philosophy <br> Revolutionary of the proletariat, dialectical materialism. <br> Bogdanov, Bazarov, Lunacharski and other militants and Bolshevik leaders came to argue that <br> Empiriocritic philosophy formulated by the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach corresponded to a great advance <br> Philosophical, which represented the overcoming of the opposition between materialism and idealism. The Great Lenin,<br>Following the footsteps of Engels in anti-dühring, it undertake a formidable two-line struggle against these <br> positions, unmasking their philosophical falsifications, their surrender to the bourgeois conception of the world, <br> Thus by able to apply to the Bolshevik fraction this rotten revisionist position. In this way, materialism <br> and Empiriocriticism, it constitutes the decisive ideological work to overcome the misconduct of defeat in 1905 and for <br> if it reaches the victory in 1917 and the great later advances. <br> For this “critical” empiricism, in the process of knowledge, the sensation was taken as primary, but if <br> He maintained that matter did not exist as such, and that the essence of the phenomenon could not be known. O <br> Empiriocriticism mocked philosophical materialism argued that this revolutionary conception <br> He took matter as something "sacred". For empirocriticism, there was no objective matter outside <br> Consciousness, for this idealistic conception physical bodies were “complexes of sensations”. <br> Lenin initially unmasks the philosophical content of empirocriticism showing that in <br> Mach's philosophical foundation there was no “novelty”, but the reprint of the old theory <br> Subjectivist idealist philosophical seventeenth century by Bishop Berkeley. Mach's philosophy established a <br> absolute identity between the sensation and the physical body, thus reduced matter to the sensation that we have <br> and the process of knowledge to the discoveries of the necessary relationships between our own sensations and <br> Not of the material movement that is anterior and, relatively, independent to our consciousness. In turn, the <br> Berkeley's philosophy maintained that things are a “set of ideas”, so it established a <br> indissoluble identity between consciousness and things, thus reduced the process of knowledge to the <br> Discovery of the divine ideas present beforehand in all natural and social phenomena. <br> In opposition to this conception, Lenin will defend the two fundamental principles of philosophical materialism, <br> Systematized by Engels in Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of German classical philosophy: 1st) The matter is anterior <br> consciousness and exists independently of this; 2) Consciousness may reflect the objective essence of all <br> the phenomena. Then, in a new level, the dialectical materialistic theory of <br> Knowledge, that is, the communist conception of the relationship between thinking and being. <br> Firstly, Lenin demonstrates that there is no indissoluble connection between thought and thing, nor <br> between sensation and physical bodies. Demonstrates that matter is prior to human consciousness, reveals that this is <br> a result, a product from the development of inorganic matter to organic matter and consequences <br> of the transformation of life in human society. Matter, therefore, is prior to consciousness and, in turn, the <br> consciousness is a product of the transformation of matter and, thus, matter cannot be a <br> "Complex of sensations" not even a "set of ideas". The matter is, according to the brilliant definition of <br> Lenin: <br> “(…) A philosophical category to designate objective reality, given to man in his sensations, <br> Decald, photographed and reflected by our sensations and existing independent of them. ” (Lenin) 48 <br> Lenin demonstrates precisely the conditional and relative character of the unity of opposites between thought <br> and the being. This unity is not indissoluble, for consciousness is neither prior to matter nor arises <br> immediately with this; the unity between being and thinking is, therefore, a product of the dialectic of nature, <br> as brilliantly defined Engels. Certain conditions are necessary for this unit to emerge and, <br> Without these conditions, there can be no awareness. In turn, the conditions for inert matter <br> transform into organic nature and this organic nature becomes consciousness are created by <br> very movement and transformation of matter. Consciousness does not arise from the nature caused by a <br> external force to nature, but by its own movement and transformation, therefore, Lenin points out that <br> although matter is not a “set of ideas” or a “set of sensations” is “logical to suppose that all <br><br><br> Matter has a property essentially similar to sensation, the property of reflecting. ” And the <br> intrinsic property of inert matter of reflecting, reacting to mechanical, chemical, electric, etc., <br> that is, it is the contradiction inherent in eternal matter that drives its automation in incessant <br> transformation. <br> In this way, Lenin supports the dialectical materialistic conception of the transformation of matter into <br> consciousness, which corresponds to the first fundamental principle of philosophical materialism, or the first <br> form of identity between being and thinking. Following, Lenin addresses the issue of the capacity of<br>Awareness of knowing being, reflecting the essence of objective phenomena outside consciousness. This one <br> It is the second fundamental principle of philosophical materialism, or the second form of identity between being <br> and thinking. The first form of identity corresponds to the passive aspect of reflex theory; the second <br> Form of identity, corresponds to the active aspect of reflex theory. In the first form, the being <br> transforms into consciousness; In the second, consciousness becomes being. Let's see, as Lenin establishes <br> In a new level this issue in developing the Marxist theory of knowledge. <br> Lenin begins the treatment of this question by resuming Engels when he says: <br> “Hegel was the first one who knew how to accurately expose relationships between freedom and necessity. For <br> He, freedom is nothing other than knowledge of necessity. (…) Freedom does not reside in <br> dreamed independence in the face of natural laws, but in the knowledge of these laws and in the possibility, <br> based on said knowledge, to make them act in a regular way for certain purposes. (…) <br> Freedom therefore, in the domain over ourselves and the outer nature, based on the <br> knowledge of natural needs. ” (Engels apud LENIN) 49 <br> Then Lenin, defends and brilliantly develops this Marxist postulate: <br> “The development of the consciousness of each separated human individual and the development of <br> collective knowledge of all humanity show us with each step the transformation of the <br> in itself 'not known in' things for us' known, the transformation of blind need, <br> Known, the 'need' itself, in the 'need for us' known. (…), In the reasoned reasoning <br> Engels, of course, applies to philosophy the method of the 'vital jump', that is, makes a leap from theory to <br> practice. (…) Domain over nature, which manifests itself in the practice of humanity, is a result <br> of the faithful objective reflex of the phenomena and processes of nature in the brain of man and constitutes the <br> proof that said reflex (within the limits of what the practice shows us) is an objective truth, <br> absolute, eternal. ” (Lenin) 50 <br> In this formulation, Lenin makes an important leap in Marxist philosophy, by establishing that knowledge <br> corresponds to the transformation of necessity, that the process of knowledge needs a leap of the <br> theory to practice and, moreover, that practice constitutes the criterion of objective truth of a particular <br> Subjective reflection in the consciousness of reality. <br> Masterfully Lenin solves the problem of identity between thought and being, advancing thus <br> Much in the theoretical formulation of the Marxist conception on the issue. Thus presents the necessary relationship <br> Between thought and being, of thought as a product of the development of matter; lays down <br> thus its first form of relative unit. Shows that thinking is a relevant of social practice, <br> even though social consciousness is a reflection of the social being. By showing, that freedom is the <br> knowledge of necessity, and that such knowledge is the transformation of this need, that this <br> transformation occurs through the leap from theory to practice, Lenin presents in a form greater than the second <br> form of identity between thought and being, or between knowing and doing. And, it also shows the character <br> relative of this unity between thought and being, this correspondence between the subjective and the objective, to the <br> solve the problem of the relationship between the relative character and the absolute character of the truth: <br> “From the point of view of modern materialism, that is, of Marxism, they are historically conditional <br> the limits of the approximation of our knowledge to the objective, absolute truth, but the existence <br> Of this truth, as well as the fact that we approach it does not obey conditions. They are <br> historically conditional the contours of the picture, but it is unconditional that this picture represents <br> an objectively existing model. It is historically conditional when and under what circumstances <br> we progress our knowledge of the essence of things (…), but unconditionally each of these <br> Discoveries is a progress of 'unconditionally objective knowledge'. ” (Lenin) 51 <br><br><br> Each discovery constitutes the identity between the subjective and the objective, as every unit of contrary is <br> Relative, this truth achieved will also have a relative, conditional character. However, the set <br> Faithful of relative truths constitutes the unconditional, absolute truth of the universe. The process of <br> knowledge, therefore, is the infinite movement of approximating consciousness to this objective truth and <br> Absolute. This Leninist formulation represented an important leap in the Marxist theory of knowledge. <br> The great Lenin in refuting idealistic positions on the theory of knowledge, whether the empiricists <br> of Mach, be the subjective idealists like Berkeley's, hardly attacked the idealistic background of these<br>positions that apply to the existence of a divine consciousness prior to nature, sometimes the existence of <br> an “indissoluble connection of the environment and the self”, as is the case with Fichte's idealistic philosophy and the use that <br> Bogdanov did this. As already seen above, Lenin showed the relative character of this unit and the condition <br> necessary of matter as prior to consciousness. However, by correctly criticizing the unit <br> indissoluble between matter and consciousness, Lenin took the term “identity” as equal to the concept of <br> “Indissoluble connection” and thus presented the following formulation: <br> “Social being and social consciousness are not identical, just as they are not the being in general <br> and consciousness in general. Of the fact that men, when they relate, do so as beings <br> Conscious, in no way derives that social consciousness is identical to social being. (…) A <br> Social conscience reflects the social being: so it is as Marx teaches us. The reflection can be a copy <br> About exactly what is reflected, but it is absurd to talk here in identity. (…) that <br> theory of the identity of social being and social consciousness is, from beginning to end, an absurd, a <br> Unquestionably reactionary theory. ” (Lenin) 52 <br> It is evident that Lenin speaking of the non -identity between social being and social consciousness is not denying <br> that one aspect becomes the other, under certain conditions. So much so that “consciousness <br> social reflects the social being ”. In this passage, Lenin is fighting the philosophical falsification of Bogadov <br> which established an absolute identity between social being and social conscience. Starting from the false assumption <br> that being social = social conscience, Bogdanov concluded that it was enough to study social conscience to <br> deduce from this the characteristics of the social being. In addition to being idealistic, this revisionist conception is metaphysical, because <br> It takes two contradictory aspects, in case it is social and social conscience, as if they were one and the same <br> thing. Absolute and non -relative identity of the opposite aspects of a contradiction is one of the <br> metaphysical to integrate two into one. <br> Lenin, therefore, is defending the materialistic conception of Marx's history, which establishes that men <br> They enter certain social relations without initially aware of these same relationships. <br> The social awareness of these relationships is a product of the dialectical development of social practice and <br> Social conscience, and therefore, cannot be immediately given. As established by Lenin, only in <br> certain conditions there is this identity, which is not absolute but relative; the approximate reflection of the <br> subjective in the face of the objective. <br> This passage of materialism and empiriciticism was later used by the revisionist philosophers <br> In China, Liu Shao-Chi epigons as a way to combat Maoism. We will see this question in detail, <br> further up. Here, it is only up to us to emphasize the following: in the passage of Lenin, mentioned above, there is no <br> no error of philosophical conception, but there is an inaccuracy in the formulation of the issue, in the management of <br> Dialectical concept “identity”, which encompasses the difference and equality at the same time. It will be your own <br> Lenin who will solve, in philosophical notebooks, this conceptual issue, but here it is important to see that <br> as well as in the class struggle, not every defeat corresponds to a mistake of political line or conception <br> philosophical; also in the theoretical struggle not every inaccurate or insufficient formulation corresponds to a <br> manifestation of idealism or metaphysics. Philosophy corresponds to the theoretical formulation of the conception of <br> world of a particular class; This formulation is also a process in which it approaches <br> more accurate and more accurate ways. This is what occurs in the present case. The importance of emphasizing it is <br> to highlight the importance of Lenin's struggle against the absolute identity of aspects in a contradiction. <br> For as we will see, there are two ways to integrate two into one; Prachanda does so through conciliation <br> of the contradictory aspects and Avakian does so through the absolute identity between the opposites. Both <br> correspond to revisionist perspectives of Marxist philosophy, because in the end, both suppress the <br> Contrary struggle. <br><br><br> In relation to the other major problem for Marxist philosophy, pointed out by Engels, the dialectic, the great <br> leap given by Lenin on this ground is condensed in the aforementioned philosophical notebooks (1914-1915), who <br> were published in the USSR in the years 1929 and 1930. In this vast material, two manuscripts are more <br> Important: The summary of the book of Hegel “Science of Logic” (1914) and on the issue of dialectic <br> (1915). The first is a notebook of Lenin notes from his studies of the book Science of Logic <br> of Hegel; The second is a systematization of Lenin's conclusions about materialistic dialectic. In this <br> Material is contained a series of great Leninist philosophical formulations about dialectic and some<br>Essential bumps in your reflection theory. <br> In relation to the conception of the dialectical materialistic world formulates that: <br> “(…) Internal contradictions lead to the replacement of old content with a new, <br> higher." (Lenin) 53 <br> This formulation is that, as it is of general knowledge, would be developed later brilliantly <br> by President Mao. Regarding the concept “identity”, Lenin fully completes his understanding <br> about it, formulating precisely that: <br> “Dialectics is the doctrine of how the opposites can be and are (how they become) identical - in <br> what conditions they are identical, becoming each other - because the reason for man <br> should not take these contrary by the dead, rigid, but by alive, conditioned, furniture, <br> turning each other. ” (Lenin) 54 <br> In this and other passages the development of Lenin's philosophical thinking in the <br> your own work. As well as Marx and Engels, they advanced from the denial of denial to contradiction in the <br> Explanation of the suppression of private property, Lenin advances the non -absolute identity between consciousness <br> social and social being for the understanding that the opposites are and become identical in certain <br> conditions. The conception is the same, but the formulation has made a significant leap. The advance in understanding <br> dialectic allows Lenin to formulate in an even more developed and clear form the Marxist theory of the <br> knowledge, particularly as to the problem of identity between thinking and being: <br> “The abstraction of matter, the law of nature, the abstraction of value, etc., in a word, all <br> scientific abstractions (correct, serious, non -absurd) reflect the nature more deeply, more <br> faithfully, more completely. From living intuition to abstract thinking and from it to practice - such is the <br> dialectical path of knowledge of truth, knowledge of objective reality. ” <br> (Lenin) 55 <br> Here Lenin completely presents the two jumps of the knowledge process, fully <br> later developed by President Mao in about the practice. Regarding the question of <br> Transformation of the subjective into objective, Lenin points out that: <br> “Man's consciousness not only reflects the objective world but creates it. That is, the world does not <br> satisfies man and man decides to modify him with his action. ” (Lenin) 56 <br> About practice as a main aspect in the process of knowledge development, Lenin formula <br> what: <br> “Practice is superior to knowledge (theoretical), because it has not only the dignity of universality <br> but also of immediate reality. ” (Lenin) 57 <br> AND: <br> “The result of the action is the proof of subjective knowledge and the criterion of objectivity <br> truly existing. ” (Lenin) 58 <br> In relation to the Leninist leap in the formulation of dialectics, in Marxist philosophy, it appears in the summary of the <br> Hegel's book “Science of Logic”, the immortalized and fully developed passage, on the <br> contradiction: <br><br><br> “Briefly, dialectic can be defined as the doctrine of the unity of the opposites. With this <br> The core of dialectics will be embedded, but this requires clarification and development. ” (Lenin) 59 <br> In the manuscript on the issue of dialectic (1915), Lenin advances even more in the establishment of the Law of <br> Contradiction as a unique fundamental law of materialistic dialectic. Sitting the foundations for the principle <br> Revolutionary that everything in the universe is one divided into two, Lenin establishes that: <br> "The bipartition of the Uno and the knowledge of its contradictory parts is the essence of dialectic." <br> (Lenin) 60 <br> Developing the formulation of the contrary unit as the core of dialectic, Lenin states that: <br> “The identity of the opposites (…) is the recognition (the discovery) of contradictory trends, <br> mutually excluding, opposite in all phenomena and processes of nature (including also <br> the spirit and society). The condition of knowledge of all processes in the world in its <br> ‘Automation’, in its spontaneous development, in its living life, is their knowledge <br> as a unit of opposites. Development is 'struggle' of opposites. ” (Lenin) 61 <br> Lenin, following the footsteps of Engels, brilliantly establishes the relationship between objective dialectic and <br> subjective dialectic. All processes of nature advance as identity and struggle of opposites, therefore, the <br> The condition for the knowledge of these process is to take them as a unit of contrary. Lenin Embraded of <br> Classical way The conception of dialectical materialistic world, in its widely known formulation: <br> “The two fundamental (…) conceptions of development (evolution) are: development as <br> decrease and increase, such as repetition, and development as a unit of opposites ( <br> one in mutually exclusive opposites and reciprocal relationship between them). ” (Lenin) 62 <br> In one passage the law of contradiction is synthesized and the principle that one is divided into two. Moreover,<br>Lenin establishes the proletarian revolutionary principle of Marxist dialectic: <br> “Unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of the opposites is conditional, temporary, <br> Transient, relative. The struggle of the mutually exclusionary opposites is absolute, as absolute is the <br> development, the movement. ” (Lenin) 63 <br> There is no doubt about the gigantic role of the great Lenin in these two great works materialism and <br> Empiriocriticism and in philosophical notebooks, to establish the law of contradiction as law <br> unique fundamental of dialectic. Therefore, it constitutes a total contrast, which does the UOC (mlm) to insist <br> which is the law of denial of negation to which "best explains the direction of the movement." This is not only <br> in opposition evident to Maoism, but also, as it should be, to Marxism and the <br> Leninism. <br> Finally, it is necessary to dedicate a few words about the role of the great comrade Stalin in the <br> Development of Marxist philosophy. Stalin was Lenin's continuator and assumed with high wingspan <br> difficult task of continuing socialist construction, after its premature death in 1924. Following <br> He directed with great mastery the complex struggle of two lines against Trotskism and, then, against the <br> Bukharinism. In the fight against the revisionist line of Bukharin, which opposed the conclusion of Nep (new <br> Economic policy) and socialist collectivization, Stalin faced a more structured restorationist line <br> than the position openly counterrevolutionary and betraying Trotsky. Bukharin, a faithful follower of <br> Trotskyist current, he came to argue that the socialist economic base should combine by a long <br> Capitalist and socialist elements period. To support your position, it had the formulations <br> Philosophical from the Deberin School, a revisionist philosopher who defended the theory of contradiction reconciliation. <br> According to Deerin, in the course of a given process contradictions only arise from a given <br> moment, before only differences would remain, but not contradictions. That is, for this, difference is not <br> contradiction. <br> Stalin managed to apologize for Bukharin's restoration line in time to prepare the USSR for the big <br> clash that was announced in the world, with the rise of Nazifascism in Italy, Germany and Japan. <br> also the Deberin School unfurling with vigorously the flag of the opposition to the opposition to rotten <br><br><br> Theory of the conciliation of contradictions. The theoretical formulation of the Stalin comrade that condenses the <br> Fundamentals of the proletarian line to apologize the revisionist line is contained in the work materialism <br> Dialectical history and materialism, which constitutes a chapter of the very important work of the <br> PC History (B) USSR (1937). However, in this chapter two important errors of <br> Unilateralism of comrade Stalin in the fighting to the positions of Bukharin and Deberin. In the fight around <br> field collectivization, Stalin too much emphasizes the importance of productive forces in relation to the <br> Revolution of production relations. This was a difficult mistake to avoid, because it was <br> simply from the first experience of socialist construction. However, when dealing with the “fundamental traits <br> of the Marxist Dialectical Method ”64, the comrade Stalin makes important mistakes by exposing the dialectic <br> materialistic. These were errors that could be avoided, because they were questions already advanced by <br> Lenin in the philosophical notebooks. Therefore, the exposure of dialectic, by Stalin, in this work is a <br> setback. <br> It is decisive to emphasize that despite the errors, the exposure of the Marxist philosophical conception was mainly <br> correct and the errors constituted the secondary aspect, but needed to be overcome by the development <br> posterior of ideology. The Stalin comrade formula as four fundamental characteristics of dialectic <br> Marxist: 1) Everything is linked; 2) Everything transforms; 3) the transformation of quantity into quality; and 4) <br> the fight of the opposites. Stalin rightly establishes that: <br> “If the world is in incessant movement and development and if the law of development <br> It is the extinction of the old and the strengthening of the new, it is evident that there can be no regime <br> unalterable social, nor can there be 'eternal principles' of private property and exploitation, <br> nor the 'eternal ideas' of the submission of peasants to landlords and workers to <br> capitalists. ” (Stalin) 65 <br> As President Mao emphasizes the replacement of the old by the new is a “general and imprescriptible law of the <br> Universe ”and therefore a central question in the conception of the world of Marxist philosophy. Another aspect <br> very important highlighted by Stalin, in this text, is that a phenomenon can only be resolved by <br> their internal contradictions and through the struggle between the opposites. In this way the character correctly accentuates<br>Absolute of the struggle of the opposites, highlighted by Lenin and later developed by President Mao: <br> “If the development process is a process of revealing internal contradictions, a <br> shock process between opposed forces on the basis of these contradictions and with the end of <br> it is evident that the class struggle of the proletariat is a perfectly natural and <br> inevitable. This means that what should be done is not to conceal the contradictions of the regime <br> capitalist, if not to take them cable to the end. This means that in politics, so as not to misunderstand, <br> there must be a proletarian, class, uncompromising, and not a reformist policy of <br> harmony between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, an opportunistic policy of 'gradual integration' <br> capitalism in socialism. ” (Stalin) 66 <br> With this formulation, the comrade Stalin sought to apologize the revisionist line of Bukharin and theorizing <br> Philosophical of Deerin and his defense of the conciliation of contradictions. <br> However, comrade Stalin ends up unilaterally emphasizing the struggle of the opposites, treating it <br> dissociated way of the unity of the opposites. And it treats incompletely on the identity of the opposites, <br> in its most important content: the mutual transformation of opposites and how the conditions are created for <br> This transformation. In dealing with what lists as the first fundamental feature of the dialectical method, <br> Stalin deals with mutual dependence between phenomena, “indissoluble connection with phenomena <br> surrounding and conditioned by them ”67. Thus addresses one aspect of the unity of the opposites, the <br> their interdependence, but err by treating it dissociated from the struggle, because what connects the <br> different phenomena, as well as the opposite aspects in a contradiction, is not an indissoluble connection, <br> but the absolute struggle and the relative unity between the opposites. <br> On the other hand, when it addresses what it classifies as the fourth characteristic of the dialectical method, the struggle of <br> against, Stalin does so separately from the unity of the opposites, and does not analyze the transformation of <br> phenomena from the struggle and identity of the opposites, not unveiling that the qualitative leap in <br> a process constitutes the mutual transformation between the new and old aspect in the contradiction, with the new <br><br><br> assuming the main, dominant condition and the old man passing the secondary, dominated condition. Thus, the <br> comrade formulates the quality jump as follows: <br> “(…) The development process of the lower to the upper does not travel a path of <br> harmonic development of phenomena, but always putting on relief the contradictions <br> inherent in objects and phenomena, in a process of 'struggle' between the opposed trends <br> that act on the basis of those contradictions. ” (Stalin) 68 <br> As Lenin had already pointed out, the process of developing a phenomenon is a process of unity <br> and struggle between the opposites, and that through the absolute struggle of the opposites under certain conditions each <br> contrary it becomes its opposite and this constitutes the most important aspect of the identity of the opposites. <br> Not sufficiently understanding the relationship between unity and struggle of the opposites and, particularly, this <br> aspect of the identity of the opposites, constituted the errors of metaphysical conception that sometimes incurred the <br> Comrade Stalin, errors criticized and rectified by President Mao. This conception error is related to <br> other Stalin errors, such as not considering the identity of opposing contradictions between forces <br> Productive and Production Relations, between economic base and superstructure. That is, although the productive forces <br> and the economic basis is ultimately the dominant aspect of production and <br> superstructure, under certain conditions of the development of the social process, relations of production and <br> superstructure become the main aspect of contradiction. <br> However, it should be noted that an important part of these errors were corrected by the comrade himself <br> Stalin in the course of the development process of his direction. For example, in economic problems of the <br> Socialism in the USSR (1952), Stalin rectifies his vision on the weight of the development of productive forces <br> for the construction of socialism and concentrates its attention on the problem of the development of <br> production. However, in this work appears the other error of the underestimation of the importance of revolution <br> superstructure to fully complete the revolution of production relations in society <br> socialist. In a previous work, Marxism and Linguistics Problems (1950), however, Stalin had <br> correctly established that: <br> “The superstructure is created by the base precisely to serve it, to actively help it to <br> take shape and to sharpen, so that it actively fights the destruction of the old base, lame, and <br> your old superstructure. ” (Stalin) 69<br>Here Stalin correctly deals with the conditions in which the superstructure assumes the main aspect in <br> contradiction, of its active role in the destruction of the old economic base of society as a condition for the <br> flowering and development of new production relationships. This demonstrates how the conception of <br> world of comrade Stalin was fundamentally correct, and at the same time, how errors in <br> Theoretical formulation about this conception disrupts ideological development. <br> Contrary to what UOC (MLM) states, Stalin's philosophical error is not that he has "cut" <br> denial of the denial of the fundamental laws of dialectic. The issue is in management and development <br> of the law of contradiction, in advance from the established by Lenin in his work Philosophical notebooks. O <br> problem is not in the denial of denial, but in the lack of understanding of the advances of Lenin and the <br> recognition of the great philosophical leap given by President Mao, in 1937, with the practice and on <br> The contradiction. <br> 1.3- The law of contradiction and its scientific-popular expression in the principle that “one is divided into two” <br> The leap in Marxist philosophy given by President Mao, in turn, does not arise from the correction of errors <br> from Stalin. The development of Marxist dialectic and the Marxist theory of knowledge, achieved soon <br> after the epic long march, it emerges as a necessary leap to Marxism-Leninism for development <br> of the military line and the line of the Democratic Revolution in China. Without this jump in dialectics it would not be possible <br> establishment of the method of struggle of two lines in the treatment of internal contradictions in the party <br> Communist, from the theory of prolonged popular war, of the three fundamental instruments of the revolution - <br> party, popular army and single revolutionary front - and the six laws for the new revolution <br> Democracy. The struggle for solving the concrete problems of the Chinese revolution occurs in the midst of <br><br><br> important struggles of two lines, thus assumed and applied by the direction of President Mao, against the <br> right and “left” and dogmatic opportunistic positions on the CCP and are therefore the origin of the <br> Great leap in Marxist philosophy achieved by President Mao Tsetung. <br> Maoism, as a whole, begins its development as the third stage of the development of the <br> Proletariat ideology by solving the problem of proletarian revolution in colonial/semicolonial countries. <br> This development, in turn, begins by applying the concrete reality of the Chinese revolution <br> of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, especially the contributions of Stalin's thinking, among <br> These are the definition of Leninism, the main contribution to the ideology of the international proletariat. Stands out <br> also among Stalin's contributions the fair and correct international line of the single antifascist front in the course <br> of imperialist World War II. It was applying these universal contributions to the Chinese revolution that the <br> President Mao forged the theory of the Revolution of New Democracy and the theory of the three instruments of <br> Revolution. <br> Development brought by Maoism with the precise formulation of the Marxist political economy of <br> socialist construction and the resolution of the problem of continuity of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, <br> that is, the great proletarian cultural revolution, necessarily implied the correction of philosophical errors <br> From the comrade Stalin. This was a pressing need for the development of ideology, but not <br> constituted the reason for its development, as pointed out by the capitulating balances and revisionists of the <br> Avakianism and Prachandism. <br> The works on practice and contradiction were written after a great setback in the Chinese revolution. A <br> Fifth Grande Campaign of Siege and Annihilation Personally directed by Chiang Kai-Shek against <br> revolutionary support bases, especially against the most consolidated located in the mountains <br> Tchincan, who implied a significant defeat for the revolution, especially for the contingents of the <br> Red Army directed by the CCP. On October 16, 1934, the Red Army, on the <br> Siege and begins the strategic removal that would turn into the long march of 12,500 km. The main cause <br> From this defeat was the subjective, the predominance of Wang Ming's opportunistic “left” adventurer line <br> to “attack in all directions” and seek to quickly conquer large cities; And then, after breaking the <br> Kuomintang siege, the "escape" line aimlessly. This opportunistic line resulted in losses of many <br> Living forces of the revolution and all the territory released by agrarian revolutionary war. However, the <br> President Mao, knowing that a defeat of the proletarian revolution can only be temporary, persisted in the struggle of <br> two lines on the CCP and first appealed the Wang Ming Military Line and, soon its line to the<br>Democratic Revolution in China. Thus, it was established, in 1935, that the growing expansion of the invasion <br> Japanese from the interior of China, which began in 1931 from the Manchuria, corresponded to the modification of <br> main contradiction in the Chinese Revolution and, in this way, the long march is directed to the north of the <br> China, defeating the capitulatory and escape line of Chang Kuo-Tao. The support base of the <br> Shensi, in Yenan, to place himself in the first lines of resistance against the Japanese offensive and <br> transforming Yenan into the great overall rear of the revolution and the anti -japanese National War. <br> These philosophical works, among others, prepared by President Mao immediately represented the <br> ideological consolidation of the left line on the CCP, something similar to what represented materialism and <br> Empiriocriticism in the Bolshevik Party. The philosophical principles presented by him, in the middle of <br> 1937, however, were already present in their form applied in military theory, in the very important work <br> Strategic problems of revolutionary war in China, which was prepared in December 1936. <br> Study of the Laws of the Revolutionary War of China, President Mao establishes the cardinal principles of the law <br> contradiction: <br> 1) Highlights that war is the highest way to resolve antagonistic social contradictions: <br> “War, which has existed since the appearance of private property and classes, is the highest form <br> the struggle to resolve contradictions between classes, nations, states or political groups, when <br> These contradictions came to a certain stage of their development. ” (President Mao) 70 <br> 2) It points out that there are only two types of war and one way to eliminate war: <br> “War, this monster of killing among men, will finally be eliminated by the progress of <br> human society, and will be in the non -distant future. But there is only one way to eliminate it: to oppose <br><br><br> war of war, oppose the revolutionary war to the counterrevolutionary war, to oppose war <br> national to the national counterrevolutionary war and to oppose the revolutionary war from the war <br> Counterrevolutionary Class. History only knows two types of wars: the righteous and the unfair. <br> All counterrevolutionary wars are unfair; all revolutionary wars are <br> fair. ” (President Mao) 71 <br> 3) Analyzes all military problems from unity and struggle between two contrary aspects: <br> “Take into account the distinction as well as the connection between losses and their replacement, the <br> combat and rest, concentration and dispersal of forces, attack and defense, the main attack <br> and the secondary attacks, the centralization and decentralization of command, the prolonged war and the <br> rapid decision war, the war of position and the war of movement, (…) between civil war and <br> national war, between one historical stage and another, etc. ” (President Mao) 72 <br> 4) Establishes the question of fundamental contradiction in the course of the development of the war process: <br> “These are the two aspects of revolutionary war in China, aspects that exist <br> At the same time, that is, with favorable conditions there are difficulties. This is the law <br> fundamental of the revolutionary war of China, from which many other laws derive. ” (President <br> MAO) 73 <br> 5) Establishes the two basic forms of combat and their necessary interchalation in the revolutionary war in <br> China: <br> “There are only two basic forms of combat: offensive and defensive. The enemy suffers a defeat <br> strategic when we devastate your campaign of 'siege and annihilation', our defensive <br> converts to an offensive and he, in turn, goes to the defensive and has to reorganize his forces before <br> launch another campaign. ” (President Mao) 74 <br> 6) Emphasizes the need to create the conditions to reverse the contradictory aspects in war: <br> “The purpose of strategic withdrawal is to conserve the war potential and prepare the counteractive. <br> In the past many people opposed withdrawal to withdrawal, considering it as a 'line <br> opportunistic, purely defensive. ' Our history demonstrated that its opposition was completely <br> erroneous. In preparing a counteractive, we must elect and create certain favorable conditions for <br> we and unfavorable to the enemy in order to achieve a change in the correlation of forces before <br> enter the counterofessive phase. ” (President Mao) 75 <br> 7) It accentuates that only the fight can be operated by the struggle and to in reverse the <br> contradictory aspects in war: <br> “The existence of conditions and a favorable situation for us and unfavorable for the enemy not <br> It means its defeat. These conditions and this situation convert to possibility and not to <br> reality, our victory and the enemy's defeat. In order to produce victory or defeat, it is <br> a decisive battle is necessary between the two armies. Only this battle can solve the problem<br>whose winner is and who is the loser. ” (President Mao) 76 <br> 8) emphasizes that in mutual transformation, identity, contradictory aspects, there is <br> difference and struggle of the opposites: <br> “This is an offensive counterofenfensive or offensive, the principles for solving these problems are <br> in essence the same. In this sense we can say that a counteractive is an offensive. At the <br> However, a countereight is not exactly an offensive. The principles of the countereofensive <br> apply when the enemy is in the offensive, and the principles of the offensive, when the enemy is in <br> defensive. In this sense, there are certain differences between counterfensive and offensive. ” (President <br> Mao) 77 <br> Synthetically, President Mao's military line states that the fundamental contradiction of war <br> revolutionary in China has aspects contrary to favorable conditions (a vast semicolonial country and <br> a fair war directed by the Communist Party) versus unfavorable (faces a powerful enemy with <br><br><br> a small and weak army). The only way to solve this contradiction is through a war <br> prolonged revolutionary. In the face of the enemy's offensive, his siege and annihilation campaigns, the <br> Revolutionary forces oppose an active defense, as part of the siege and annihilation counteramblane. O <br> Objective of the defensive phase in the campaign is to create the conditions to pass on to counterfensive; This is only <br> possible when it comes to creating the conditions to stop a decisive battle that allows to reverse <br> temporarily the correlation of forces and imposing a tactical offensive against an enemy that is <br> Strategically superior. The succession of tactical offensive in the prolonged popular war, in the course of <br> its three strategic steps (defensive, balance and offensive), allows to change the correlation of forces in its <br> Set to thus achieve the enemy's annihilation and gain power across the country. <br> In over the contradiction, President Mao develops this brilliant dialectic in his <br> military thinking already applied successfully in the first four siege and annihilation campaigns of the <br> Kuomintang against revolutionary support bases in southern China (1930-1933) and during the long epic <br> March (1934-1936). About the contradiction generalizes and develops this dialectic, arming the proletariat <br> Chinese and international of an almighty philosophy established in a deeply scientific way and, to the <br> Even time, genuinely popular. <br> Your work by establishing that there are only two world conceptions regarding the development of a <br> thing and phenomenon: the dialectical conception that things develop as a <br> “Automation, internal and necessary” through quantitative and qualitative changes; and conception <br> Metaphysics according to which movement is due to external causes and changes are only quantitative. <br> It establishes that the “universality of contradiction or absolute character of contradiction” has two aspects: <br> 1) contradiction exists in the process of all things and phenomena; It is <br> 2) That the contradiction runs through the whole process from the beginning to the end. <br> President Mao, in turn, by studying the “particularity or relative character of contradiction”, analyzes it <br> in five plans demonstrating: <br> 1) that each form of movement of matter has its particular contradictions; <br> 2) That in the case of movement of matter, each of its processes has a contradiction <br> particular, or fundamental, which distinguishes it from other processes in this form of movement; <br> 3) that this contradiction is composed of two particular opposite aspects; <br> 4) that the development of a process is divided into steps, and each step also has a <br> particular contradiction; <br> 5) that the particular contradiction of a process of a process also has two contrary aspects <br> private. <br> President Mao concludes the study of the particularity of the contradiction, showing the dialectical relationship between the <br> universality and particularity in the study of all things and phenomena: <br> “The particular and the universal are united, and not only the particularity but also the <br> universality of contradiction are inherent in every thing: universality lies in <br> particularity; So when studying something certain, we should try to discover these two <br> sides and their interconnections, the particular and the universal and their interconnection, and to discover the <br> Interconnections between said thing and the numerous things outside her. ” (President Mao) 78 <br> In addition, of the 5 plans referred to in the study of the particularity of the contradiction, President Mao analyzes two <br> Other questions in particular: <br> 1) the main contradiction; It is <br> 2) The main aspect of the contradiction. <br> Highlights that every complex process is composed of numerous contradictions, but that of these only <br> One will be the main contradiction, in a given stage or phase of development of this process. Moreover,<br>formulates that the solution of the main contradiction determines and conditions the resolution of contradictions <br> secondary; and that the study of the main aspect of the main contradiction in a given phenomenon is <br> decisive to gain the resolution of its contradictions. <br><br><br> After the study of universality, the particularity of contradiction and the dialectical relationship between them, the <br> President Mao advances to the study of identity and the struggle between the aspects of contradiction. Lays down <br> so that identity has two senses: <br> 1) The existence of an aspect presupposes the existence of its opposite; It is <br> 2) Under certain conditions, each aspect becomes its opposite. <br> More <br> phenomena, as well as your direction. As for the relationship between the identity and the struggle of the opposites, the President <br> Mao, starting from the established by Lenin, formula that: <br> “Every process has a beginning and end, every process becomes its opposite. The permanence of <br> every process is relative, while its mutability manifests in the transformation of a <br> process in another, it is absolute. ” (President Mao) 79 <br> Then establishes the relationship between the identity and struggle of the opposites, with the previously called <br> Quality quantity conversion law: <br> “In all things are two stages of movement: relative rest and the <br> Change manifests. Both have its origin in the struggle between two contradictory elements contained <br> in each thing. In the first stage of movement, the thing only experiences the changes <br> quantitative and not qualitative changes and, therefore, seems to be at rest. The thing goes on to <br> according to the movement stage when the quantitative changes produced in the first stage <br> They already reach their culminating point, giving rise to the dissolution of the thing as a unique whole, that is, <br> a qualitative change; In this way the stage of change of change appears. The unit, the <br> cohesion, unity, harmony, balance, impasse, dead point, rest, permanence, <br> uniformity, agglutination, attraction, etc., which we see in daily life, are all manifestations of <br> quantitative change stage of things. In the opposite, the dissolution of the single whole, that is, the <br> destruction of this cohesion, union, harmony, balance, impasse, dead point, rest, permanence, <br> uniformity, agglutination, attraction, and their transformation into their respective contrary, are all <br> manifestations of the qualitative stage of change of things, that is, the transformation of a process <br> in another. Things change constantly from the first to the second stage; the struggle of <br> Contrary exists in both internships, and contradiction is resolved through the second stage. It is for <br> This is what the unity of the opposites is conditional, temporary and relative, while the struggle of <br> contrary, mutually exclusive, is absolute. ” (President Mao) 80 <br> This passage is very significant in the process of establishing the law of contradiction as law <br> unique fundamental of dialectic, because for the first in the development of Marxist philosophy the conversion of <br> quantity in quality is based on the unity and struggle of the opposites, that is, through the law of <br> contradiction. President Mao divides the movement of all things and phenomena into two stages: <br> relative rest and manifest change; establishes that the movement in these two stages has its origin in the <br> struggle of the opposite aspects. That in the first stage there are quantitative changes that create the <br> Conditions for manifest change, the jump of quality. In the first stage, harmony, balance <br> Contradictory aspects are manifestations of the quantitative change stage; in the second stage, the <br> contradictory unity dissolves and an aspect or process becomes its opposite. Emphasizes, <br> As soon as the fighting of the opposites happens in both stages, but that contradiction is only resolved in the second <br> Internship, the one of the change manifests. Thus underlies Lenin's definition of being the unity of the opposites <br> relative and the struggle between the absolute opposites. <br> In the work on the practice, which due to space we cannot deal with in this document, <br> a few months before the contradiction appears and constitutes the application of the law of contradiction, in its <br> more elaborate form, to the process of knowledge. In this way, it also constitutes a philosophical leap <br> In this key issue of dialectical materialism. In this work President Mao analyzes social practice and the <br> knowledge as a unity of contrary, the truth is the result of unity and struggle between these two <br> Contrary aspects, but mainly of the struggle between them. Through social practice, the brain <br> Human reflects objective reality, and returns to this same reality that confirms or refutes these reflexes.<br>Social practice and reflex in the conscience of this practice, constitute the contradictory aspects that originate the <br> Movement of human thought. Human knowledge in turn, in its movement towards the <br> True, it also has two stages: 1) sensitive knowledge, and 2) rational knowledge. Through the <br><br><br> first stage, human consciousness collects an immense amount of information that allows to reflect the <br> appearance of things and phenomena. The accumulation of this information, the analysis of this data, creates the <br> conditions for a quality leap: sensitive knowledge becomes rational knowledge, the <br> objective data analysis becomes a synthesis that seeks to reflect the essence of things and <br> phenomena. However, the movement of knowledge does not end in this subjective synthesis, as the <br> Rational conclusions need to be confirmed by social practice. The knowledge process is never <br> Immediate, therefore, the search for truth is the infinite movement of practice to theory and theory to practice. At <br> unity of contrary between social practice and social conscience, social practice constitutes the main aspect, <br> for it constitutes the origin of knowledge and, at the same time, the criterion of truth. Theory is born of practice <br> And only by practice can it be confirmed. In turn, in this contradictory movement an aspect transforms <br> otherwise: practice becomes rational knowledge and rational knowledge, when <br> True, it transforms objective reality through practice. In addition, President Mao highlights, in <br> On contradiction, which under certain conditions consciousness becomes the main aspect of the <br> contradiction. <br> In the final session of the contradiction, President Mao also analyzes the role of antagonism in <br> contradiction as part of the study of the fighting of the opposites. Establishes that although the contradiction resolution <br> can only take place through the struggle of the opposites in turn has two forms of development, which <br> vary according to the character of the contradiction: <br> 1) antagonistic contradictions; It is <br> 2) non-antagonistic contradictions. <br> The struggle of the opposites is absolute, present in all processes, things and phenomena; However, contradiction <br> It is not the same as antagonism, antagonism is a particular form of contradiction and requires method <br> different and corresponding in the resolution of this. When misconceptions, a non- <br> Antagonistic can become an antagonistic contradiction, thus making it difficult to resolve. For another <br> side, a certain contradiction can be antagonistic in a given process and non-antagonistic in a <br> opposite process, as is the case with the contradiction between Campo and City, which is antagonistic in capitalism, but <br> that in socialism must be resolved with non-antagonistic methods. <br> In over the contradiction, President Mao establishes deeply and for the broad masses, <br> extremely complex in philosophy, never before resolved on this level throughout the history of philosophy <br> bourgeois. Clearly advances to the establishment of contradiction as a unique fundamental law of the <br> dialectic, by analyzing it in its various aspects and based on the conversion of quantity to quality <br> in the law of contradiction. For this reason, President Mao concludes this Magna work of Marxist philosophy with the <br> next brilliant synthesis: <br> “The law of contradiction in things, that is, the law of the unity of contrary, is the fundamental law of <br> nature and society and, therefore, also the fundamental law of thought. ” <br> (President Mao) 81 <br> In establishing the law of contradiction as a fundamental law of dialectic, universality and particularity <br> contradiction and, in particular, the two forms of struggle of the opposites (antagonistic and non-antagonic) <br> President Mao shamelessly applauds the conceptions of the Deberin School, also fought by the <br> Comrade Stalin. In this way, the contradiction served as an important contribution from President Mao to the fight <br> of two lines in MCI against Bukharyism and Trotskism, as an important article emphasizes <br> During the great philosophical controversy on the CCP, between 1964 and 1965 (question we will address <br> right ahead): <br> “Deberin distorted the law of the unity of contrary such as the reconciliation, integration or synthesis of <br> contrary. He excluded the struggle from contrary within things. From this theory, he also <br> rejected the existence of class contradiction in Soviet society. In this way, anti-philosophy <br> Deberin's dialectic was used as an ideological weapon by Bukharin- <br> Trotsky. ” (JAO CHING-HUANG) 82 <br> The capitalist pro-restoration positions and against socialist construction in one country of Bukharin and Trotsky, <br> sought in Deberin's philosophy their theoretical foundation. Sought to support their directist line, to maintain <br><br><br> Nep (New Economic Policy) after it essentially met its objectives for reconstruction<br>of the country after the civil war (1918-1922), in the rotten theories of class reconciliation, the integration of <br> contrary and defense of the lack of class struggle in the USSR. Stalin fought this position, but only <br> developments in Marxist philosophy performed by President Mao fully applauded the <br> Philosophical falsification of the Deberin School. <br> Just as in the Bolshevik party, revisionist lines sought to ground theoretically <br> Through the philosophical falsification of dialectical materialism, on the CCP. In this, the same phenomenon occurred <br> after the conquest of power across the country, in 1949. During the fifteen years they travel from 1949 to 1966, the <br> main fight of two lines on the CCP, against the capitalist restoration was against the opportunistic line of <br> right of the renegade and sells workers Liu Shao-Chi. On several occasions, the president's red line <br> Mao had to apologize the restorationist revisionist positions. Through this important struggle of two <br> lines, from the concrete experience of the Socialist Revolution in China (from 1949) and with the beginning of GRCP <br> (culminating in the struggle against the line of Liu Shao-Chi), the thought Mao Tsetung develops and transforms <br> If in Maoism: third, new and superior stage, as would be defined by President Gonzalo, <br> posteriorly. In the course of this two-line struggle (1949-1966), inseparable from the development of the <br> classes in socialist society, there are new and significant advances in the philosophical formulations of the <br> President Mao. <br> This long and decisive fight of two lines on the CCP was around the problems of the main contradiction in the <br> socialist society, from the general line to the transitional period (socialization of industry/commerce, small <br> business and crafts and movement of cooperativeization and collectivization of the field) and the general line for the <br> Socialist construction (which embraced the construction of popular communes and the big leap ahead). AND <br> Importantly, an important part of this two-line struggle against Liu Shao-Chi's right-hand line <br> He gave the fight of two lines in MCI against modern revisionism of Kruschov, whose height occurs <br> Between 1963-64, in the big debate, with which the PCCH under the direction of President Mao's Red Line <br> applauds the Kruscovision positions. <br> The conquest of total power in China marks the opening of President Mao's two lines against Liu <br> Shao-Chi. In March 1949, a few months from the victory, President Mao in the II Plenary Session of the CC of <br> PCCH points out that after the conquest of all power the main contradiction in Chinese society became <br> be the “contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie” 83. In late 1952, President Mao establishes the <br> General line for the transitional period, that is, from the course of the socialist revolution: <br> “(…) To gradually carry out socialist industrialization and gradually perform the transformation <br> socialist of agriculture, capitalist handicraft and trade ”. (President Mao) 84 <br> As opposed to the advancement of the socialist revolution, Liu Shao-Chi formulates the right opportunistic line of <br> “Consolidation of the new democracy system”. This position was applauded by President Mao in 1953, <br> in his speech about the general line of the party for the transitional period: <br> “Some people follow stops in the same place after reaching the triumph of the revolution <br> democratic. Without understanding that the character of the revolution has changed, they continue to work for <br> its new democracy and not by socialist transformations. This will lead them to right -wing errors. ” <br> (President Mao) 85 <br> The application of the general line of the CCP for the transitional period in the field of China made the <br> agricultural cooperation movement driven by the socialist initiative of poor peasants and <br> Midfielder of the lower layer. The reaction of the right to the socialist offensive in the field, was to reformulate the <br> theoretical foundation of its restoration line, the struggle of “consolidation of the new system <br> Democracy ”come to argue that in the period of transition the socialist superstructure would be based on a <br> “Synthesized economic base”, that is, both socialist and capitalist and that the dictatorship of the proletariat <br> should boost and serve both. The theoretical formulation of this opportunistic line was in charge of Liu <br> Shao-Chi to the revisionist philosopher Yang Sien-chun, who wrote the reactionary booklet about the base and the <br> superstructure during the transitional period in the Popular Republic of China. <br> This right offensive initially resulted in reducing the “number of cooperatives” 86. However, the <br> position of the “synthesized economic base” was applauded by the struggle fought by President Mao in 1955, which <br><br><br> with the document on the problem of agricultural cooperativization attacks the essence of that directist position <br> bourgeois: the reissue of the rotten theory of productive forces adapted to the Chinese conditions, which<br>advocated that production relations in the field in China could only advance to socialist relations after <br> the mechanization of the field. As the country's industrial base was very late this would be a process that <br> It would charge a lot of time. President Mao rocks these positions and demonstrates how the relationships of <br> Production could be advanced in relation to productive forces and boosting their development. <br> In this way agricultural cooperativization quickly advanced in China, even with mechanization <br> still precarious and insufficient. This was a great contribution from President Mao to socialist political economy. <br> After this second defeat, Liu Shao-Chi's right-wing line tries to recover breath after the XX <br> Congress of the PCU, which took place in February 1956 and which gives the Word Word of March to the <br> Capitalist restoration in the USSR, with the offensive revisionist of Kruschov and his rotten and liar report <br> Secret. Supported by the revisionist and restorationists of that congress and the temporary defeat of <br> Dictatorship of the proletariat in the USSR, the bourgeois rider of Liu Shao-Chi throws itself in the offensive in <br> VIII CCP Congress, held in October of the same year, and manages to approve the setback in the definition <br> Ideological of the party that removes part of the adopted by the VII Congress, 1945, from “Marxism-Leninism <br> ideas of comrade Mao tsetung ”to“ Marxism-Leninism ”, just at a time when the <br> thought Mao Tsetung advanced stridely to turn into a new, third and superior <br> Step of Marxism. From the point of view, from the general line to the socialist construction, after the defeat of the theory of <br> “Synthesized Economic Base” The right -wing opportunistic line tries to get a new ruse, still approving <br> in the VIII Congress the position that the main contradiction in China was “the one between the system <br> advanced socialist and late social productive forces ”87, thus enjoying, with a new label, the <br> old and revisionist theory of productive forces, arguing that only after the advancement of mechanization <br> could advance socialist relations of production. <br> Despite the setback at the VIII CCP Congress, President Mao's revolutionary proletarian line <br> Initiative and watch new blows against Liu Shao-Chi's right-wing line. Still, in 1958, President Mao <br> wins in the CC establishing the general line for socialist construction: <br> “Put all their strength in tension and fight to march always forward to build socialism <br> according to the standard of quantity, speed, quality and economy. ” (President Mao) 88 <br> With this powerful line, the masses in China, under the direction of the CCCH and under the head of President Mao, <br> they launched themselves boldly in the socialist construction boosting the great leap ahead and the construction of the <br> Popular communes, economic and political units, where the struggle for overcoming the <br> differences between the city and the countryside, between the workers and the peasants, and between manual labor and the <br> intellectual work. In addition, to ensure greater rights to women working people guaranteeing their wide <br> Participation in production, class struggle and scientific experimentation. <br> Difficulties caused mainly by inevitable natural calamities (dry, floods, earthquakes, <br> pests etc.) and others of performance in the application of an audacious plan like this of the big leap ahead, <br> involving hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, intellectual workers, women and <br> youth, in addition to the sabotage of counteraRorevolutionaries, were used by <br> Liu Shao-Chi to attack the thought Mao Tsetung. Again the rightists use the philosopher <br> revisionist Yang Sien-chos to attack the Red Line on the CCCH, which also, in 1958, writes the <br> reactionary article brief exposure on the two categories of “identity”, in which he stated that the defense <br> of the identity between thought and being was an idealistic conception. This document was used to <br> theoretically based, from the falsification of the theory of Marxist-Leninist knowledge, the position <br> Revisionist who criticized President Mao's socialist construction line, as if he were subjectivist. <br> Thus pointed out that the mishaps in the application of the socialist construction plan were products of a <br> idealistic conception of theory of knowledge, of a theory that would be subjectivist, because it believed it was <br> possible to adapt to reality to party plans. <br> These philosophical falsifications of Yang Sien-chos in 1958 were applauding by the president's red line <br> Hand. In this combat, the maoist and proletarian philosopher ai si-chi was highlighted, as stressed by <br> Editor group for revolutionary mass criticism of the party's Higher School, subordinate to the <br> CC of the PCCH, in 1971: <br><br><br> “Our enemies, which are rotten and decaying reactionaries, a handful of stupid blind for their<br>Hunger ambitions, always mistakenly estimate the situation. When they were committed to their <br> Wild counterattack, the proletarian headquarters headed by President Mao marked <br> penetrating that it was necessary to criticize the Yang Sien-chos and company, which <br> time were deliberately tergivating Engels' words to support their own fallacies <br> reactionary. With the proletarian headquarters guide, Ai Si-Chi and other comrades published <br> articles denouncing and criticizing in the theorist and politician the theory of lack of identity between thinking <br> and the being '. ” (Redator Group for Revolutionary Mass Criticism) 89 <br> The ruse of Liu Shao-Chi's revisionist line was to falsify Marxist philosophy to theoretically substantiate <br> His attack on President Mao's line for socialist construction. Cover up with pseudo-marxist phraseology <br> Its rotten bourgeois line of capitalist restoration. This revisionist counterattack once again was <br> applauded by President Mao, who pointed out: <br> “The transitional period is full of contradiction and struggle. Our current revolutionary struggle is still <br> deeper than the revolutionary armed struggles of the past. It is a revolution that will bury <br> forever the capitalist system and other exploration systems. ” (President Mao) 90 <br> The understanding that socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat should be a period of revolution <br> permanent to communism, as unfurled by Marx in criticism of the Gotha program, was <br> acquiring a higher development, sustained in the concrete experience of the struggle for construction <br> socialist and against capitalist restoration. Amid this two-line fight on the CCP, the theory was forged <br> the need for successive proletarian cultural revolutions to reach communism. <br> The struggle of two lines against Liu Shao-Chi, the “Kruschov Chinese”, focused essentially on questions <br> ideological and socialist construction, in the defense of thinking Mao TStung and its general line for the <br> Socialist construction. However, this two-line struggle expressed itself in a special way as “three <br> great struggles in the philosophical front ”from 1949 to 1964: <br> 1st great struggle: against the theory of the “synthesized economic base” (1949-1955) <br> 2nd Great Fight: In defense of the conception of dialectical identity between thought and being (1958-1959) <br> 3rd Great Fight: In defense of the dialectical principle that one is divided into two (1964-1965) <br> All these philosophical struggles were in essence ideological clashes between the president's red line <br> Mao and the revisionist line of Liu Shao-Chi. In all these philosophical struggles, Liu Shao-Chi used his <br> Assacla Yang Sien-chos aimed at creating a theoretical base and a public opinion favorable to his line <br> revisionist. As synthesized the article three great struggle in the philosophical front: <br> “Between 1949 and 1964, three important struggles of principles in the philosophical front of our country were crashed, <br> namely: the struggle around the issue of economic base and superstructure, the struggle around the issue <br> If there is identity between thinking and being, and the struggle around the question that 'one is divided into two' <br> or 'two are part of one'. The three struggles were caused, one after another, by Yang Sien-chun, <br> agent of the renegade, hidden traitor and sells workers Liu Shao-Chi in philosophical circles, in <br> crucial conjunctures of the struggle between the two classes (the proletariat and the bourgeoisie), between the two ways <br> (the socialist and the capitalist) and between the two lines (the Marxist and the revisionist). It was hard <br> battles between dialectical materialism and historical materialism, by one part, and idealism and <br> metaphysics by another. Were a reflection, in the philosophical front of the acute national class struggle and <br> International." (Redator Group for Revolutionary Mass Criticism) 91 <br> These two -line struggles as a reflection of the class struggle in socialist revolution and construction in China, <br> boosted the development of Marxist philosophy. Among the ideological works that mark the advance <br> philosophical of the ideology of the international proletariat in the course of the Socialist Revolution in China, highlight <br> SE: About the problem of agricultural cooperativization (1955), about the correct treatment of contradictions in the <br> People's bosom (1957), dialectical method for internal unity in the party (1957) and where ideas come from <br> correct? (1963). <br> As mentioned earlier, in about the problem of agricultural cooperativization, President Mao does <br> In pieces, in theory and in practice, the rotten and revisionist “theory of productive forces”. In over the <br><br><br> correct treatment of contradictions within the people, President Mao advances the Marxist dialectic in <br> decisive issues for socialist construction, how to treat unity and the struggle of contrary when it is <br> It is necessary to seek the relative balance between the aspects of a contradiction. That is, how to achieve the<br>Balance between: production and consumption, industry and agriculture, centralism and democracy. President Mao <br> demonstrates that this balance can only be achieved through the struggle of the opposites and not by the reconciliation of the <br> contradiction: <br> “What we call balance is the relative and temporary unity of the opposites. After a year, this <br> balance, taken as a whole, is broken by the struggle of the opposite, this unit is altered, <br> balance becomes imbalance, unity in division and then, once again <br> necessary to get balance and unity for the following year. In this lies the superiority of our <br> planned economy. In fact, this balance and this unit partially break each month <br> and every quarter, and require partial adjustments. ” (President Mao) 92 <br> Recognition of contradiction and the proper method of the struggle to solve contradiction, are decisive for <br> progressively advance in socialist construction. In socialist society, not even in communism, if <br> will reach a point where there will be no contradictions. The balance between production and consumption can only be <br> achieved from the recognition of the contradiction between these two opposite aspects, this balance does not <br> will be achieved by the conciliation of the contradiction; After all, the resolution of every contradiction is only possible <br> through the struggle, so the desired balance between these two aspects can only be achieved through the struggle <br> Decided against the imbalance that arises the “month and all quarter”, between these two contradictory aspects. <br> This was an important philosophical development established by President Mao, essential for the <br> Correct formulation of plans for socialist construction, towards the bright communism. <br> In dealing with the particular contradictions of socialist construction, President Mao reaffirms the universal character <br> and absolute of the law of contradiction. Therefore, in 1957, the condition of the law of <br> contradiction as the fundamental law of materialist dialectic: <br> “Marxist philosophy maintains that the law of unity of contrary is the fundamental law of the universe. <br> This law has universal validity, both for nature and human society and for the thought of the <br> man. The opposite sides of a contradiction form a unit and in turn fight with each other, the <br> which produces the movement and the transformation of things. Everywhere there are contradictions, <br> But they have a different character according to the nature of things. In anything concrete, the <br> unity of the opposites is conditional, temporary, transient and, therefore, relative, while the struggle <br> Among the opposites is absolute. ” (President Mao) 93 <br> In recalcating the law of contradiction as the fundamental law of the universe, President Mao also emphasizes that <br> It is the contradiction that produces the movement and transformation of things and phenomena. So it doesn't pass <br> for falsification of the direction of the UOC (MLM) to say Maoist and at the same time argue that it is the denial of <br> denial that best explains the direction of movement and the transformation of things. In this case, the difficulty <br> is not in identifying forgery, but in analyzing the relationship of this forgery with other misrepresentations <br> Ideological and political, a question that we will also deal with. <br> As mentioned earlier, where do the right ideas come from? (1963) constituted a significant <br> development in the Marxist theory of knowledge in that it emphasized the issue of <br> identity between thought and being. This development was also the product of the concrete struggle by <br> Socialist construction and the struggle of two lines against the revisionist Liu Shao-Chi and his scribe Yang Sien-chun. <br> Yang Sien-chen's theoretical foundation came from the philosophical falsification of the Leninist work materialism <br> and empirocriticism. As we saw in the previous session, in this work, Lenin develops the Marxist theory of <br> knowledge by establishing the theory of reflex, defending the contradictory unity between theory and practice, <br> as well as the identity between both aspects, that is, the identity between thought and being. However, <br> Lenin also fought another philosophical falsification revisionist who advocated an absolute identity <br> between social being and social conscience. This was, for example, the position of the Empiriocriticist-Revisionist <br> Bogdanov, who applied Mach theory that linked the absolute identity between sensation and matter to theory <br> of knowledge, presenting this eclectic mix as the overcoming of the “dualism” between materialism and <br> idealism. Yang Sien-chos uses Lenin's critic <br> falsifying its content, denying any possibility of dialectical identity between thought and <br> Being, as the red line comrades analyze on the CCP in 1971: <br><br><br> “In his book Materialism and Empiriocriticism, Lenin fully criticized the macho theory of<br>put thinking and being in the same plane, that is, the reactionary subjective idealist fallacies <br> Proposed by Ernst Mach and Company that 'things are complex of sensations' and' <br> social and social conscience are identical '. Intentionally taking each other: the identity <br> Between thinking and the being and the macho fallacy that thinking and being are identical, Yang Sien-chos said <br> arbitrarily that Lenin's materialism and empiriciticism criticized from the beginning to the <br> End the identity between thinking and being ’.” (Redator Group for Revolutionary Mass Criticism) 94 <br> President Mao, where does the right ideas come from? , applauds these revisionist falsifications and <br> develops the formulation of the identity between thought and being in the following terms: <br> “People's social existence determines their thoughts. The correct ideas characteristic of <br> advanced class, once dominated by the masses, will become a material force to <br> transform society and the world. (…) In the beginning, knowledge is purely sensitive. To the <br> quantitatively accumulate this sensory knowledge will be produced a leap and will become <br> rational knowledge, in ideas. This is the process of knowledge. It is the first stage of the process <br> of knowledge as a whole, the stage that leads from objective matter to subjective consciousness, <br> From existence to ideas. (…) Soon the second stage of the knowledge process, the stage <br> that leads consciousness to matter, from ideas to existence, that is, to apply to social practice the <br> knowledge obtained in the first step, to see if these theories, policies, plans and resolutions can <br> achieve the expected consequences. Speaking in general terms, those that result well are suitable, <br> And those that result badly are wrong, especially in the struggle of humanity against nature. ” <br> (President Mao) 95 <br> President Mao even more crystalline the resolution of the important philosophical question of <br> identity between thought and being. Shows the dialectical movement of the mutual transformation of <br> thought and social existence. Highlights that, on the one hand, social existence determines the thinking of <br> people; On the other hand, the right ideas, when assumed by the masses, become a force <br> material capable of transforming society and the world. Shows how in the first stage of knowledge <br> objective matter becomes subjective consciousness, and as in the second stage of knowledge <br> Subjective consciousness becomes material strength. The two quality heels of the process of the <br> knowledge, that is, from practice to theory and theory to practice, correspond to the double movement of <br> identity between thought and being, when being becomes thought and when thought is <br> transforms into being. In this formulation the President Mao refutes the conception of Yang Sien-chun, who denies the <br> transformation of thought into material strength. In addition, it attacks the falsification made by Yang Sien-chun, who <br> transforms Lenin's critique to the absolute identity between thought and being in denial of identity <br> dialectic between these contrary aspects. After all, if there was this absolute identity between thought and <br> Being knowledge would be immediate; However, as the Marxist theory of knowledge establishes, the <br> knowledge is a process of approximation, reflex, objective reality by thought, process <br> This is mediated by social practice. <br> Yang Sien-Chen's critique of the absolute identity between social being and social conscience was completely <br> Farcers, what he pursued was to attack the Marxist theory of knowledge. As a revisionist philosopher, Yang <br> Sien-as shared the same essence as Bogadov's bourgeois positions and just as he denied the <br> Knowledge as a process of successive approach to objective truth. As the articles of the <br> Redator Group for Revolutionary Mass Criticism: <br> “Yang Sien-chen completely denied the need for a process for the knowledge of <br> objective things for man. In your eyes, it is 'idealism' when the subjective cannot <br> agree at once with the goal. From this nonsense, he invested against a point without <br> consider all the others, overwhelmingly exaggerating some passing and isolated defects that <br> They were difficult to avoid in our practical work and condemning them as 'idealists'. ” (Group <br> Editor for revolutionary mass criticism) 96 <br> As already demonstrated pages before, we insisted, President Mao, in 1963, fully refuted such a position <br> of the revisionist Yang. Starting from the rich experience of socialist construction in China still needed <br> plus the Marxist theory of knowledge, allow us to repeat it: <br><br><br> “In social struggles, the forces representing the advanced class sometimes suffer from some <br> failure, but not because their ideas are incorrect, except because in the correlation of forces in<br>struggle, the advanced forces at the moment are not yet as powerful as the reactionary, and for this <br> They fail temporarily, but they reach successes sooner or later. (…) In general, you can only <br> achieve correct knowledge after many reiterations of the process that leads from <br> matter to consciousness and consciousness to matter, that is, from practice to knowledge and <br> knowledge to practice. This is the Marxist theory of knowledge, this is the dialectical materialistic theory <br> of knowledge. ” (President Mao) 97 <br> President Mao, developing the Marxist theory of knowledge, touches ideological issues <br> extremely important for MCI in the present days. This is a scientific and proletarian way to face <br> errors and defeats. Even starting from a fair line a certain proportion of errors, in its application, will be <br> Inevitable, after all “failure is the mother of success”, much more valid for the one who pursues the truth. Just <br> After the repeated applications of a fair line it is possible to create the objective conditions that allow the <br> Inversion in the correlation of forces between revolution and counterrevolution. For the forces representing the future, <br> For revolutionary causes defeats can only be temporary and fleeting, so there <br> definitive defeat for the proletariat. Certainty in the future, the certainty that the proletariat will achieve success <br> Sooner or later, it should be an unshakable conviction of the communists. Only overflowing this <br> revolutionary optimism can do communists overcome all obstacles to destruction and <br> Shipping of imperialism and the whole reaction, as well as the class society. This is not subjectivism, this <br> It is an incarnation of revolutionary ideology, it is Marxist theory of knowledge, this is an important contribution of <br> President Mao. <br> Where do the right ideas come from? , the important successes of socialist construction in the early years of <br> 1960 and the beginning of the big debate against Kruschovista revisionism in July 1963, with the publication <br> From the famous Chinese letter, he pushed the revisionist positions on the CCP for a position of total defensive. <br> After the applauding of the rotten theory of the “synthesized economic base” and the “impossibility of identity <br> Between thought and being, ”Liu Shao-Chi, through Yang Sien-chos, tries one last card. Starting from <br> a more abstract argument about dialectics now argues that the law of contradiction, the identity of <br> Contrary, it could be synthesized in the philosophical principle that "two combine in one." This was a <br> subrepticious attempt to attack the principle formulated by President Mao that everything in the universe is one that <br> is divided into two. Still, in 1957, President Mao, in a dialectical method for the internal unit of the <br> Party, established this important philosophical synthesis: <br> "One is divided into two: this is a universal phenomenon, this is dialectical." (President Mao) 98 <br> In addition, it established in greater detail the universality of this phenomenon: <br> "Every thing is divided into two." “In human society, just as in nature, each <br> entity invariably divides into its different parts; There are only differences in <br> content and form under various concrete conditions. ” (President Mao) 99 <br> In raising the principle that “two combine in one,” Liu Shao-Chi sought to renew the rotten theory of <br> reconciliation of the contradictions of the Deberin School, fought by Stalin and President Mao in the years <br> of 1930. However, the formulations of Yang Sien-chos were more dangerous, as they sought to present themselves <br> as the correct and non -unilateral interpretation of the law of contradiction. How is typical of Yang revisionists <br> Sien-chin presented his argument in a subreptious manner. Presented its philosophical falsification <br> through articles by some of their pupils and with the argument that the law of contradiction could only be <br> fully understood from the two principles together: one is divided into two and two <br> combine in one. <br> The publication of the first revisionist article occurred in May 1964, in the philosophical magazine Kuangming <br> Ribao. From then on other revisionist articles were published, but what happened was mainly a <br> Avalanche of leftist articles by fighting and attacking the hidden revisionist conceptions in Fajuta <br> attempt to integrate two antagonistic philosophical principles. Among the three great philosophical struggles, the debate <br> in defense of the dialectical principle that one is divided into two, due to the large dimension that involved the struggle <br> of two lines became known as the great debate in the philosophical front. Just like conversations about <br> political economy in the experience of socialist construction in the USSR, which occurred in the late 1950s, <br><br><br> whose notes came to public during GRCP through the red guards, the conversations<br>Philosophical of President Mao Tsetung, who occurred in August 1964, dealing precisely from the topics of <br> philosophical controversy over one divided into two, also during the GRCP had their minutes published, from <br> Which, abroad, only its English version is known. All the materials of the philosophical controversy were <br> published in important PCCH newspapers and magazines such as Remina Ribao and Hongqi and constituted a <br> very important struggle of two mass lines against revisionism, representing a culmination <br> for the establishment of the law of contradiction as the unique fundamental law of materialistic dialectic. <br> The arguments of the right, although fallacious and counterfeitors were not simple to be rebound and, for <br> This, they demanded and implied a significant development of Marxist philosophy in the course of <br> Process of Maoism itself. <br> Yang Sien-chin presented as follows his rotten position: <br> “The idea of the unity of contrary simply means that both sides of a contradiction <br> They are inseparably connected. All things are two by combining one. So, in the resolution of <br> Problems, it is necessary to 'divide one in two' to adopt the method of integrating two into one. <br> Learning the law of the contrary unit is to acquire the ability to connect two ideas. Is needed to <br> capture the opposites in the contrary unit, always remember that both sides of something are <br> inseparably linked. This way it will be possible to avoid unilaterality in practical work. ” <br> (Yang sien-chin apud ai si-ch) 100 <br> The philosophical falsification of revisionists transforms the interdependence of aspects in contradiction into a <br> inseparable connection between the opposite aspects. Unilaterally take only the first sense of <br> Identity of the contrary, interdependence; and hide the second and most important sense of <br> Identity: the transformation of an aspect to its contrary. In addition, they formulate the eclectic principle that <br> In the analysis of a problem or contradiction it is necessary to divide one into two, but that the resolution of this <br> problem or contradiction should be integrated two into one. Thus generalize that the analysis would correspond <br> to divide one into two and the synthesis would correspond to integrate two into one: <br> “[According to Yang Sien-chos] the method of knowing things and solving problems includes both <br> aspects of analysis and synthesis, and that the one is divided into two applies only to analysis while <br> that 'integrating two in one' applies to synthesis. ” (Ai Si-Chi) 101 <br> In presenting this philosophical falsification, the revisionists never presented examples related to <br> Class struggle, since this would facilitate its unmasking. None of the revisionist articles, for <br> example, argues that the resolution of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie would be the combination of <br> Both aspects, or by the reconciliation of the contradiction between them. Defend this after the applauding of <br> Opportunistic line of the “synthesized economic base” would be a blatantly bourgeois position. Via de <br> rule, revisionists gave an example of the need to integrate two into one type <br> contradictions in the course of socialist construction that seeks a relative balance between the aspects <br> contradictory. This ruse of the opportunists is thus pointed out there si-chi: <br> “Yang Sien-chos and his friends concentrate their main energies on issues not directly <br> related to class struggle, in which they can easily hide their <br> true ideological colors. They concentrate on: reds and experts, work and rest, <br> Quality and quantity, industry and agriculture, and similar questions of synthesis and coordination. ” <br> (Ai Si-Chi) 102 <br> As it seeks to coordinate the advancement of industry with agriculture, how it was struggled to be red and <br> experts, the revisionists sought to confuse public opinion maintaining that this type of <br> contradictions was resolved by the method of integrating two into one. And that the principle that one is divided into two <br> it was worthless for this type of contradiction, as it would lead to unilateralism to an alleged separation of <br> industry and agriculture, etc. This revisionist ruse was the same copied by pachanda when in 2001 <br> launched his revisionist "Theory of Fusion." At first presented the need to merge the insurrectional way <br> with the siege of the city through the countryside, then the need to merge parliamentary work with the war <br> Popular to present, in 2008, the ultimate result of its “dialectical” combinations of the “fusion theory”: <br> the “joint dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie” 103. If Pachanda presented this forgery <br><br><br> Explicit as early as 2001, of course it would be defeated in the party. Therefore, which presented it in terms <br> more confused, with which he paved the land at the party's directive center, and then<br>smuggling, all its revisionist capitulation. On the left, from the then NCP (Maoist), would fit and all fit <br> be aware of these revisionist counterfeits, because then the danger of smuggling positions lies <br> bourgeois with the appearance of Marxist positions. <br> Like Pachanda, the Yang Sien-chun minions always used the metaphor of “walking with <br> two legs ”as a way to combat the supposed unilateralism of the Maoist principle that one is divided into <br> two. This revisionist forgery is thus formulated in its first article, May 1964: <br> “In the work of building socialism in China, there are many opposite aspects. Firstly, <br> the conditions must be found to connect together and to unite opposites, and to unite and <br> integrate opposites at work. To use symbolic language, this is 'walking with both legs'. <br> For example, the general line of socialist construction because we strive to the fullest and advance <br> consistently to achieve larger, faster, better and more economical results <br> expresses the law of the unity of the opposites. Larger results, faster, better and more <br> economic are mutually opposed and connected with each other, and also condition <br> mutually. There is a contradiction between larger and faster results, on the one hand, and between <br> better and more economical, on the other hand. However, larger and faster results do not <br> can be divorced from better and more economical results. ” (Ai Heng-Fu and Lin Ching-Shan) 104 <br> Revisionists intentionally confuse the need for coordination, relative balance, <br> balancing between two contradictory aspects, in a non-antagonistic contradiction, with the principle of <br> Integrate two in one. As was already established by President Mao in the correct treatment of <br> contradictions within the people, in the units of contrary in which the relative balance between the two <br> aspects, as in the case between larger and faster results, the recognition of <br> contradictions between them and through the struggle to reach balance at a new level. As they are opposed, <br> imbalance will always emerge, this imbalance can only be resolved by the struggle between aspects and not by <br> fusion or integration of both. Balance, therefore, is only reached through the struggle to maintain the aspect <br> main as dominant in the contradiction. As established by President Mao in the contradiction, the <br> contradictory aspects in a unit always develop unevenly and it is always necessary to struggle <br> so that the most advanced and necessary aspect predominates in the contrary unit. <br> Regarding the main aspect in a contradiction, revisionists falsify arguing that in <br> some types of contradiction either aspect can be the main thing: <br> “Regarding the contradiction between democracy and dictatorship, because contradictions within the people and <br> those with the enemy are intermediate and can be confused with each other, we must <br> clearly distinguish between them to prevent the enemy from exploring the situation when we are <br> talking about democracy, and to avoid giving false impressions to some people when we <br> We talk about dictatorship. And also, the dictatorship will eventually be eliminated, leaving only one <br> Communist Union of all the people. Of both aspects, democracy and centralism, anyone has <br> precedence over the other in real life. ” (Pan Hsiao-Yuan) 105 <br> The revisionists tergivers the maleist principles about the correct treatment of contradictions in the bosom <br> of the people, they falsify the law of contradiction and argue that in certain contradictions it does not matter <br> What is the main aspect in the unit. Once again, they use as an example a contradiction where <br> seeks a relative balance between the aspects, after all, whether in the party or in socialist society, there must be <br> Both centralism and democracy, both dictatorship and democracy. But this does not mean that between <br> Two aspects are not one of them that is the main one. Deny the main aspect of the contradiction and the struggle to <br> Let the new prevail is to deny the upward direction of the resolution of contradictions. In this way, in <br> contradiction between centralism and democracy, although a balance of both centralism should be sought <br> It is the main aspect of the contradiction. After all, democracy in party life aims to reach the unity of action, <br> for only the centralized action of the proletariat is able to destroy capitalism. This contradiction relates <br> with the unity between the collective and the individual, where, ultimately, the collective is the main aspect of <br> contradiction. However, under certain conditions democracy or the individual necessarily assume <br> the mainness of contradiction. <br><br><br> The left articles of the left of refuting and unmasking one by one the revisionist philosophical falsifications<br>revealing its vilian objective of creating a theoretical basis and a public opinion that justifies the restoration <br> capitalist. In doing so as a two-line struggle, these articles contribute a lot to emphasize elements <br> very important of the philosophical works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and, especially, President Mao <br> TSETUNG, which sometimes go unnoticed in a study outside the heat of the controversy. Let's see now <br> Some of the arguments on the left that applied the revisionist positions in those struggles. <br> Refuting the revisionist falsification that in the contradictions in which a relative balance is sought between <br> Opposites should apply the principle of integrating two into one, and that the motto of “walking with both legs” <br> formulated in the socialist construction line of the CCCH is used as if it corresponded to this principle <br> Revisionist, the maleist left article on the CCP states that: <br> “In the present internship, in China, between industry and agriculture and between workers and peasants <br> connected to them, there are not only two different property systems, two different types of <br> production relations and two different types of workers. Also, with regard to <br> development of industry or agriculture itself, there is objectively a constant <br> Imbalance, and such imbalance is also a contradiction. In order to develop the economy <br> national, the way of dealing with industry and agriculture is not to implement the two combine in <br> one, that is, to deny the contradiction between them, but to formulate guidelines and policies on the <br> face the contradiction. The party's general line for the development of the national economy, with the <br> agriculture as a basis and industry as a leading factor, was formulated on the basis of the analysis of <br> objective contradiction. The line of 'walking with both legs', and not with one, it was precisely <br> developed to correctly handle the contradiction between them. ” (Chin Jan) 106 <br> The conception of “walking with the two legs” starts precisely from the recognition of contradiction and the <br> correct management in its resolution. The resolution of the whole contradiction can only be the struggle of the opposites, <br> and the struggle of the contrary corresponds to the advanced aspect of the dominant in the contradiction. All balance <br> It can therefore only be relative and relative balance when necessary only leads to historical progress, <br> when the most advanced aspect predominates in the unity of the opposites. In contradiction between industry and <br> Agriculture, the general line of socialist construction provided for the gradual predominance of industry over agriculture <br> and, at the same time, the elimination of the difference between field and city, between workers and peasants, between <br> intellectual and manual work. Only with the predominance of industry could it advance in this regard, however, <br> Only taking agriculture as the basis could march forward in socialist construction. The resolution <br> of this contradiction, from a relatively balanced predominance of the industry on agriculture, <br> is marching for the transformation of the whole society, the countryside and the city, in a superior form of <br> social organization that are the popular communes. <br> Refuting the falsification that non-antagonistic contradictions would be resolved by the combination of two in <br> One, an article from the Maoist Left, in November 1964, maintains that: <br> “A struggle of life and death is the form of struggle of antagonistic contradictions; The opposite is the form of struggle <br> of non-antagonistic contradictions. (…) But just like all other contradictions the contradiction <br> between reds and experts must be resolved through a fight against both <br> aspects of contradiction, by replacing one aspect with another, and not by the way of integrating <br> Two in one'." (Kao Ta-Sheng and Feng Yu-Chang) 107 <br> Contradiction between reds and experts is a non-antagonistic contradiction, but as every contradiction <br> can only be resolved through the fight, not a fight in general, but the fight against the two <br> aspects of contradiction, by replacing one aspect with another. This is not a struggle of life and death, in the <br> However, it is still a frontal struggle, though gradual, between the two aspects of the contradiction. Regarding <br> The problem of the main aspect of the contradiction, in the same article it is emphasized that: <br> “In the contradiction between red and expert, red is the main aspect of contradiction and is the <br> command and the soul of proficiency; when the imbalance between red and expert is <br> Developed and intensified there will be only specialty and nothing red. So this contradiction <br> between reds and experts cannot be resolved without involving the issue of red; the struggle for <br> 'Promote the proletariat and destroy the bourgeoisie' must be conducted previously so that it can be <br> achieve both: reds and experts. ” (Kao Ta-Sheng and Feng Yu-Chang) 108 <br><br><br> Revisionist Yang Sien-chin falsifies the concept of analysis and synthesis pointing to the conclusion that<br>Resolution of all contradiction occurs through the combination of two in one. Present the analysis as a <br> Divide in two was just a ruse to camouflage his antagonism against President Mao Tsetung. A <br> Philosophical falsification of Yang Sien-chin transformed the unity of contrary into an indissoluble connection <br> among the opposite aspects. As this connection would be indissoluble, the resolution of the contradictions, according to the <br> Revisionists could only be achieved by harmonization or reconciliation of the two contradictory aspects. <br> The offensive of the Maoist left in the great philosophical debate, when rebate, this fallacy will emphasize <br> President Mao's important arguments on the issue. Demonstrating that both the beginning of a <br> process is one that is divided into two, as well as its resolution is by the division of unity <br> against the dissolution of this unit. When an aspect becomes its opposite modifies the <br> quality of the phenomenon or a new process arises. If the unity of opposites were never indissoluble <br> dominated aspect could become the dominant aspect. This mutual transformation of the contrary <br> occurs through the dissolution of the old contradictory unit. The identity of the opposites, therefore, in their <br> The most important sense is also one that is divided into two. When a certain pair of contrary <br> disappears and a new process of a new unit of contrary, this contradiction resolution <br> It is also one that is divided into two: from the old unity of contrary the aspects are detached, the aspect <br> Old man goes to the trash of history and the new aspect is divided into two giving a new process. <br> Returning Engels, the Maoist Left article at 1971 Peking Review, points out that: <br> “Materialist dialectic maintains that the nature of something is the contradictory condition within the <br> thing and its separation. Engels pointed out: ‘Dialectics demonstrated, from the results of the <br> experience we have so far had with nature, that all polar opposites are determined <br> by the reciprocal action of the two opposite poles, that separation and opposition to these opposites <br> there are within its mutual connection and its union and that, conversely, its union only exists in <br> Its separation, and its mutual connection exists only in its opposition '(nature dialectic). This wants <br> say that one cannot speak of the bonds between the two opposing aspects without their struggle and <br> separability. The struggle between two opposing aspects inevitably leads to the breach of <br> its interconnection, the disintegration of an entity and the change of nature of one thing. Therefore, <br> the interconnection between the two opposing aspects is conditional and relative while its <br> separation is unconditional and absolute. ” (Grupo Editor for Mass Criticism <br> Revolutionary) 109 <br> The refutation of Yang Sien-chun's philosophical falsification about the inseparable bond of the aspects of <br> contradiction, she sheds light on previous formulations of Marxist philosophy that precisely emphasize <br> unity between interdependence and separation in all contradictions. Highlighting that the unit <br> affirms mutual connection and struggle leads the separation of the opposite aspects, leading to the change of <br> nature of the thing. This reasoning was already contained in the contradiction, but the course of the struggle of <br> Two lines highlight these aspects pointing to their development. In 1937, President Mao <br> had established that: <br> “Understanding each aspect of a contradiction means understanding that position <br> specific occupies each of them, what concrete forms assume their relationships of interdependence and <br> contradiction with its opposite, and what concrete means employs in the struggle with its opposite <br> while both aspects are in interdependence and contradiction as after the rupture of the <br> interdependence." (President Mao) 110 <br> President Mao in this passage already points out that the contradiction resolution was due to the rupture of the <br> interdependence, by the division of the unity of opposites in two, thus disintegrating the contradiction and <br> giving rise to a new process or phenomenon. The fight against the philosophical falsification revisionist <br> boosted the left to resume this principle and to develop it with new arguments for the <br> Applause from the right. In the maleist left article, in July 1964, this problem is placed from the <br> following form: <br> “However, as we see, different qualitative processes cannot mix <br> each other. Different constitutive contrary that form different processes cannot be seen under <br> The same light. If a new process has begun, then this new process is by no means <br> "Two two combine in one" product, that is, the combination of the two contradiction of contradiction in <br><br><br> old process, but it is a process in which an aspect of the contradiction of the old process<br>triumphed on the other aspect, ending the old process by resolving the contradiction and <br> replacement with a new process. ” (Chin Jan) 111 <br> As already highlighted, in a unit of contrary the new aspect arises as an aspect <br> dominated, through the quantitative accumulation in the fight against the dominant aspect, the new aspect <br> It develops even becoming the dominant. Weak and dominated even strong and dominant, this is the qualitative leap that <br> transforms the nature of the phenomenon. The continuity of the same contradictory pair, in inverted positions, in the <br> new phenomenon develops with the old aspect seeking to restore dominance and the new aspect <br> (now dominant) seeking to settle the outdated aspect. The resolution of the contradiction or the objective synthesis <br> it constitutes the separation, the dissolution of this unit, in the full triumph of the new over the old and in the <br> emergence of a new process. <br> The great philosophical controversy is publicly terminated with the publication of the article by Ai Si-Chi, in May <br> 1965. This article summarizes the most developed formulation during the controversy and clearly points to the law <br> contradiction as a unique fundamental law of dialectic: <br> “The unity of contrary is the unity of the incessant struggle of contrary within things. (…) A <br> incessant struggle between the opposites constantly puts its unity in a tendency to <br> division and disintegration. In addition, division and disintegration will be the reality, sooner or later, <br> So things will become their old forms of movement to new forms of <br> movement, of quantitative changes to qualitative changes, from the affirmation to the <br> denial. This is exactly a process of dividing itself into two, the essence of the law of the unit of <br> contrary. ” (Ai Si-Chi) 112 <br> The struggle in defense of the dialectical principle that one is divided into two, in the great philosophical controversy, <br> boosted the resolution of the question raised by Engels in a dialectic of nature, about the connection between <br> The three basic laws of dialectic established by Hegel in Science of Logic. As already emphasized <br> Previously, President Mao, on the contradiction, had already shown that the foundation of the <br> Conversion of quantity into quality was the law of contradiction. During the defense that one is divided into <br> Two is the last link of the question. The denial of denial is explained from the law of contradiction and <br> particularly through the synthesis that one is divided into two. <br> When in the course of the debate it is emphasized that both the beginning of a process and its resolution occur in <br> compliance with a single and same dialectical principle of the division of unity, its separation, <br> It is evident that the process of origin, development and resolution of a contradiction advances <br> quantitative changes to qualitative changes, and: from the affirmation of that unit against the <br> denial of the same unit of contrary. Thus demonstrates that the dominant aspect is what seeks <br> affirm the unity of contrary, impose its domination through the struggle and through this to prevent the dissolution of the <br> unit. The new and dominated aspect, in turn, is what it seeks through the struggle to deny that unit of <br> contrary, dissolve that unity, and through the struggle transforming in a dominant aspect - denying <br> Thus the old contradiction, inaugurating a new process, or a phenomenon with a new quality. <br> In this formulation presented by left frames and so si-chi in the last article of the great controversy <br> Philosophical, appears in a single formulation, around a single dialectical principle, which were the three <br> basic laws of dialectic: one is divided into two as the essence of the law of contradiction revealing that the <br> conversion of quantity into quality and the transformation of the affirmation into denial, do not constitute laws <br> separated from the law of contradiction. The conversion of quantity into quality, and the transformation of the statement <br> In denial of the unity of contrary are inseparable elements of the law of contradiction. In all and all <br> Thing and phenomenon The contradiction arises immediately, that is, a thing or a phenomenon only exist <br> as unity and struggle of the contrary. Resolution of every contradiction, in turn, is never immediate, but <br> always resulting from a process. The process of resolution of every contradiction invariably travels a <br> quantitative change stage that becomes a qualitative change. The struggle of the aspects <br> contrary in turn, it is always a struggle for the affirmation of the unity of contrary by the dominant aspect <br> against the struggle for the negation of the unity of opposites by the dominated aspect. <br> In substantiating the denial of denial from the law of contradiction, defining it in its universal form <br> as the movement of affirmation to the denial of a unity of opposites, the great philosophical debate <br><br><br> She sheds light and is linked to the first contributions of the great Marx in the formulation of dialectical materialism. One<br>Maoist left article, it uses important citations of The Holy Family (1845), in which Marx and <br> Engels hit accounts with the metaphysical conceptions of the Hegelian young people. These passages illustrate <br> enlightening manner as the grounding of the affirmation and denial of a unit of opposites is the <br> contradiction law: <br> “Proletariat and wealth are antitheses. And in this condition they form a whole. Both are forms of the world <br> of private property. What is about it is the determined position that both occupy in the <br> antithesis. It is not enough to clarify them as both sides-or extreme-from a whole. The property <br> private in the condition of private property, as wealth, is obliged to maintain its own <br> existence and with it the existence of its opposite, the proletariat. This is the positive side of the antithesis, the <br> Private property that is satisfied with itself. The proletariat as a proletariat, from another <br> part, he is obliged to abolish himself and with that to his conditioning antithesis, the one that transforms him <br> In proletariat: private property. This is the negative side of the antithesis, its restlessness in itself, the <br> Private property that dissolves and dissolves. (…) Within this antithesis the private owner is, <br> Therefore, the conservative side, and the proletarian the destructive side. Of the first, the action that aims <br> preserve the antithesis, of the second the annihilation action of this antithesis. ” (Marx) 113 <br> Proletariat and bourgeoisie conform a unit of opposites. The bourgeoisie occupies the dominant position in <br> contradiction and with this is obliged to maintain its existence and also the existence of its opposite, the <br> Proletariat - which constitutes the source of its wealth. The bourgeoisie is the positive side of the contradiction, as it states <br> This unit of opposites is therefore the conservative side that seeks all means to keep this <br> unit. The proletariat is the negative side of contradiction, which needs to abolish bourgeois domination and with <br> This is also abolishing as a class; The proletariat is therefore the destructive side, which seeks to deny <br> Revolutionarily the unity of opposites that conform to bourgeois society. <br> Affirmation and denial is universal to all phenomena. The denial of denial, as already seen, is particular <br> to some types of phenomenon in which a chained and necessary sequential resolution occurs <br> units otherwise. Therefore, contrary to what UOC (MLM) says in its last tergiversation of <br> denial of denial, when President Mao speaks of affirmation and denial he is not changing the <br> name of the law, it is also changing its content, accordingly, as seen, with the conception of <br> World, revolutionary and proletarian, of Marx and Engels. <br> This significant philosophical development originated by the class struggle in socialist society and the <br> Acute two -line fight on the CCP, preceded and served as fuel and chisp for the grpc flames. <br> As the article at Peking Review of 1971 synthesizes: <br> “As promptly as the counterrevolutionary theory of Yang Sien-chos of‘ integrate two <br> In one, 'the proletarian headquarters headed by the President Mao reported, giving in the clove, <br> His true essence and drove and untyed an open criticism of Yang Sien-chos. Therefore, the vigorous <br> toast of masses of the great proletarian cultural revolution completely swept the Yang Sien-chos and <br> Your claim I love Liu Shao-Chi, as well as the bourgeois headquarters, to the mourning of history. ” (Group <br> Editor for revolutionary mass criticism) 114 <br> At the same time this great philosophical controversy that precedes and helps to prepare the great revolution <br> Proletarian cultural, was around the law of contradiction, as an article of the Maoist left highlights: <br> “The center of this controversy is whether or not the heart of dialectical materialism should be recognized <br> fact that the law of unity of contrary is the fundamental law of things, and it should be recognized <br> or not as the conception of the world and the methodology of the proletariat. ” (JAO CHING-HUANG) 115 <br> This was the question. And it was up to President Gonzalo, the direction of the PCP and the Popular War in Peru, <br> recognize, plant and support with the most rigorous scientific foundation, that the law of contradiction <br> constitutes the heart of dialectical materialism. In addition, President Gonzalo was the first to apply the law of <br> contradiction to the study of the development of the ideology of the international proletariat and to affirm it as the <br> only scientific ideology. In this way, President Gonzalo takes Marxism as a process in <br> course from which necessary steps of its development, corresponding to the movement of the <br> objective reality, societies and the world. Highlights that a new step corresponds to a <br> necessary development in the three constitutive parts of Marxism as a concrete of great leap <br><br><br> quality as a unit. Masterfully handling the law of contradiction in the fire of the class struggle of the<br>prolonged popular war will define Maoism as new, third and superior stage of development <br> Marxism, Marxism-Leninism, Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, especially Maoism: Ideology <br> From the international proletariat, almighty because scientific, true. In this definition describes the <br> Maoism as this great leap in the three constitutive parts of ideology as unity, reaping <br> firmly among other conclusions to establish that the law of contradiction is the unique fundamental law of <br> dialectic, because it is the law that governs eternal matter in its incessant transformation, in all its <br> Manifestations, nature, society and human thought. So I solve it definitively <br> the relationship between the universal aspects of the stage of ideology with the particular aspects of its application <br> concrete as a unity of opposites, fully formulating the theory of guide thinking as <br> peremptory need for each communist party towards the revolution of its respective country, resulting <br> of the creative application of the universal truths of the ideology of the international proletariat, in its most <br> developed and superior, to the concrete and particular reality of this country and their integration with practice <br> of the revolution in that same country. Thus, President Gonzalo points to the world's communists to <br> reconstruct/constitute militarized communist parties to trigger more popular wars by <br> revolution in their countries and the service of the world proletarian revolution and for putting Maoism as its <br> unique command and guides and sweep imperialism and the entire reaction of the face of the earth. <br> 2- AVAKIAN AND PRACHANDA: REVIEWS, CAPITULATION AND FILOSOPHICAL FRANITING <br> The very rich process of establishing the law of contradiction as a unique fundamental law of dialectic <br> Materialist traveled more than a century of development of the ideology of the international proletariat. A <br> more advanced theoretical formulation of Marxist philosophy resulted from fights of two lines extremely <br> important, led by President Mao on the CCCH and MCI, to give the necessary solution to the <br> challenging problems of the proletarian revolution. In the course of this process, it is confirmed that the phenomenon of <br> revisionism, as a reflection of the class struggle, from the point of view of the bourgeoisie, within the avant -garde <br> communist, tends to be enhanced when situations of major modifications of objective reality or <br> her requirement, in which new and crucial problems are presented to the revolutionaries, whether triumphs or <br> defeats. Two historical examples illustrate this phenomenon: after the triumph of the New Democracy Revolution <br> in China in 1949 and the challenge of becoming uninterrupted to the socialist revolution, the struggle is deepened <br> against the line of Liu Shao-Chi; after the defeat of the 1905 Revolution, in the Social Democratic Working Party <br> From Russia the Empiriocriticist influence takes shape. Revisionism is the ideological expression of capitulation, <br> whether in situations of great setbacks, or in positive situations but represent great challenges and <br> Risks to the revolutionaries. In addition, revisionism as a reactionary bourgeois current within the <br> proletariat and its avant -garde, seeks to substantiate its capitulation with a Marxist color in order to <br> hide your class content. It is impossible for revisionism to be theoretically based on materialism <br> dialectical, hence it is inevitable to the renegades, in one way or another, to falsify Marxist philosophy in the vain <br> attempt to support themselves to cover up their bourgeois positions and create public opinion that <br> justify. Therefore, dominance by the class and its avant -garde of dialectical materialistic philosophy, its principles <br> and fundamentals, it is an indispensable weapon to formulate and maintain the red line and for the <br> Required unmasking and applauding of revisionist positions. <br> The detailed study of the establishment of the law of contradiction and its essential principle that a <br> Divides in two weapons not only to have a correct balance of the RPM and MCI process and to resolve <br> new problems of the revolution, as to distinguish the exact content from Avakian's philosophy, <br> Prachanda, from Mirian LOD and other revisionists. Allows us to clearly see that behind the <br> formal divergence between those there is the same content, the same reactionary bourgeois philosophy, <br> idealistic and metaphysics. Avakian argues that the law of contradiction is the “basic law of dialectic”, in turn <br> Prachanda argues that in addition to this should also include the law of quantity and quality and denial of <br> denial; However, they are all against and oppose themselves veiled, but antagonically, to the content <br> Revolutionary of the Law of Contradiction. Avakian formally defends the principle that one is divided into two, <br> Prachanda in practice applies the fusion between the two antagonistic principles: one divides into two and two<br>integrate one. However, both apply in different ways only the revisionist principle of integrating <br> Two in one. <br><br><br> These two recent modalities of revisionism, Avakianism and Prachandismo, share a <br> same ideological essence: the essentially negative balance of the proletariat's dictatorship experience in the <br> twentieth century, nonsense criticism of comrade Stalin and President Mao, the cowardly <br> Yankee imperialism, the defense of lasting unity with the bourgeoisie and the small bourgeoisie in the <br> socialism and the need for a refounding of communist ideology. Both represent the same type <br> of opportunistic right -wing revisionism. Avakianism has the responsibility of starting this review and <br> Renegation of Marxism in the ranks of Maoism itself; falsification systematically undertaken by <br> Avakian since 1981. Prachandism has the responsibility for putting these conceptions into practice <br> In a concrete revolutionary process, shamefully betraying the Popular War in Nepal. <br> UOC (MLM), since the beginning of its conformation in the 1990s, shared many of these dogs <br> Avakianists from the early 1980s. Although they do not openly recognize, <br> ideological formulations, of their analyzes on imperialism, of their conception that they no longer exist <br> semi -feudal relations in the field of Colombia, that the character of the revolution in his country is already immediately <br> Socialist, they are based on revisionist theses formulated by Avakian. UOC (MLM) assumes the position <br> Avakianist against the universality of the New Democracy Revolution for all colonial countries and <br> semicolonials of the world, therefore considers the 1984 declaration of the MRI a setback in relation to the <br> Declaration of the Fall Conference of 1980. The founders of UOC (MLM) state, for example that: <br> “Before you will examine the way MRI and its members have referred to the problem [ <br> revolution in the countries oppressed by imperialism], it seems to me to be pertinent to mention the call of attention <br> that makes the comrade Avakian (…). This antimarxist, anti -materialist trend, on occasions reaches the <br> Cumulus of authorizing themselves in the comrade Mao TStung, literally taking his words <br> 'Colonial or semicolonial' with which droughts referred to in his work on the new democracy <br> to the oppressed countries in which the revolution should cross two steps. ” [UOC (MLM)] 116 <br> In his late criticism, insufficient and without any self -criticism of prachandism and avakianism, the <br> UOC (MLM), presents the Nepalese revisionist as an opportunism of the right and the 'hero' of the “new synthesis” <br> as "centrist", respectively. Do this for two reasons, camouflage your old affiliation with theses <br> Avakian reviewers of the 1980s and deny their convergence with Prachandism from 2001 to 2006, <br> When the capitulation and philosophical falsification of pacchanda became increasingly evident. A <br> UOC (MLM), in its journal, never tired of exalting the popular war in Nepal as the avant -garde of <br> World proletarian revolution, even in 2005, when the signs of revisionism were already too much <br> evident117. And this support was not restricted to the justified enthusiasm with the military achievements of <br> Nepalesa Revolution, as she extended to convergence with the Prachandist revisionist theses: <br> “Directed by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the Popular War advances in its offensive <br> strategy and, as part of the creative combination between armed struggle and peaceful struggle, <br> unilateral four -month fire strengthened mass adherence to party orientation and <br> Union of the political forces of society against the Nepalese monarchy. ” [UOC (MLM), February <br> 2006] 118 <br> Blatant defense of the theory of pacchandist fusion, integration, combination, conciliation of two <br> Opposite aspects: armed struggle and peaceful struggle. Does not plan the problem that the main form of struggle is the <br> Armed struggle, not even the question that the peaceful struggle is only justified when it serves the armed struggle. To the <br> Contrary, they openly defend the conciliation between the two opposite aspects of this contradiction. Conciliation <br> This can only lead, as it led, to the disarming of the masses and the betrayal of the revolution. In March 2006, the <br> UOC (MLM) exalts the revisionist direction of the PCN (M) and its rotten revisionist line in the following terms: <br> “Since the beginning of the popular war, the [PCN (M)] party has kept a correct line (…). A <br> CORRECT POLITICAL LINE WATERED BY PCN (M), based on a firm strategy and a tactic <br> flexible, it has allowed you to get great advances in the war, to the point that nowadays the forces <br> communists have the domain of more than 80% of the Nepalese territory, because due to its flexible tactic <br> obtained, without sacrificing the strategy, which is the state of new democracy, to win the parties <br> parliamentarians to make a single front against the monarchy. ” [UOC (MLM), March 2006] 119<br>In the same year 2006, UOC (MLM) loudly attacked the capitulation of the PCN direction (M) and the <br> Prachanda revisionism. It was boasting that it was the first organization in the world to have done this criticism <br> public and spared no words on his accusations to comrade Miguel Alonso, from the committee for <br><br><br> Reconstitution of the Communist Party of Galicia, demanding a public self-criticism. However, the <br> UOC (MLM) has never made any mention of its previous convergence with the pacchandist theses, <br> minimum self -criticism of these. <br> Armed with the analysis of the process of establishing the law of contradiction and the principle that a <br> divides in two in the development of the ideology of the international proletariat, we advance to the <br> Unmasking of the philosophical falsifications of Avakian, Pachanda and the convergence of UOC (MLM) <br> with these. <br> 2.1- The philosophical falsifications of Avakian from the early 1980s <br> In the late 1970s, the PCR-UUSA acted positively when it denounced the coup d'état <br> Counterrevolutionary of the Revisionist Damn of Teng Siao-Oping and the arrest of the leaders of the line of <br> Left of the CCP, the comrade Chiang Ching and the comrade Chang Chung-Chao. Moreover, <br> Next to the PCR-Chile, he summoned the 1980 autumn conference, which brought together parties and organizations <br> Revolutionaries seeking to reverse the dispersal of communist forces after capitalist restoration in China. <br> Despite the positive initiative, the limitations of the document's ideological and political content for the discussion <br> of the autumn conference already revealed the capitalist positions of Avakian. Analyzing Policy <br> China's International Revisionist of Teng Siao-Papa The document concludes that: <br> “(…) If China were a socialist country, its international line would represent a <br> extreme continuation of certain very serious mistakes previously made by MCI and, in <br> private, in the USSR when it was a socialist country, especially in relation to World War II <br> (…). ” [PCR-UUS and PCR-Chile] 120 <br> The document implies that the international line of renegade Teng was continuity of the comrade line <br> Stalin. This and other counterbreaks present in the autumn conference proposition document were <br> Only a sample of the typically small-bourgeois ideological vacillation of Avakian in the face of defeats <br> temporary proletariat. The reflux of the revolutionary struggle in the USA with the end of the war in Vietnam, in <br> 1975, with the capitalist restoration in China in 1976, and with the challenging situation against the defeat of the <br> Yankee imperialism in Vietnam (1975), Nicaragua (1979) and Iran (1980), in this case the theocratic regime <br> Islamic that complied with, performed the most brutal repression of the communists, was the environment in which <br> It consolidates the ideological break of Avakian. This derived the sinister of Avakian's path to seek <br> “Errors” in the ideology of the international proletariat with which he could present them as a cause to <br> those temporary defeats. Avakian denies the Marxist theory of knowledge and now consider, <br> Like the revisionist Yang Sien-chos, every error and all temporary defeat as a consequence of failures in <br> philosophical conception. <br> From 1981 to 1984, Avakian and his consorts systematically work on the philosophical falsification of Marxism <br> to give the theoretical basis to its revisionist line and to influence the MRI foundation conference. In 1981, <br> Avakian presents his philosophical falsifications in the following articles: once again about the issue of <br> dialectic, on the philosophical base of proletarian internationalism and main and fundamental contradictions to <br> world level. In these articles, Avakian attacks the grounds of the law of contradiction established fully <br> by President Mao. Still in 1981, Avakian presents his capitulating and defeatist balance of history <br> of MCI in the document conquer the world?, where he throws mud on the work of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and <br> President Mao. In 1984, they complete the theoretical foundation of its revisionist line, through the book <br> published on behalf of Raymmond Lotta, America in decline, where they present their rotten position that the <br> Interimperialist contradiction is the main contradiction in the world in the imperialist stage of capitalism. <br> Returning these documents is important to demonstrate how the “new synthesis” was not <br> something produced in the 21st century, but a revisionist line has long been gestated and cooked in the parsley of <br> arguments that were already formulated by Avakian before the founding of the MRI in 1984. analyze these <br> texts is important to demonstrate how the 1984 conference mainly represented a <br> defeat to the Avakianist line, as most of his theses were rejected by the set of parties in them <br> participants. Avakianist theses rejected, are precisely the points that the UOC (MLM) regrets that<br>were in the 1980 statement, but not in 1984. At the same time, analyzing this manual of <br><br><br> sophisticated revisionism, reveals that the negative aspects still contained in the 1984 statement are all <br> They were avakianist smuggling formulated in the early 1980s. <br> The balance of development of the ideology of the international proletariat made by the renegade Avakian, in the <br> early 1980s, can be synthesized in this statement of yours: <br> “(…) Without Leninism, Marxism is social chauvinism and Eurocentric social-democracy; without <br> Leninism, Maoism is nationalism (and also in certain social contexts chauvinism) and <br> bourgeois democracy. ” (AVAKIAN, 1981) 121 <br> In an alleged defense of Leninism, which would raise Marxism and at the same time would bark Maoism, <br> Avakian throws mud in the ideology of the international proletariat. Although, it formally declares that the aspect <br> Main in this ideology would be positive, all its evaluation leads to the contrary; broken <br> ideologically in the face of temporary defeats, Avakian can only take Marxism as a <br> huddled with errors. And of course his defense of Leninism is false, so much so that Avakian in the same text states <br> what: <br> "(…) There is a certain bourgeois logic in this reasoning of Lenin." (AVAKIAN, 1981) 122 <br> And about President Mao, Avakian blatantly states that: <br> “(…) Even in hand, despite being in contradiction with its contributions to dialectic <br> materialistic and its development of it, manifest some metaphysical trends that <br> interrelate with nationalist trends in this respect. ” (AVAKIAN, 1981) 123 <br> This is the ideological balance of renegade Avakian, applauded by UOC (MLM) in the 1990s and characterized <br> as a centrist at the beginning of the 2000. later, in his critique of the evident capitulationism of <br> Prachanda, Avakian would try to present his dislike of MCI in disguise from the dialectical principle <br> revolutionary: <br> “(…) [The] Marxism-Leninism-Maoism," divides into two ": its revolutionary, correct and <br> scientific that, in turn, is validated is advancing to new levels; the errors that identified themselves in <br> politics and theory that still secondary are real and harmful and one can and need to combat them <br> as part of making the jump that requires. ” (PCR-UUS, 2012) 124 <br> Another of the Small Burgers Philosophical Falsifications of Avakian. Evident, that the ideology of the proletariat <br> international, in each of its stages, dealt with hits and errors and progressed mainly supporting <br> if in the first, and through the rectification of the seconds, gaining experience in their management, in a <br> increasing approach to objective truth. But in each of the steps, what was defined as the <br> elements of the doctrine of the proletariat, in its three constitutive parts, are the true aspects <br> Proven by the revolutionary practice of class struggle, in the course of more than 170 years. Marxism- <br> Leninism-Maoism is, therefore, a set of countless integrated truths, as scientific doctrine and <br> Not a jumble of hits and errors. Like everything in the universe, the ideology of the international proletariat is a <br> which is divided into two, but not on hits and errors, but in universal truths and particular truths. <br> There are truths forged in Marxism that were valid only to Europe of the nineteenth century, <br> particular truths that are no longer universal today. But they did not become mistakes. The ideology of <br> international proletariat, the leap in its stages, move mainly, according to the need for <br> solve new problems that arise and will always arise in the arena of international class struggle and in each <br> country. <br> Avakian in his pseudoscience is a typical small-bourgeois hunter without any practice <br> revolutionary, in addition to their readings and speculative formulations on the revolutionary practice of others, <br> without the risks of the real practice of class struggle. Since the pulpit where it utters its sentences has been judging <br> those who actually risk doing the evolutionary work and who, in doing so, inevitably committed certain <br> amount of errors and suffer defeats, persist in the struggle rectifying the mistakes and advance ahead with victories, <br> They suffer new defeats, they persist until the struggle completely triumphs. Against this kind of people Lenin declared <br> powerfully: <br><br><br> “The capitalists and their minions (including mensheviks and right -wing socialists) shout that we have <br> made mistakes. Behind 100 errors, there were 100 large and heroic actions, simple actions, <br> discreet and hidden in the daily life of factories or villages. ” (Lenin) 125 <br> To support this capitulating balance of the ideology of the international proletariat, it was essential <br> For Avakian to attack the heart of dialectical materialism, that is, the law of contradiction. All <br> Revisionist, Avakian makes this attack allegedly defending President Mao's formulations. The ruse of<br>Avakian is to attack the use of denial of denial by Marx and Engels aiming one of the foundations of the law of <br> contradiction. Attacking Engels' exemplification of barley cycle from the denial of denial, <br> Avakian declares: <br> “[Engels states] that grinding this grain [of barley] will not lead to the denial of denial arguing <br> that 'every kind of thing has its characteristic form of being denied' (anti-dühring). But what that <br> Does it have to do with dialectics? Why, and whoever said, that everything has its 'characteristic' way of being <br> denied? This smells like predetermination and notion of the unchanging essence of things. Mao opposed <br> this kind of thinking when he indicated that heredity and mutation are a unit of <br> contrary. Here we can see how the concept of denial of denial is in <br> antagonism with the current fundamental law of dialectical materialism, the unity of opposites <br> (contradiction)." (AVAKIAN, 1981) 126 <br> Here you can see a typical procedure of Avakianist counterfeits: puts one of the classics against the <br> another to attack the essence of their position. In this case puts President Mao in a position <br> antagonistic in relation to the great Engels. Places a wall of China between the denial of denial in its <br> Use by Marx and Engels and the law of Maoist contradiction. Do this to find a big "error" in the first <br> step and an alleged “resolution” in the third. Then account for everyone's error and appears as the Redeemer <br> that rectifies them all in their “new synthesis”. This is a shameful, counterfeit procedure. As <br> We were able to analyze previously, in the very course of the first stage, particularly in the work of Engels <br> (Anti-dühring) The theoretical formulation of Marxist philosophy advances from denial of denial to contradiction. <br> We have also seen that there is no antagonism between denial of denial and contradiction; After all, the <br> denial of denial is only a particular form of the resolution of the contrary unit. In addition, the <br> Avakian's forgery is so vile that he claims that it was President Mao who would have identified the unit <br> of contrary between heredity and mutation in the life cycle of barley, and it is the Engels itself who <br> points this contradiction: <br> “The theory of evolution, starting with the simple cell, demonstrates how all progress to the plant <br> more complex on the one hand and even the human being on the other is made by the permanent conflict between <br> heredity and adaptation. ” (Engels) 127 <br> Typical revisionism maneuver: Small textual fraud to smuggle great forgery in content <br> ideological. Avakian says that the denial of denial “smells of predetermination”, considers absurd the <br> Engels reasoning that each thing has a characteristic way of being denied. For the renegade, a <br> Conclusion as this would constitute determinism, teleology. Discovering the necessary laws in a phenomenon is the <br> Science task; Marxism discovered the necessary laws of capitalism and, therefore, was constituted as a <br> scientific ideology. It is Marx himself who synthesizes his scientific discoveries as follows: <br> “As far as I am concerned, it is not for me to have discovered the existence of the classes in the <br> modern society nor its struggle among themselves. Long before me, bourgeois historians had <br> exposed the historical development of this struggle of classes, and bourgeois economists the anatomy <br> of them. What I did again, was: <br> 1. Demonstrate that the existence of the classes is only linked to certain phases of development <br> production history; <br> 2. that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; <br> 3. That this same dictatorship only constitutes the transition to overcoming all classes and to a <br> society without classes. ” (Marx) 128 <br> The need for the dictatorship of the proletariat is a social law discovered by Marx and not a predetermination <br> teleological by it built. Bourgeois society has a particular way of being denied and this form is <br> The dictatorship of the proletariat as a transition to the overcoming of social classes, communism. The president <br><br><br> Mao, contrary to what the Avakian prestidigator states, does not turn against it. On the contrary, it establishes <br> as a universal law that the new aspect in a unity of contrary will necessarily become the aspect <br> Principal of contradiction, that is, will deny the old unity of opposites: <br> “We often talk about the 'replacement of the old with the new'. Such is the general and imprescriptible law of the <br> Universe. The transformation of one phenomenon into another, by jumps whose forms vary according to the <br> character of the phenomenon itself and according to the conditions under which it is, this is the process of <br> Substitution of the old man with the new. Whatever phenomenon is, there is always a contradiction between the <br> old and the new, which determines a series of winding course struggles. Of these struggles it results that the new <br> grows and rises to the dominant position, while the old man, on the contrary, decreases and ends<br>to die. As soon as the new gains a dominant position on the old man, the old phenomenon <br> transforms qualitatively into a new phenomenon. ” (President Mao) 129 <br> Every process has a particular way of being denied: the new aspect denies the old process, transforms <br> if in the dominant aspect and changes the quality of the phenomenon. The antagonism between Engels and President Mao <br> It's just avakianist forgery. What he wants to deny is the Marxist theory of knowledge that <br> establishes that in the active process of humanity, through social practice, human consciousness can <br> reflect the essence of phenomena, discover their laws and thus transform reality according to their <br> goals. For bourgeois science, for its relativistic reactionary philosophy, this is determinism. For the <br> Proletariat This is science, it is materialism, it is dialectical. <br> Avakian from the critique of the use by Marx and Engels of denial of denial in the early 1980s, <br> It intended to smuggle the masked philosophical relativism of scientific criticism. Well to the taste of philosophy <br> Michel Foucault and Company, Precursors of Postmodernism that today's grace in <br> Academy, Avakian rises against the law of contradiction that states that the replacement of the old man with the new <br> "It is the general and imprescriptible law of the universe." Avakian is against this universal truth, and through one of his <br> Asseclas states that: <br> “This is the process of synthesis, the creation of the new, it can only proceed through the fight against and <br> eventually replace the old man. ” (Lenny Wolf, 1983) 130 <br> AND: <br> “In a sense, the more an idea corresponds to reality the more unpredictable the <br> paths in which it will transform given reality. ” (Lenny Wolf, 1983) 131 <br> In the early 1980s, Avakian presented his relativist idealism in ridiculous paradoxes like this. <br> In the 2000s, it uses even thicker falsifications to pass their smuggling. Analyzing <br> Marx's cited passage that speaks of the imprescriptible need for the dictatorship of the proletariat, Avakian <br> Tergiversa as follows: <br> “Regarding the word 'necessarily': I have to say that for me it is not totally clear, <br> precisely, what Marx meant by 'necessarily' in this context, but the relationship - and, in <br> particular, the difference - between 'necessity' and 'inevitability' is a very <br> important." (AVAKIAN, 2019) 132 <br> Charlata as always, Avakian initially tries to make a distinction between “need” versus <br> inevitability. And then to achieve its true objective: <br> “The purpose of communism, the necessary process that leads to it - the revolution and the transformation <br> profound of society and, ultimately, of the world as a whole (…) and the possibility (not <br> inevitability but the possibility) of this revolution: all this is established by any <br> Subjective and utopian fantasy type, but which is established on a scientific base (…). Here, <br> as indicated in the observation that contrasts the possibility with inevitability, <br> crucial distinction and a profound question of methodology. In the history of the communist movement, since <br> The moment of its foundation, there was a tendency to 'inevitabilism' - the erroneous belief that the <br> historical development will inevitably lead to the triumph of communism (…). ” (AVAKIAN, <br> 2019) 133 <br><br><br> Avakian opposes the need for inevitability and then inevitability to the possibility; thus denies sub- <br> Marx's statement that “class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the <br> proletariat ”, transforming the need for communism into a mere possibility. Deny <br> of communism, to convert it to the Small Bureau taste into a possibility of many, this is the goal <br> ideological of Avakian's philosophical falsification. Therefore, when the President Mao is opposed to Engels, aims at <br> Appearance in the use of denial of denial, to get the law of contradiction right in essence. <br> But Avakian not only denies the Marxist theory of knowledge, that is, the possibility of reflecting the laws <br> society's objectives to transform it, acting in accordance with these laws, transforming the <br> need. Avakian, besides being a relativist is a metaphysical and opposes the dialectical conception of the world that <br> It predicts that the transformation of all things and phenomena occur from their internal causes; that the <br> external conditions influence the development of the phenomenon, but always act through their <br> internal contradictions. <br> As part of his MCI's capitulating balance, Avakian identifies a supposed nationalist “error” <br> Engels, Stalin and President Mao practices. According to him this “error” would be linked to a conception <br> metaphysics about the relationship of the internal and external factors of a given process. Managing<br>sophisticated way opposite aspects in a non-antagonistic contradiction, just as the <br> revisionists advocates of the principle of integrating two into one, Avakian presents as follows his <br> Pastiche: <br> “[For Mao]… the internal causes are indeed primarily in relation to the external ones. (…) But in certain <br> measure, there was a tendency to conceive and apply this principle metaphysically, which was <br> linked to a certain amount of nationalism in the Chinese party, including among Marxist genuine <br> Leninists, including hand. In fact, this trend was in opposition to another highlighted principle <br> on contradiction: ‘given that the variety of things is immeasurable and their development <br> It has no limits, which is universal in a context is particularly made in another context, and vice versa. <br> This means that what is internal in one context becomes external into another and vice <br> Versa. China, for example (or uses, or any other country), has its own particularity, its <br> particular contradiction itself and, in a context, the rest of the world (and struggles and transformations in this) <br> It is external (for China, or USA, etc). But it is also true that, in another context, China and uses and the <br> rest of countries in the world form parts of the world (of human society) as a whole, with their <br> internal contradiction and its transformation, determined in a general sense by the contradiction <br> Fundamental of the bourgeois time, between socialized production and private appropriation. This means that <br> in general the development of class struggle (and national), the development of <br> revolutionary situations, etc., in private countries are more determined by the <br> development in the world as a whole than for development in countries in particular <br> - Determined not only, as a condition of change (external cause) but as the base of <br> Change (internal cause). ” (AVAKIAN, 1981) 134 <br> Avakian is a Sicophant that seeks to intentionally confuse things. First says that President Mao <br> conceives the dialectical relationship between internal (as a base) and external causes (as conditioning) <br> Metaphysical way, that is, as if there was no identity of opposites between these two opposite aspects. <br> This is a blatant lie, because in the contradiction itself, President Mao gives us a <br> historical example and how internal transformations in a country can imply qualitative modification <br> of external conditions, that is, from the world as a whole: <br> “Does materialist dialectic exclude external causes? No. The materialistic dialectic considers that the <br> external causes constitute the condition of change and the internal causes, their base, and that they act <br> through these. (…) There is constant mutual influence between the peoples of different countries. In season <br> capitalism, especially at the time of imperialism and the proletarian revolution, are <br> extremely large the mutual influence and interaction between the various countries on the land <br> political, economic and cultural. The October Socialist Revolution inaugurated a new era not only <br> In the history of Russia, but also in world history. Has exerted an influence on <br> internal changes in other countries in the world and also, with special depth, in the changes <br> Internal China. Such changes, however, took place through their internal laws of <br> said countries, including China. ” (President Mao) 135 <br> What is nationalism in the conception of President Mao about the relationship between the revolution in a <br> certain country and the world revolution? What is metaphysics in the Maoist formulation of the relationship <br><br><br> between the internal and external conditions of a particular process? By no means, President Mao <br> denies the identity of opposites between internal and external conditions. As evident in the passage above, <br> the October socialist revolution, that is, the internal transformation in a country given determined a <br> Modification in the world situation as a whole, inaugurating a new era in world history. What is this <br> Does it mean philosophically? That the internal condition of a country has become the dominant aspect of <br> Contradiction, determining and influenced every and one of the countries of the world. However, this identity <br> contrary does not deny the dialectical principle that are always the internal causes that constitute the basis of <br> development and transformation of a process. After all, as President Mao points out, the modification <br> that the Russian Revolution determines in the international situation operates in each country as and through its <br> internal contradictions. That is, the grass determined for example the modification of the character of the revolution <br> Chinese, which of the Democratic Revolution of an old type would have to be from then on new revolution <br> Democracy; However, the GRSO did not change the character of the French Revolution, which followed as before <br> demanding a socialist revolution.<br>In addition to falsifying and lying about President Mao's philosophical and ideological conclusions, Avakian distort <br> The content of the identity of opposites. According to the materialistic dialectic, the transformation of an aspect into <br> Its opposite means that the dominant aspect becomes dominated, and vice versa. Avakian, falsifies this <br> content and states that in a given context a contrary becomes the same as its opposite, thus eliminating <br> The difference between them. That is, for Avakian, in certain contexts, external = internal and vice versa. <br> Thus, it comes to the height of the sofistoria when it states that in a certain context the world, that is, the <br> External becomes the internal, on the basis of change. In this way, it attributes to the fundamental contradiction of the <br> capitalist process (social production x private appropriation) in the internal contradiction of this world. If the <br> World becomes the “internal”, what would be external? Each country in particular or the galaxy? None of <br> two, since the identity of Avakian's opposites is the old absolute identity of the opposites, for him the <br> mutual transformation is not one in which opposites fight with each other, change their position maintaining their <br> differences and their mutual struggle. For Avakian, mutual transformation is the equalization of the opposites, <br> There is the difference between internal and external, and a “revolution” arises that is immediately international. But <br> This can only be a speculative “revolution”, because in denying that the world proletarian revolution occurs in <br> Each country, Avakian denies that among these countries there is an unequal development of the revolutionary situation. <br> This theory has nothing new, it is just the reissue of the rotten Trotskyist conception that denies the possibility <br> of socialism in one country. Not by chance, he shamelessly states: <br> “We have to advance with impetus and firmness under the glorious ideological banner of‘ nihilism <br> national'." (AVAKIAN, 1981) 136 <br> Avakian's attack on the law of contradiction does not stop there. With a pseudo-left option, Avakian <br> raises against the main contradiction, in a supposed defense that the proletarian revolution can only win if <br> Lock fighting against the enemy in all directions and at the same time. Thus, after attacking the supposed <br> "Nationalism" of President Mao who "did not take the external conditions as internal," Avakian says <br> what: <br> “And together with this, too, it reveals itself in a certain recurring tendency to convert to principle <br> The policy of using contradictions between enemies, of defeating enemies one by one. ” (AVAKIAN, <br> 1981) 137 <br> AND: <br> “There is no principle that determines that I have to do it that way; If I am able to defeat them to <br> all at once, I must because they violate them all and turn them into pieces and so much better for the <br> international proletariat. ” (AVAKIAN, 1981) 138 <br> This is Avakian in the early 1980s, the farce of a Wang Ming, a battle general. To the <br> Philosophical counterfeits are: 1) Subjectivist idealism: transforms the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat <br> in mere “possibility”; 2) denies that internal causes are the basis of the transformation of phenomena and <br> External causes the conditions of transformation; 3) denies the existence of a main contradiction in a <br> phenomenon and advocates the resolution of all contradictions at once. These philosophical falsifications <br> They were part of the Avakianist engineer to formulate their revisionist line. From the point of view of <br><br><br> Historical materialism, Avakian, still in 1981, turns against the law discovered by Marxism that “(…) <br> The class struggle is the engine of history ”139. According to the renegade: <br> “The driving force that drives this process is indeed the anarchy of capitalist production, still <br> that the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is an integral part of the contradiction between the <br> socialized production and capitalist appropriation. Although the exploitation of the workforce is <br> the form and method by which the added value is created and appropriate, are the anarchic relations between the <br> capitalist producers and not simply the pure existence of dismissed proletarians or <br> contradiction of classes itself, which leads to these producers to explore the working class on a scale <br> more intense and extensive historical. This driving force of anarchy is an expression of the fact that the <br> capitalist mode of production represents the complete development of the production of goods and <br> of the law of value. If this were not the case where these goods of goods existed <br> independent of each other and at the same time were intertwined by the operation of the <br> law of value, would not feel the same coercion to explore the proletariat - the contradiction between the <br> bourgeoisie and the proletariat could mitigate. It is the internal coercion of capital to expand, which <br> explains the dynamism without historical precedent of this mode of production, a process that transforms <br> continuously the relationships of value and leading to crises. ” (AVAKIAN, 1981) 140<br>The disadvantage of a revisionist has no limits, Avakian transforms the anarchy of production, the contradiction <br> Among the capitalists, in the driving force of the capitalist process. Marx in The Capital, as seen above, <br> analyzes the importance of competition among capitalists, shows how capitalist property <br> through competition engenders the expropriation of the means of production among the bourgeoisie itself. This one <br> fact is an indispensable dynamic factor for capitalist development, but transforming this contradiction into <br> History driving force is just cheap revisionism. In addition, Avakian concludes that if it weren't for <br> Contradiction between the bourgeoisie the exploitation of the proletariat could mitigate; This is the same reasoning as <br> renegade Kautksy who argued that the monopolistic trend of imperialism could soften the <br> Antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat. Avakian says it is competition among capitalists and not <br> search for added value, which leads these “producers” to explore the working class in a more intense and <br> extensive. <br> For Marxism, the capital's self -expansion movement has a clear origin: the social contradiction between <br> the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. This production relationship has as particular product, proper to the mode of <br> capitalist production, the surplus value. Surplus value is the non-paid work by the capitalist who becomes <br> capital. Capital produces surplus value, the accumulated added value becomes capital. This is the process <br> Economic of self -expansion of the capital discovered by Marx. Free competition acts as an external cause <br> indispensable of this process, but the base is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the production <br> social and private appropriation. Surplus value, non-paid work, profit constitutes the leitmotiv of production <br> capitalist. The self -expansion of capital is its unavoidable result; The free the competition <br> among the capitalists, faster this self -studio will be, faster will be the centralization of capital, more <br> acute will be the fundamental contradiction of capitalist society and better will be the conditions for its <br> resolution. However, the resolution of this contradiction can only be due to the ideological strengthening of the <br> aspect dominated in the contradiction, that is, the proletariat, because this is the social representative class and political <br> Social production in fight against private property. Capitalists are the individual representatives of <br> dominant aspect of the fundamental contradiction, the contradiction between them, either in the phase of free competition, <br> Whether in monopolies, the imperialist influence the resolution of the contradiction, but do not determine it. <br> Only the struggle between the opposite aspects of a contradiction can resolve this contradiction. <br> In 1984, in the book America in decline, Avakian and Lotta try to substantiate the political economy <br> Marxist plus this forgery in historical and dialectical materialism. As a typical procedure of <br> revisionists, they start from a small textual fraud to engender a great falsification of <br> Marxist principles. Lotta states that: <br> “There are two manifestations, two forms of movement, of the contradiction between social production and <br> Private Appropriation: (1) The contradiction between organized character in individual companies (or in a <br> higher and more integrated level of ownership) and anarchy in social production as a whole; <br> and (2) the contradiction in class relations between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. According to Engels: <br> ‘It is in these two forms of manifestation of the immanent contradiction to him by origin that the <br> Capitalist mode of production. '(…) The theoretical and political implications of this anti-pass <br> Dühring need subsequent interpretation and elaboration. First, the fundamental contradiction of the <br><br><br> Capitalism is the founding material for these two forms of movement. (…) But stop <br> highlight the point again, the movement driven by anarchy is the main form of <br> contradiction movement between social production and private appropriation. ” (Lotta, 1984) 141 <br> Lotta states that Engels would have established two forms of movement of the fundamental contradiction, but that <br> a subsequent development of this formulation was lacking, duly done by him and Avakian when <br> establish which of these forms would be the main one. Falsify the citation of Engels, to intentionally <br> seek a false foundation in Marxism for its rotten theory that the anarchy of social production, <br> Interburgers and interimperialist contradictions are more important than the contradiction between the proletariat <br> and the bourgeoisie and between the oppressed nations and imperialism. Let us resume, the complete passage of Engels to <br> see with precision in what terms he puts: <br> “The contradiction between social production and capitalist appropriation reproduces itself as antagonism <br> between the organization of production in the individual factory and the anarchy of production in the whole society. AND<br>in these two manifestations of the immanent contradiction to him by his origin that the mode of <br> capitalist production ”. (Engels) 142 <br> The two forms of movement of the contradiction, therefore, highlighted by Engels are: 1) social production <br> Versus Private Appropriation, and 2) Organization of production versus anarchy of social production. Both <br> forms are inseparable, but the first is evidently the main, as it is the basis of the production of <br> added value. Production anarchy results from the relationship between capitalist production, that is, the production of <br> added value and its corresponding circulation mode: free competition. Production of added value and free <br> Competition result in anarchy of social production. Lotta falsifies this passage saying that the two <br> forms of movement would be: 1) the anarchy of social production and 2) the contradiction of classes. <br> But this little textual fraud of Avakian and Lotta, retained numerous times in the PCR-Usa publications, <br> over the past few decades, it is nothing in the face of the content of the revised international political line that <br> seek to substantiate with this forgery. From this set of philosophical falsifications and the balance <br> capitulating ideological that make the process of the world proletarian revolution and MCI, Avakian <br> formulates its international line based on the following dogmas: 1) Imperialism implies the transformation <br> of the world in a single and same production process; 2) Therefore, the international arena becomes the condition <br> “Internal” for the revolution in each country, so the revolutionary transformation in a nation is <br> mainly determined by the international situation and not the degree of development of their <br> internal contradictions; 3) The fundamental contradiction of the capitalist process is the “internal” contradiction of <br> Revolution in the International Arena; 4) The main form of movement of this contradiction is the anarchy of <br> social production, the interburgers and interimperialist contradictions; 5) This main form of movement of the <br> fundamental contradiction determines the mainly dynamic character of imperialism that thus “sweeps <br> Semi -Feudal Production Relations ”in the semicolonial countries; 6) It is the development of contradictions <br> interIIIMPERIALISTS, a developed form of production anarchy, which creates the conditions for the advancement of the struggle <br> of classes and the world proletarian revolution. <br> Let us quickly look at the political consequences of all Avakianist philosophical falsification, synthesized in <br> Points 5 and 6. <br> “World capitalism confronts and must subsuce pre-existing social and economic structures. <br> On a world scale, imperialism works towards undermining and transforming the ways <br> Pre-Capitalists. This occurs through the force of competition or through the direct capitalization of the <br> productive factors, including the workforce - the result of this is to accelerate the expulsion of <br> peasants of subsisting economy and artisanal works of the field. ” (Lotta, 1985) 143 <br> Thus, according to Avakian and Lotta, imperialism retains the progressive character of free capitalism <br> competition that expanded through the dissolution of pre-capitalist production relations. For the <br> AVAKIANISO IMPERIALISM develops, reaches the maximization of profits through the destruction of <br> pre-capitalist production modes and not relying on the semi-feudal relations that constitute a <br> decisive internal foundation for national oppression. For Avakianism not only imperialism in general <br> It acts in this regard, but even the interimperialist wars: <br><br><br> “In addition, the interimperialist worlds are, first and foremost, military disputes by minors <br> or greater victories, its immediate result can, in some important aspects, do not <br> economic results of lasting expansion (even because such wars objectively <br> recomposes the conditions for accumulation). But ignoring the specific terms of the redivision and <br> reorganization, jumps are made in the organization at the individual and national level of capital - and in <br> dissolution of precapitalist relationships around the world. ” (Lotta, 1984) 144 <br> This is the typical Trotskyist conception of imperialism, opposite the diametrical of Leninist formulations. Lenin <br> repudiates the whole thesis of a supposed progressive character of imperialism, it formulates that: <br> “Imperialism is the time of financial capital and monopolies, which bring with them, throughout <br> Part, the tendency towards domination, not for freedom. The reaction in the entire line, whatever <br> it is the political regime; the extreme exacerbation of contradictions also in this sphere: such is the result <br> of this trend. Also intensifies national oppression and the tendency for <br> annexations, that is, for the violation of national independence (because the annexation is but the <br> violation of the law of nations to self -determination). ” (Lenin) 145<br>The revisionist forgery in defining the anarchy of production, as a form of main movement of the <br> fundamental contradiction of the capitalist process, aims solely and exclusively to create a theoretical basis that <br> Justify the rotten Avakianist thesis that the imperialist war is to decide the future of the proletarian revolution <br> Worldwide. Avakian's hope has always been deposited in the conflagration of a new World War <br> imperialist, as a condition for the advancement of the revolution. As Lotta explicitly formulates, in 2014, the <br> anarchy of production and the interim contradiction derived from it: <br> “(…) It is what prepares the main scenario for what to do to transform society <br> It's the world." (Lotta, 2014) 146 <br> For these revisionists the class struggle is not the engine of history but that the development of <br> inter-imperialist contradiction, after all it would be the development of this contradiction that would create the conditions for <br> May the revolutions occur: <br> “Always and when the capitalist mode of production dominates on a world scale, it is the anarchy of <br> capitalist production to which the fundamental changes in the material sphere, the <br> changes that determine the milestone for class struggle. ” (Lotta, 2014) 147 <br> The Maoist Organization of Colombia, MLM's proletarian power-organization, in one of its <br> Interventions in the fight of two lines in 2022, around the discussion base for CIMU, unmasked <br> Commitly this Avakianist philosophical falsification and its ideological-political decorrences. In your <br> document turning off with the Avakianist opportunism we are forging the unit among the communists, if <br> says: <br> “In the discourse of the supposed main form of movement of the fundamental contradiction, Avakian left <br> from outside the monopoly and its effects on free trade and, therefore, its effects on its own <br> anarchy." (PP-OP-MLM) 148 <br> And after citing an important passage in which Lenin describes the transformation of free competition into <br> Monopoly, concludes: <br> “This is what is 'converted to our eyes' (ie, covered by evidence), it cannot be <br> unknown. Has implied that, for much of the planet, when the impositions of the <br> imperialism (monopolies) move free competition, anarchy is not the driving force <br> the development of productive forces or other contradictions. ” (PP-OP-MLM) 149 <br> This is one of the main falsified points by Avakian, treats the effect of production anarchy on <br> productive forces and production relations as if there were no difference between the capitalism of the <br> nineteenth century and its imperialist phase. <br> Faced with this bourgeois philosophical basis, after these great falsifications of Marxism, Avakian & Cia only <br> It could elaborate a capitalist strategy - in accordance with its imperial theory. If the conditions <br><br><br> for the revolution are created by competition between capitalists and the interimperialist contradictions, which <br> It remains to the communists, the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples and nations is to wait for these <br> Conditions are mature and then… make the revolution. While propagating your antimarxist theses- <br> Leninist-Maoist and utters his following attacks on the giants of the international proletariat, remains to Avakian <br> launch your audicious consign: <br> "Accelerate while awaiting the emergence of a revolutionary situation." (AVAKIAN, 2019) 150 <br> Avakianist capitulationism in the twentieth century and its chiefs baptized “new synthesis” is already in itself <br> too evident. What matters here is to demonstrate how these positions are anchored in counterfeits <br> philosophical from the early 1980s. What matters is to demonstrate the counterfeiting philosophical content <br> Marxism behind the alleged defense of the law of contradiction and the principle that one is divided into two, <br> source in which some organizations and their leaders have drunk to be bound. This is the most important question <br> to unveil in this topic. Taking down falsifications, it becomes easier to locate bourgeois content <br> Reactionary of Avakianist philosophy; its relativistic essence and its application, from the revisionist principle of <br> Integrate two in one. Avakian applies the same integration of two conform a pacchandist, but does it for <br> A different way. As a prachanda openly predicates the reconciliation of contradictions, Avakian applies to <br> absolute identity of the opposites, covered by a “leftist” discourse (in the early years of <br> 1980). <br> Thus, as the revisionist Bogdanov, applauded in his idealistic positions by Lenin in materialism and <br> Empiriocriticism, established an absolute, metaphysical, non -dialectical identity between being social and <br> social awareness, Avakian establishes an absolute identity between external conditions and contradictions <br> internal and between theory and practice. Evident that this absolute identity is not in an equal proportion,<br>but as a statement of external conditions and suppression of internal contradictions and affirmation of theory <br> and suppression of practice. Just as the conception of Yang Sien-chos eliminated the struggle of contrary through <br> the reconciliation of contradictions, the absolute identity of Avakian eliminates the struggle of the opposites from the <br> disregard of the aspect of the contradiction that represents the new, that is, eliminates the revolutionary practice of <br> their unity with theory, artificially eliminates the internal contradictions of a country as the base of the <br> revolutionary transformation of this country to take external conditions as the determinants for said <br> process. <br> In its “scientific epistemology” Avakian completely suppresses practice. The result of your identity <br> absolute between theory and practice appears when he states that: <br> “(…) It is important to see that it is practice in the broader sense.” (AVAKIAN, 2008) 151 <br> That is, the practice without risks of the concrete practice of class struggle, the theoretical practice of cabinet, the <br> Chair, completely removed from the masses and the concreteness of the class struggle. Thus, Avakian claims to be <br> possible to develop the revolutionary theory divorced from the revolutionary struggle and denies the active role of <br> Masses on the drive and forge of its scientific ideology. Avakian's conception of science is the <br> bourgeois conception about the truth. The Marxist theory of knowledge, the movement of practice - theory - <br> Practice, from the masses to the pasta, for him is but a “populist epistemology”: <br> “This general notion of populism and populist epistemology in an important degree has achieved <br> penetrate and, in a few ways, added the communist movement and its need to be <br> scientific." (AVAKIAN, 2019) 152 <br> Yang Sien-chin, philosopher of Liu Shao-Chi, defended reconciliation between the opposite aspects: red and <br> experts, aiming to clearly promote the specialty over the detriment of the party and militant <br> revolutionary of the workers. Avakian promotes the same bourgeois and reactionary conception: <br> “All this is closely related to what it says in the 'sketch' about the new synthesis:‘ <br> Epistemology and partidism. In the relationship between being scientific and being partisan, the main thing is to be <br> systematically scientific '. (AVAKIAN, 2019) 153 <br> Avakian is a longtime revisionist, an inveterate counterfeiter, cowardly capitulating. A <br> characterization of the UOC (MLM) of Avakianism as centrism aims only to hide the tracks of its ancient <br><br><br> Ideological affiliation, camouflage the origin of a significant part of its theoretical principles. It was Avakian who <br> inaugurated the revisionist modality that acted in MRI, thus opening the bite of philosophical falsifications <br> later followed by pacchanda. Avakianism did not prosper in the 1980s, as the presence of <br> TKP/ML at the 1984 Conference and the later ticket of the PCP, sustained by the tremendous theoretical advances <br> Practical and ideological-political from the Popular War in Peru, played Avakian to a defensive position. <br> For years he was forced to dance the song that the left there played. After the fall of President Gonzalo, <br> Avakian raises his head in his most harmful actions: 1st) Articulates, in 1994, an international campaign of <br> President Gonzalo's defamation, who resulted in the demobilization of the international campaign in defense <br> of the life of the PCP leader; 2) Articulated shamefully, in 1998, the expulsion of MRI's TKP/ML. <br> After that it suffers an important defeat at Comri with the Millennium Declaration in 2000, but this victory <br> From the left it was just circumstantial. As soon as prachandism becomes openly revisionism, <br> markedly at the II National Conference of PCN (M), in February 2001, Avakian and Pachanda <br> dance together the waltz of capitulation. In 2005 they divorce, but continue to commune the same ideology <br> revisionist and the same bourgeois philosophy. <br> 2.2- Prachandism as a practical realization of Avakianist speculation <br> When in November 2006, Pachanda signed the nefano “Global Peace Agreement” agreeing with the <br> aquartering and disarmament of the popular liberation army, its capitulation became wide open <br> revisionist. At that time, essence and appearance coincided in the pacchandist position and it was not necessary <br> Lots of science to identify prachandist revisionism. Despite this, many organizations and parties <br> inside the MRI followed for a few years defending the Pachanda's capitulatory line as <br> If this were a non -dogmatic application of Maoism. In 2008, when Pachanda already as first- <br> Minister of Nepal advised his newest invention, the mediocre and ahistoric "(...) joint dictatorship of the <br> proletariat and bourgeoisie ”154, the PCM of Italy, for example, declared: <br> “The balance of the experience of the international communist movement and socialism, the battle for <br> revolution in the 21st century, had an important first appreciation, as it is based on the real advance of<br>Nepalese revolution and theoretical contributions, practices and policies to Marxist-Leninist science <br> Maoists brought by the Communist Party of Nepal and the comrade Prachanda. ” (PCM da <br> Italy, 2008) 155 <br> Instead of self -criticism because they have given international support and support to management positions <br> pacchandist, many of these organizations have their responsibility and seek to present the <br> Pachanda capitulation as something “surprising” and “unexpected”. Thus seek to separate the positions <br> pacchandists from 2006 of their previous formulations, during the early years of the war <br> Popular. Positions like these cover the bourgeois philosophical foundations of the Pachanda position and not <br> Thus, it goes out or break with the pernostic influence of this revisionist modality. Like this <br> Avakian begins his philosophical falsifications in the early 1980s, seeking to create a theoretical basis that <br> Justifying its capitulating revisionism, Pachanda begins, in February 2001, already apparently, <br> In the II National Conference of PCN (M), the same process. It is in this conference that the so -called <br> “Prachanda Way”, which is born as a revisionist modality, although it still covered with a <br> Left phraseology. <br> These pacchandist positions were not covered by the PCN (M), on the contrary, since 2001 <br> widely publicized by its propaganda agencies: the Maoist International Bulletin, The Magazine <br> Worker and interviews of the renegade Prachanda for international press and communication monopolies. <br> The parties and Maoist organizations that the time did not realize this turn to the right of the direction of the <br> PCN (m) or were very inattentive deluded with appearances, or converged with positions <br> Prachandist ideological. In one case or another, they should self-criticize and rectify their positions. The critic <br> To philosophical falsifications, this ideological capitulation of pacchandism in the early 2000s is decisive <br> to go deep in the rectification of these positions. Possive in criticism of the deposition of weapons by the EPL <br> custody by the UN, the formulations of “globalized imperialist state”, “competition <br> Multipartisan ”, finally, of“ 21st century socialism ”is only in the shell of the capitulatory position <br> without giving up its essence. <br><br><br> Like every revisionist position, Prachandismo was the expression of capitulationism in the direction of the process <br> Nepalese revolutionary. Not of capitulation in the face of a defeat, but of capitulation in the face of the great <br> Challenges that the advance of the revolution presented towards him. The advance of the Nepalesa Revolution gave <br> Starks for the beginning of a new phase of the New Democracy Revolution; Given the imminent fall <br> of reactionary monarchy, Yankee imperialism, social-imperialism and Indian expansionism, <br> each other prepared a military intervention that would make it possible to curb the extraordinary advancement <br> of the popular war. It is in these circumstances that Prachanda capitulates shamefully, justifying this betrayal <br> the Nepalese revolution and nation in the following terms: <br> “It is a geographical fact that our country, with only 25 million inhabitants, is compressed between <br> Two giant countries, India and China, each with more than one billion inhabitants. The military force <br> Chinese develops to counteract US imperialism. The Indian Army is the fourth <br> strongest in the world. With the resources we have in our country and with the strength of our EPL, to <br> defend our geographical integrity against foreign military aggression, even though we recruit <br> all young people in it, we cannot think of defeating any of the neighboring armies without speaking <br> of the US imperialist army. ” (PRACHANDA, 2006) 156 <br> This is the testament of a revisionist in his attempt to justify his covered capitulation <br> Opportunistic “realism”. Throws the whole experience of the International Communist Movement, <br> National liberation movement, which in the course of the twentieth century gave numerous evidence that the masses <br> led by the Communist Party, through the People's War, can defeat any enemy: the <br> Imperialism is a paper tiger. Today, the Palestinian people give the most current and heroic test, that even <br> surrounded by a genocidal imperialist state, such as Israel, compressed in a narrow strip of, <br> On average, only 9 km wide by 40 km long, consisting of just over 2 million <br> inhabitants, in the struggle of resistance and national liberation, can defeat imperialist domination when <br> a consequent direction that drives a war of prolonged masses, even though this direction <br> Not armed by the scientific ideology of the proletariat. The shameful capitulation of Pachanda is so <br> Patent that only revisionist betrayal can justify.<br>The direction of UOC (MLM) echoing the Trotskyists of Avakianism analyzed the capitulation of pacchanda in <br> following terms: <br> “Since a long time, there has always been a fight in MCI between Marxism and the adapted opportunism <br> bourgeois nationalism, and between MCI and the nationalist propensity of the democratic movement <br> Small Burger to the National Liberation struggle divorced from the class struggle, or on colorful occasions <br> of small-bourgeois socialism and, in any case, alien and opposite both the covenant with the struggle of <br> Classes for the Socialist Revolution, regarding the direction of the proletariat. In the background, the same content as <br> Current struggle between Marxism and Prachandismo ”. [UOC (MLM)] 157 <br> Prachandism was not characterized by a nationalist deviation, on the contrary pachanda capitula <br> precisely the national liberation struggle; Capitula of advancing the popular war for its national phase <br> Revolutionary, capitulates the revolution of new democracy for its national liberation phase. <br> Capitulates and betrays the nation and people, the proletariat with a more advanced part of this and the proletariat <br> international, to fraternize with Yankee imperialism, social-imperialism and the <br> Indian expansionism, exchanging Nepalese national liberation for a plate of lentils. There is nothing <br> nationalism in this position. <br> The ideological expression of the pacchandist capitulation appears explicitly in the document Great Leap <br> Front, Resolution of the II National Conference of PCN (M), 2001, when Pachanda hugs <br> shamelessly the Avakianist balance of MCI. Although there are many concessions on the left in this <br> document, prachanda openly highlights that: <br> “The documents and articles written and prepared by PCR-UUS and its President Bob Avakian <br> They fulfilled an important role in raising the debate to a new level. ” (PRACHANDA, 2001) 158 <br> And pachanda in this document, clarifies what the new level would consist of by the renegade Avakian: <br> “At this time, revolutionaries around the world are free, without any political pressure, <br> to extract the essence of the experiences of history and a great responsibility is placed on <br><br><br> your shoulders (…). In this context, we must deepen what was mentioned well initially in the <br> Letter entitled Stalin issue, during the big debate released by the CCP, led by Mao <br> against Kruschov's revisionism. ” (PRACHANDA, 2001) 159 <br> The “deepening” of Pachanda's critique of Stalin is nothing more than the repetition of the arguments of <br> Avakian at the beginning of the 1980s: <br> “The emphasis on the defense of the Soviet society of an external threat, undermined the <br> internationalism and exaggerated Russian nationalism, which created many confusions in understanding <br> of the advance of the World Revolution and on the functioning of the Communist International. ” (PRACHANDA, <br> 2001) 160 <br> The same Avakianist litany about a supposed nationalist trend also in Stalin and MCI. A <br> Avakian's same strategy to start the ideological attack on Marxism attacking Stalin and then denying <br> all the essence of the ideology of the international proletariat. The “freedom” announced by Prachanda in 2001, <br> to “deepen” the criticism of comrade Stalin resulted in 2005 in the public announcement of the abandonment of the <br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism: <br> “The attention of 21st century proletarian revolutionaries must be focused entirely on the fact that <br> that the analysis that Lenin and Mao made of imperialism and a number of concepts that <br> They developed on this basis, related to the proletarian strategy, became obsolete. ” (PRACHANDA, <br> 2005) 161 <br> Converging completely with Avakian's ideological balance about MCI, Prachandism since 2001 <br> He became converted from the practical expression of Avakianist speculation. Thus, the “much elasticity” of this <br> Avakian's “hard core” presents herself as a “multi -party competition” of Pachanda. The “new synthesis” <br> Avakianist presents itself as “21st century socialism” of Pachanda. The thesis of production anarchy <br> as a dynamic element in Avakian's imperialism, applied by pachandism presents itself as the theory <br> of the globalized imperialist state. The Avakianist Barafunda who converts the international situation into causes <br> internal for the development of the revolution in a given country presented itself as the justification <br> Prachanda ideological for the capitulation of the popular war in the country. <br> And this manifestation of Avakianist theory as a prachandist practice was not only in 2006, but <br> since 2001. The overestimation of the strength of Yankee imperialism, so pronounced in the will <br> Prachanda capitulationist, it already appears in the II CN of PCN (M), in 2001: <br> “Mainly USA imperialism, greater and more encouraged to accumulate unlimited profits <br> through the combination of unprecedented progress in science and technology, including <br> electronics, with the cheap work of the Third World. ” (PRACHANDA, 2001) 162<br>Beyond the apology to the imperialism of the supposed progressive role of anarchy of social production in the <br> Imperialism, Pachanda repeats the Avakianist mantra about the “globalization of the production process”: <br> “With the process of globalization to appropriate profits, development unprecedented in the <br> field of information technology, mainly electronic, reduced the whole world to a single <br> and small rural unit. ” (PRACHANDA, 2001) 163 <br> All this apology to imperialism was made to present the false assessment that the international situation <br> In the first decade of the 21st century it was very unfavorable for the World Revolution. This is the evaluation <br> Avakian's trumped, especially after the events of September 11. Unlike this <br> Balance, the September 11 machine was the Yankee reaction to the decline of the offensive <br> counterrevolutionary general character of imperialism and the whole reaction, triggered in the second half <br> of the 1980s, whose peak was reached from 1992 to 1996. This offensive counterrevolutionary <br> General pointed against Marxism with the harmful action of revisionism and social-imperialism Russians <br> (which then outlined), decreed the death of communism and even the end of history, <br> liquidated the Potsdam system with the sharing of Eastern Europe and the spheres of influence in the rest of the <br> world, all wrapped in the false slogans of “neoliberalism” and “globalization” and established the <br> Unique hegemonic superpower condition of Yankee imperialism. But, contrary to what I estimated <br> The whole reaction, the disorder in the world only increased. Extreme nationalisms aroused as well as the <br><br><br> fascism, ethnic and prey wars driven by imperialism by the sharing and recruudation of the <br> class struggle and national liberation, without giving up the expected growth and stability of the economy <br> worldwide. September 11 was the Yankee Machination to create public opinion without which <br> resume the offensive counterrevolutionary, as followed, with the occupation of Afghanistan by the coalition <br> commanded by the Yankee and logo from Iraq. And this offensive resumption was not based on a period of <br> expansion or recomposition of the profit rate of imperialism as a whole, but based on a <br> profound economic crisis, the same one that continues to get worse without ceasing to the present day, at levels without <br> Precedents of the decomposition of monopolistic capital. The most apparent manifestation than already occurred in the <br> objective base of the time occurred with the real estate crisis and derivatives in the USA, in late 2007 and beginning of <br> 2008, the largest crisis of the postwar Yankee financial system that has become widespread around the world, <br> thus unmasking all the apologetic analysis of the imperialism of the Avakian and Prachanda. <br> The situation of Nepalese renegade, in turn, required a little more juggling. Because, next to the supposed <br> unfavorable international situation existed a formidable national situation that placed the PCN (m) <br> eve, not the conquest of power across the country, but from the advance to the stage of the National War <br> revolutionary that would carry the proletariat, the peasants and the Nepalese people as a whole their liberation <br> national, raising internationalist support around the world and raising tension in the class struggle <br> in India as in China social-imperialist. To maneuver in this conjuncture, the pacchandists give use <br> precisely from the Avakianist-Trotskyist precept that the international situation constitutes the main cause of the <br> advance or backwardness of the revolution in a given country. Thus, if the international situation was not <br> Favorable was justified the capitulation and delay of the Nepalese revolution, to expect a “conjuncture” <br> favorable on a world scale. Prachanda thus applied the Avakianist “watchword”: accelerate while <br> Wait. Accelerated the capitulation of the popular war while “waiting” the decant favorable situation <br> Worldwide, which for these masters, only a new world war can realize it. This position appears like that <br> formulated by directo Bhattarai when analyzing the resolution of the PCN CC (M) meeting in <br> September/October 2005: <br> “The resolution made an objective assessment of the globalized imperialism today and advanced the <br> conception that only taking the world initiative of the revolution in the new context is that the <br> Revolution in a given country can be achieved and defended. ” (Bhattarai) 164 <br> The practical application of Avakianism to a concrete revolutionary process could only be the most <br> shameful of a revolution. The differences, expressed between PCR-UUS and PCN (m) in the correspondences <br> exchanged between 2005 and 2008, represent only the contradiction between revisionist speculation and its <br> Practical application. While in the world of ideas, revisionism can appear something of contestation, already<br>led to the 'practice of a given country' reveals entirely its dark, conservative and reactionary essence. <br> Capitulation and pacchandist revisionism is the same as Avakianism, both in content and form. To the <br> Philosophical falsifications have different shades but keep the same essence: bourgeois philosophy <br> metaphysics and idealistic. These philosophical falsifications of prachanda are prior to 2001 and revealing about <br> its ideological trajectory, which reiterates once again the importance of philosophical struggle for development <br> From the two -line struggle, to the strengthening of the left and applauding from the right. <br> Contrary to what UOC (MLM) states for its militancy, a long time ago Prachanda defends and applies to <br> “Law of denial of denial”. Still, in 1991, before the beginning of the popular war, Pachanda defines <br> following the Marxist philosophy: <br> “The materialistic dialectic, the conception of the world of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, considers the <br> absolute character of the struggle, prevailing even in the relative unity of the opposites of the matter, <br> considering it as the factor that causes the growth and destruction of every incident of nature, <br> society and human thinking. The dialectic of the evolution of every thing and event that are <br> interrelated and the dynamic flow of continuous changes, as Lenin says, is not a line <br> simple and straight, but it happens in the form of a sequence of continuity ruptures, jumps, <br> calamities and revolution, transformation of quantity into quality, and denial of denial. It is <br> It is the scientific essence of Marxist dialectic about development. ” (PRACHANDA, 1991) 165 <br><br><br> As we study the great philosophical controversy in the CCP, the falsification is more evident <br> pacchandist, because the highest synthesis of the law of established contradiction, under the direction of President Mao, <br> On the eve of GRCP, the unity of opposites such as the heart of materialistic dialectic, which all <br> contradiction is resolved through the principle that one is divided into two, that the resolution of every contradiction <br> advances the quantitative changes to qualitative changes, and the affirmation of a certain unit of <br> contrary to its dominant aspect to the denial of this unit by its dominated aspect. This synthesis <br> philosophical, as mentioned, resolves the question posed by Engels about the interconnection between the then <br> Three basic laws of dialectic. <br> Prachanda falsifies this issue, replaces the affirmation and denial, repressing the denial of denial, as <br> Essential and absolute element of Marxist dialectic. In addition, in this same initial document a subtle, <br> but pernostic, falsification of the principle that one is divided into two: <br> “Deep analysis and application of the question that one is divided into two as the main aspect of <br> Dialectics during the anti-revisionist struggle, it made available to the revolutionaries a sharp weapon <br> to fight against revisionism. ” (PRACHANDA, 1991) 166 <br> In this Prachanda formulation presents the principle that one is divided into two as an aspect of the <br> dialectic. What would be the other aspect? In the 1990s texts, he does not say what this would be, but this <br> Inaccuracy left the door open to the following falsifications. In the 2000s, Prachanda presents <br> Way also covered which, in your conception, would be the other aspect of dialectic: <br> “The process of applying the wisest lesson of GRCP that 'one is divided into two' and the unit- <br> struggle-transformation of opposites, has led to the development of a unique wealth in the form of <br> continuous development and establishment of a revolutionary current within the party <br> On the basis of a broad democracy, defeating all sorts of non -proletarian trends. ” <br> (PRACHANDA, 2000) 167 <br> We saw in detail that the wisest philosophical lesson on the eve of GRCP was precisely that: <br> “One is divided into two is a form of complete, scientific and popular expression of the Unit of <br> contrary. This means that everything in the world (including nature, human society and <br> human thinking) is one that divides into two. ” (JAO CHING-HUANG) 168 <br> Prachanda's reasons for replacing the affirmation and denial with denial of denial, within the law of <br> contradiction, and to put alongside the principle of whom one is divided into two the consign of unit unit <br> Transformation was not in vain. All of these are philosophical formulations that intentionally distort the <br> Dialectical materialism aimed at giving him an opposite content imperceptibly and subreptiously. A <br> intention behind the “subtle” for the pacchandist was the same as Liu Shao-Chi and Yang Sien-chos: join <br> alongside the revolutionary principle that one is divided into two the bourgeois and conciliatory principle that <br> Two combine in one. Like Yang Sien-chos, Pachanda advances in this regard initially <br> non -antagonistic contradictions, or contradictory aspects in which one fights to achieve a<br>relative balance between both. Let's see: <br> “To the extent that the popular war was advancing this distinctive understanding developed and <br> refined. Through the victorious implementation of the fifth plan of the Popular War this understanding of the <br> Party manifested itself in the particular form of balance between political attack and military attack, <br> balance between local and central intervention, balance between popular war and mass movement, <br> balance between main force and secondary force, balance between main and zones <br> secondary, balance between centralization and decentralization, balance between initiative <br> independent and tactical alliance, between dialogue and coordination, balance between local and center, balance <br> between internal and external activities to the country, balance between class struggle and fighting two lines, etc., and <br> development of the tactical level of principles and then the emergence of party guide thinking. ” <br> (PRACHANDA, 2000) 169 <br> The emergence of the Pachanda Way is announced as the result of the balance between the aspects <br> contradictory. At no time does it stand out that any relative balance can only be achieved <br> through the struggle and that throughout the contradiction, even in relative balance, the most aspect must predominate <br> Advanced, for only then can contradiction be resolved in a revolutionary manner. <br><br><br> The next step of Prachandism was to present his rotten “fusion theory” in II CN in 2001. Thus <br> Like revisionist Yang Sien-chun, Prachanda initially presents the "fusion" of contradictions <br> directly related to class antagonism: <br> “There is a significant change in the concept prevailing the revolution model after the <br> 80's. Today, a new merger of strategies of the armed insurrection with the Popular War and the <br> Prolonged popular war with armed insurrection has been imperative. Without similar merger, a <br> genuine revolution is impossible in any country in the world today. ” (PRACHANDA, 2001) 170 <br> In this way, neither philosophical falsification nor its contents are evident. Because it looks <br> Relatively logical the need to combine prolonged popular war with the insurrection; In fact, this is <br> something already implicit in the military theory of the proletariat established by President Mao, after all the offensive <br> strategic corresponds to the completion of the city's siege by the countryside and taken from large cities <br> by its insurrection survey from within. This Maoist principle was also <br> brilliantly developed and applied by President Gonzalo, with his contribution to the “Popular War <br> Unit ”Main Field and City Complement City. PRACHANDA presents the theory of fusion <br> Initially with left colors precisely to hide its capitulatory political content. <br> The supposed armed insurrection contained in the theory of pacchandist fusion was nothing more than haste <br> capitalist to close an agreement with sectors of the ruling classes and imperialism, denying <br> Thus the indispensable phase in the popular war in the colonial countries which is the revolutionary national war. <br> Behind the altissonating consign of armed insurrection was sheltering the directive proposition of the conformation <br> of a constituent assembly with the reactionary parliamentary parties, the denial of <br> Revolution of new democracy and the revolutionary dictatorship of workers and peasants. Fusion theory <br> between popular war and insurrection, it aimed to hide its political content: “joint dictatorship of the proletariat <br> and the bourgeoisie ”. And this was already evident in the content of the resolutions of the II CN of the PCN (M): <br> “From a tactical point of view, the policies of centralized attacks against the main enemy, continuing <br> party policy for negotiations, emphasizing the tactical development of the united front etc., <br> will be maintained. But this alone will not be enough to achieve the strategic objectives above <br> mentioned. For our party to move forward, a planned path is necessary on the following <br> Subjects: Organize a conference of all the political forces in which they participate through <br> representatives all parties and popular organizations in the country, elect an interim government in this <br> conference and guarantee the construction of a constitution by the people under the election of this government <br> interim elected. The Central Committee will develop a concrete program and a plan for its initiation. <br> The sketch of this plan will incorporate the tactic of the general insurrection in the prolonged popular war. ” <br> (PRACHANDA, 2001) 171 <br> To say that the prachandist capitulation, in 2005 and 2006, was surprising is an unleashed lie. O <br> Capitulation plan was already sketched in the II CN of the PCN (M). The political content of the fusion theory of <br> popular war with the insurrection was already given in the proposition of the creation of an interim government from<br>a conference with all the reactionary parties of the country. That is, the theory of pachandist fusion, since the <br> Beginning was just the most blatant bourgeois philosophy to integrate two into one. <br> The conciliatory content of the theory of fusion, the balance between the aspects of a contradiction and the denial <br> Prachandist denial was also evidenced in the resolutions of the II CN of the PCN (M). The content of <br> integrate two in one appears clearly when Prachanda analyzes the process of the communist movement <br> in Nepal: <br> “Finally, while we systematize the Nepalese communist movement, it is possible to say that this <br> march below forging a new unit on a new base according to the dialectical principle <br> of the unit-unit-transformation or thesis-antithesis-synthesis. The foundation of the party, its manifesto <br> Preliminary, politics and program were the unit or thesis. In the development process, several <br> trends, internal conflicts, ups and downs, divisions and factions were the fight or antithesis in <br> Nepalese communist movement. The Great Popular War led by the PCN (M) during the last <br> five years is a manifestation of transformation and synthesis or a new unit in a new <br> base. The whole process of the Nepalese communist movement can also be seen as a <br> denial of denial. The correct party policy was denied by revisionism and then the <br><br><br> revisionism for the correct revolutionary politics and, finally the great process of the popular war <br> emerged." (PRACHANDA, 2001) 172 <br> By presenting the unit-unit-transformation as a thesis-antithesis-synthesis, Pachanda makes the typical movement <br> Revisionist: separates the struggle from unity, separates the struggle from transformation, then make the fight the relative <br> and from unity the absolute in the contradiction. The fight appears only at the most negative moment of the movement <br> Nepalese communist, of his dispersion, the predominance of small and conspiracy conceptions. A <br> struggle is opposed to the transformation, so much so that it is achieved in the congress of unity, which establishes the base of the <br> Transformation, of synthesis. In relation to the denial of denial the sense given by pacchanda is the same given <br> Proudhon: an advance that is at the same time a setback, that is, a combination between the right and the <br> wrong. The party's degeneration in revisionist is presented by Prachanda as the first denial, <br> Thus, revisionism appears as the new and necessary aspect for party development. For <br> Prachanda The revolutionary line can only advance in alliance with revisionist positions. <br> This appears even more explicit when Prachanda systematizes the “method for the development of <br> Broken": <br> “This ideological struggle is linked to the struggle against metaphysical thinking that <br> fractionist leads to the pretext of monolithic unity, rather than the dialectical method of <br> Party development through the opposing unit and the struggle of two lines. ” <br> (PRACHANDA, 2001) 173 <br> There is only one method and conception for party development: the struggle of two lines. The unit of <br> contrary is not a method that stands next to the two -line struggle; After all, the fight of two lines <br> part of party recognition as a contradiction and constitutes the only way to solve this <br> contradiction with the purpose that the left predominates. Therefore there is no method of uniting opposites <br> in the party, seeking to live with the party with revisionism, this is just the rotten theory of integrating <br> Two in one. <br> Prachanda reissues Yang Sien-chin's philosophical falsification just using new words. In 2006, <br> thus defines the law of contradiction: <br> “Dialectical and historical materialism is the philosophy of revolution; not only applies to society but that <br> also to human thinking. Unity and the struggle of contrary constitute its fundamental law. <br> Means that each entity is divided into two, and that each of the aspects becomes its <br> contrary. In our view, the second is the main aspect for us communists. ” (PRACHANDA, 2006) 174 <br> Here Prachanda separates the division of unity into two of the mutual transformation of the aspects. It presents, <br> Therefore, the principle that one is divided into two only as the beginning of contradiction and not as its <br> resolution. As we could see in detail in the study of the great philosophical controversy, this was precisely the <br> argument of the revisionists, that the movement of contradiction began with one dividing in two, <br> but its resolution was through that two combine in one. Analysis as one is divided into two <br> and the synthesis as an integration of two into one. The theory of pachandist fusion is nothing more than <br> Redition of the rotten revisionist philosophy of Liu Shao-Chi and Yan Sien-chos. Already in the 60s, the Maoist Line <br> It had unmasked another essentially identical variant of the theory of fusion: <br> “If we act in accordance with Yang Sien-chos [Prachanda] and the point of view of others<br>comrades [bhattarai] of integrating two into one, this will only lead us to the merger of contradictions and <br> reconciliation of the struggle, and we would be fundamentally unable to achieve the objectives <br> revolutionaries. This is precisely the point of view that modern revisionism gives wide <br> advertising." (Fasi Fa-Fu, Chia Ku-Lin and Others) 175 <br> Prachanda's philosophical falsification is identical to Yang Sien-chos, Prachanda is nothing more than Liu <br> Shao-Chi Nepalese. Sooner than late, it will be swept by the Nepalese masses that, directed by its <br> Vanguard, they will resume the path of prolonged popular war and the revolution of new democracy. <br> The revisionist theory of merger must be differentiated, which takes it as the conciliation of contradictions or as <br> Its absolute identity of the objective, natural and social process of fusion. Not every fusion implies the <br><br><br> “Integration of two in one” or the reconciliation of contradictions. For example, when Lenin unfurled <br> need to merge revolutionary national wars with the proletariat war against the bourgeoisie, <br> It is evident that it is not denying the differentiation between the struggle of the international proletariat and the struggle <br> Democratic of national liberation, but just as one develops in the other. The direction of the PCC- <br> FR Formulates this question in a very accurate question in its answer to UOC (MLM) in 2022, let's see: <br> “Given this planting, UOC comrades vehemently point out that it is a great <br> misconception attributing to Lenin the detestable theory of the fusion of the class struggle of the proletariat with the struggle <br> national'. <br> Without referring to what the comrades call “theory of the fusion of class struggle and the national struggle”, <br> let us see if it is right or not that Lenin has defined the merger of the two major currents or forces of the <br> World Revolution and for this what is better than quoting Lenin's words: <br> ‘The Socialist Revolution will not be unique and especially a struggle of the revolutionary proletarians of <br> Each country against its bourgeoisie; No, it will be a struggle of all colonies and all the countries overwhelmed <br> by imperialism, of all dependent countries, against international imperialism. In the program <br> of our party, adopted in March of the current year, we say, when characterizing the approach of <br> social revolution worldwide, that the civil war of workers against imperialists and <br> explorers in all advanced countries begin to merge with the National War against <br> International imperialism. This confirms the march of the revolution and will see more and more <br> confirmed. The same will pass in the East. '* <br> From this we can say that it is not a 'great misconception' of the Coordinating Committee proposal <br> By referring to Lenin this 'obnoxious' theory. That it is not certain that Lenin has always denounced this 'fusion' <br> as a 'fatal error' for the proletarian revolution and that, far from being 'obnoxious' <br> integral part of the grandiose program and today constitutes an invaluable and current <br> guidance on the strategic world proletarian revolution, later developed by the <br> President Mao. <br> A few years later, in 1921, at the milestone of the III Congress of the Communist International, Lenin returns to <br> defend this idea in another way: <br> ‘World imperialism must fall when the revolutionary impulse of exploited workers and <br> oppressed in each country, overcoming the resistance of the breakfast elements and the influence of <br> insignificant elite constituted by the working aristocracy merges with the revolutionary impulse of <br> millions of beings that had so far remained on the fringes of history, for which <br> They constituted more than a patient subject. <br> Even if we see in the military program of the proletarian revolution, written in 1916, this definition of <br> strategy of the world proletarian revolution to sweep imperialism and the reaction of the face of the earth, is <br> even clearer and clearer, as it shows that the path of the two forces cannot be other than <br> revolutionary wars and their fusion. <br> ‘From the theoretical point of view it would be totally erroneous to doubt that every war is no more than the <br> continuation of politics by other means. The current imperialist war is the continuation of politics <br> imperialist of the two groups of great powers, and this policy is originated and nourished by the whole <br> of the relations of the imperialist time. But this same time will originate and nourish too, <br> inevitably, the policy of the struggle against national oppression and the struggle of the proletariat against the <br> bourgeoisie and, therefore, the possibility and inevitability, first of all, the insurrections <br> and revolutionary national wars; secondly, from the wars of the proletariat against <br> bourgeoisie; Third, the fusion of the two types of revolutionary wars, etc. ”. (PCC-FR) 176 <br> The merger defended by Lenin corresponds to that the movement of the international proletariat present in all<br>World, direct the national liberation movement of colonial and semicolonial countries. In this unit of <br> contrary to the main aspect, which should therefore predominate is the proletarian direction, which is also <br> The socialist revolution in imperialist countries is the only one capable of leading to the full victory of wars <br> revolutionary nationals and their uninterrupted passage to the socialist revolution. The direction of UOC (MLM) does not <br> is opposed to the principle of “integrating two in one”, but denies the need to be planted by Lenin do <br> * Inform at the II Congress of All Russia of the Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East, 1919. <br><br><br> decisive role of revolutionary national wars, under the direction of the proletariat, to the triumph of <br> World proletarian revolution. <br> 2.3- The convergence of UOC (MLM) with the revisionist principle of integrating two in a <br> Avakian and Prachanda make a shamefully capitulating MCI balance of MCI, in general, and <br> Experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the twentieth century, in particular. UOC (mlm) converges, essentially, <br> With this balance, starting with the attacks on the comrade Stalin called by Pachanda in 2001. <br> UOC (MLM) In this way it analyzes the glorious experience of proletariat dictatorship in the USSR: <br> “The errors of the Russian communists and Stalin in particular (…) [derive] fundamentally from change <br> heading in the construction of the new type of state: the Soviets, of a permanent and unique base of the entire <br> State power ', became mere transmission belts and ended up converted into a <br> apparatus identical to the bourgeois parliament. In 1936 the Soviet Constitution (the 'rule of law' <br> who complain Prachanda and Avakian and all the small bourgeois) formalized the spoil of the whole <br> Soviet power and converted them into a mere parliamentary instrument; that is, adopted, in <br> essence, the same form of the bourgeois parliamentary state, where the masses do not participate or <br> decide on public affairs, where state bureaucratic and military forces are separated <br> of the masses, over society and against it ”. [UOC (MLM), 2008] 177 <br> And after launching this typically Trotskyist nonsense against the dictatorship of the proletariat in the USSR, they <br> following ideological balance about the set of experiences of socialist states in the twentieth century: <br> “The critical analysis of the experience of the proletariat in power makes it clear (…) that did not work for <br> that the old class of class domination would be extinguished and in this sense the communist movement <br> succumbed to the superstitious faith in the state criticized by Marx and Engels and the idea kautskysta was imposed on this <br> respect. In practice, Kautsky won the battle in both Russia and China. ” [UOC (MLM), <br> 2008] 178 <br> They conclude that in the experience of the dictatorship of the USSR proletariat under the direction of Stalin and China <br> Under the direction of President Mao, he predominated the Kautskista conception of the state. State, that the <br> Soviets, in the 1930s, became a bourgeois parliamentary instrument and the Red Army <br> He placed separately from the masses, above these and against them. The defeat of the Naziascist invasion of the USSR, under the <br> Marshal Stalin Command, is the full proof of the falsehood of these revisionist attacks. UOC (mlm) only <br> Repeats Avakian's old Cantilena that: <br> “The Soviet Union participated in World War II based on a patriotic position, that is, <br> democratic-bourgeois. ” (AVAKIAN, 1981) 179 <br> There is no difference between this Avakian balance and the aforementioned UOC conclusion that: <br> “Since a long time, there has always been a fight in MCI between Marxism and the adapted opportunism <br> to bourgeois nationalism ”. [UOC (MLM)] 180 <br> Regarding the experiences of the dictatorship of the proletariat, UOC (MLM) reaches the height of highlighting the commune <br> of Paris as the most advanced experience, typically small-bourgeois balance convergent <br> Prachanda and Bhattarai positions: <br> “The dictatorship of the proletariat is a requirement derived from the content of the new social relations of <br> production. Therefore, the socialist content of these relationships requires a new form of state: the state <br> Paris Commune Type. ” [UOC (MLM)] 181 <br> The glorious commune of Paris, did not have time to develop new social relations of production, <br> heroically outlined the content of the proletarian state, but in no way can it be <br> considered the typical model of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a false defense of the Paris Commune, which <br> It aims exclusively to conceal the capitalist balance that make socialist experience in the twentieth century. <br> The proletariat was in power at the USSR from 1917 to 1956, during this period made incredible exploits, defeated <br> the Nazi -foster beast and gave the world a huge hope; In China, the dictatorship of the proletariat is <br> developed from 1949 to 1976, one of the most backward countries in the world, divided by various powers <br><br><br> imperialists, he advanced with his own forces spectacularly, performed the GRCP, a movement of<br>more transcendental masses in the history of humanity, built the popular communes, and the typical model <br> Is dictatorship of the proletariat the commune of Paris? Like Avakian, UOC (MLM) does not say that the aspect <br> MCI's principal in the twentieth century was the negative, they formally say that the experience was mainly <br> positive. But when UOC (MLM) evaluates that the two -month experience of proletarian power in the twentieth century <br> in the city of Paris advanced more toward the extinction of the state than the 39 years of dictatorship <br> proletariat in the USSR and the 37 years in China it is evident that in essence your balance converges <br> Completely with that of Avakian and Prachanda, which would easily repeat these same words: <br> “The case of the conception of the new state, expressed by Stalin at the end of his life, was actually <br> The Achilles heel of the state of dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia and China. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 182 <br> And the convergence of UOC (MLM), especially with Avakianism, is not restricted to balance <br> MCI Capitulationist. UOC (MLM) assumes almost entirely the revisionist conception of Avakian <br> about imperialism, that is, about the supposed progressive tendency of imperialism, that it liquidates <br> pre-capitalist relations in the semicolonies, in addition, of the alleged dynamic role of the anarchy of production <br> in the imperialist stage: <br> “Imperialism as an internationalized mode of production, it chained all countries with its <br> specific production modes in one world economy. The exported capital operates on the <br> germens or about the capitalist developments of the oppressed countries, and as a general trend, <br> accelerates its development, sweeps the traces of precapitalist production modes. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 183 <br> In his criticism of prachandism, UOC (MLM) emphasizes what he considers positive in Avakianism and <br> criticize this for lack of consequence: <br> “We support the correct criticism of PCR, use the Nepal revisionist party; what <br> We criticize that they are not consequent to the end, it is their centrist position. ” [UOC (MLM)] 184 <br> Avakianism is right -handed revisionism, there is nothing centrism. Avakian is the precursor <br> From this revisionist modality, he was the Master of Prachanda and must be criticized and held responsible as such. To the <br> UOC Criticisms (MLM) to Avakian's philosophy, they are just nominalist criticism, as they defend the same <br> Bourgeois conception only with different labels. <br> How an organization can say is Maoist and not take as the most developed the systematization of <br> Marxist philosophy contained in the contradiction of the punctual use that makes Marx of the manifestation of <br> Private movement of the law of contradiction which is the denial of denial? What would be the reason why a <br> organization that claims to be Maoist to, at some point in its history, change the name of its organ <br> theorist from contradicion for negación de la negación except for considering this the law as the most essential <br> of the materialistic dialectic? Or it was because it considers the denial of denial the law “which best explains the direction of the <br> movement, of the solution of contradiction ”? However, as in philosophy it would be to deny Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and <br> President Mao does not defend the law of contradiction as a fundamental law of materialistic dialectic, had to <br> explicitly declare that “we do not deny that the law of unity and struggle of contrary is the law <br> fundamental dialectic ”, however, continues to claim that the denial of denial” is “only the third law of <br> dialectic ”, but at the same time states that this is“ is the general law that indicates the direction of the movement in <br> various areas of social and natural life ”. Therefore, this is not an ignorance, it is falsification <br> philosophical. Smuggle bourgeois conceptions wrapped in the abstract concept of denial of denial is <br> impossible with the law of contradiction so fully formulated and applied by President Mao in all his <br> constructions. <br> UOC (MLM) takes the denial of denial not with the content defended by Marx and Engels, in The Capital <br> and in anti-dühring. This content as shown in the previous session is no other than one is divided into <br> two, that is, the unity between social production and private property, dissolves, breaks into interdependence, <br> Private property of the means of production - all - goes to the trash of history; social production as <br> The new aspect becomes a superior form: it rests on social productive forces, but advances <br> For the end of social classes, the social division of labor, the separation between field and city. The denial <br><br><br> of the denial of UOC (MLM) is an advance and at the same time a setback, a synthesis between progress and <br> Delay, as defines Proudhon, Dühring and Pachanda. And this forgery of the concept of denial of <br> negation serves the direction of UOC (MLM) to theoretically justify its revisionist positions, such as <br> Avakianist conception of imperialism:<br>“Thus at certain times and in certain oppressed countries, imperialism finds <br> more benefits in supporting pre-capitalist production modes, such as a hiring <br> capitalist development of such countries (…), in the process as a whole, the most <br> general and resulting from several and contradictory particular trends, has the progressive direction of <br> introduce and develop capitalist relations in the oppressed countries, in accordance with the law <br> of the denial of denial, one of the general laws of the movement, in this case of the movement of society ”. <br> [UOC (MLM)] 185 <br> We have already seen that the thesis of the progressive character of imperialism, which sometimes entered and now drives the relations of <br> Production in colonial and semicolonial countries is authored by Renegade Avakian. What should be emphasized in <br> above, in addition to the total agreement of UOC (MLM) with this revisionist thesis is its attempt to <br> justify it from its law of denial of denial. That is, for UOC (mlm) the supposed trend <br> progressive of imperialism, lives with its conservative "counter-time" in accordance with the <br> Its denial of denial, that is, a progress that is at the same time a setback. This forgery <br> philosophical is but the old revisionist principle that two combine in one, that is, for the <br> Imperialism is the result of the combination of progress and delay. And, moreover, progress is the “trend <br> more general ”. <br> UOC (MLM) uses the denial of Avakian's defenered denial to substantiate the Avakianist thesis <br> about imperialism. There is no inconsistency in this argument of UOC (MLM), after all this and <br> Avakian, by different ways they attack the law of contradiction in the same way. By different means apply the <br> revisionist principle of combining two in one. <br> And this is not an isolated example. In its military line, UOC (MLM) repeats the same content and forms the <br> Prachandist theory of the fusion, taught by them until March 2006. Let's see: <br> “Popular war acquires different forms depending on the country that is, be the form of <br> insurrection in imperialist countries and capitalist countries, be the prolonged form of popular war <br> in semi -feudal and semicolonial countries, either in a combination of urban insurrections with <br> peasant surveys and armed struggle in the predominantly oppressed countries <br> capitalists. ” [UOC (MLM)] 186 <br> Prachanda had announced that his fusion theory was valid for all countries in the world. A UOC (MLM) <br> Following its precept formulates its military line according to the revisionist mantra of Prachandismo, to <br> Announce the insurrection in cities with the objective of abandoning the armed struggle in the countryside. Exalts the insurrection <br> future as a way of eluding its capitulation in the face of the present task of organizing the peasant war as <br> Popular War. <br> In its analysis of the agrarian and peasant problem in Colombia, which we will analyze in detail but the front, the <br> UOC (MLM) Once again applies the philosophical forgery of integrating two into one. FUND IN ONE CATEGORY <br> The landowners and peasants combine two antagonistic aspects in one: landowners. <br> Thus conclude that in the Colombian field there is no more importance, the contradiction between the <br> large owners and small owners say that this antagonistic contradiction no longer exists and <br> defend the struggle of the "agricultural proletarians" against the "capitalist owners" and smuggling a <br> Trotskyist Agrarian Program: <br> “It is indispensable that the agricultural proletariat, which does not have the degree of concentration of the proletariat <br> industrial, be independent of peasantry, both by its program and its organization; only <br> Thus it can subtract from the rural small-bourgeois atmosphere of the owner and the illusion in the small <br> property. Only then can you teach the peasants that to save should be aligned with the <br> proletariat to fight private property and convert the property of its land into <br> collective property and exploitation, because the individual exploitation conditioned by the property <br> Individual, is the one that pushes the peasants to ruin. ” [UOC (MLM)] 187 <br><br><br> Thus UOC (MLM) does not properly differentiate friends from enemies, transforms all owners of <br> Earth in enemies and leaves the just and necessary struggle of poor landless peasants or with little land <br> for the take -over and sharing of the land of the landlords. For this it serves its philosophical falsification, <br> His false denial of denial, his rotten revisionist philosophy that argues two into one. <br> Finally, UOC (MLM) argues that the anti-imperialist struggle is immediately an anticapitalist struggle, fuses in <br> The same program tasks of the new democracy revolution and tasks of the socialist revolution. With one <br> “Anticapitalist radical” phraseology argues that the revolution in such oppressed capitalist countries is <br> immediately socialist, and thus completely abandons the indispensable stage of national liberation:<br>“The problem is how to scientifically understand the relationship between the struggle against imperialism <br> foreigner and the struggle for socialism in an oppressed country. (…) And in this case, in which the proletariat <br> has its purpose directly in socialism, the struggle against imperialism fully coincides with <br> the general internationalist character of the proletarian struggle, ceasing to be a democratic struggle for <br> defend the bourgeois nation, and becoming an anti -capitalist struggle for determining the world the <br> imperialism." [UOC (MLM)] 188 <br> They combine two in an Avakianist style suppressing the most important task of the moment. Renegade <br> Revolution of new democracy and assume the trotskyist assign of the “permanent revolution”. <br> 3- Unit in MCI cannot advance under the principle of integrating two in a <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) in stating that the denial of denial ”(...) is the general law that indicates the direction of the <br> movement in various areas of social and natural life ”, at no time marks the differences between <br> The conception of Proudhon, Dühring, Avakian or Prachanda about the denial of the denial of understanding and <br> her use by Marx. Revisionism falsifies the use of denial of denial as a thesis, <br> Antithesis and synthesis, and takes synthesis as the integration of two into one. In the fight of two lines around the <br> CIMU, UOC (MLM) explained its idealistic form of application of denial of denial and synthesis as <br> integration of two in one. In its position last year on the discussion base, the direction of <br> UOC (MLM) states that the proposal presented by CCIMU: <br> “(…) Does not represent a base of common general unity, to continue the struggle around <br> of the divergences that are now legitimate within the revolutionary communists, <br> because such a proposal only expresses the position of a particular hue of the movement <br> communist." [UOC (MLM)] 189 <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) protests against the fact of the discussion, presented by CCIMU for the <br> public debate at MCI, express only what it calls “a private hue” and proposed that the CCimu <br> should have presented a common general unit base. That is, we should present a synthesis <br> before the struggle develops. This method does not correspond to the communist method, as a base <br> Common can only be reached through the fight of two lines. After all, this common base, as an expression of <br> a revolutionary synthesis, not of balance and eclectic composition; could only be achieved by <br> the struggle of two lines that resulted in an adequate solution of differences that allowed to reach <br> certain commitments. This was what CCIMU did: launched a discussion base, which <br> evidently should express the ideological hue of its proponents, which, public post, how there is <br> decades did not occur in MCI, led the very important struggle of two lines about this proposition that <br> reflected, as it should be, in the debates of CIMU expressing itself in the political statement and <br> Principles and other resolutions such as the conformation of the International Communist League. Two -line fight <br> that follows and will continue to develop in another and new level. <br> It is too much idealism, to believe that an organization, or even a set of organizations, <br> I could soon find by its mere intellectual effort a base of common unit. What would be the <br> Criteria for the preparation of this document? Seek among the different positions a common result, a <br> Synthesis, what does unit mean? We should act as Proudhon, criticized by Marx for trying <br> idealistic way “(...) to tear from God, from absolute reason, a synthetic formula” 190 that represented <br> a general base of unit? This would be nothing but “integrate two in one”, this would represent the <br> Delegation of the struggle of two lines, would be to transform the communist unit into bourgeois diplomacy. For <br><br><br> facing the concrete problem of dispersion in the communist movement, we could not put our <br> positions, our shades under the rug, as some do, pretend that divergences are problems <br> secondary and unimportant for the proletarian revolution. These are problems that must be on the <br> table, to steal the fight over them is to delude ourselves with a false unit colluded with good intentions outside <br> of the field of the fight. <br> The strength of CIMU and the fortress of its political statement and principles is that it was the result of the struggle of <br> Two lines that preceded it and the struggle of two lines that took place within the conference itself. In the course <br> of CIMU, the struggle of two lines between the positions present and not the criticism of the back of <br> absent organizations. It was this correct method that allowed the discussion base to have modifications, <br> in the forms of a new understanding in certain divergences and solution of some other problems <br> allowing commitments between organizations to be achieved. And this unit reached there<br>Did you represent the end of the two -line struggle? No, it allows the two -line struggle to develop <br> Now at another level, a new unit on a higher base. In Cimu fully fulfilled the <br> President Mao was taught to us about the dialectical method for the party's internal unity: <br> “The fundamental concept of dialectic is the unity of the opposites. If you accept it, as you should <br> So treat the comrades who made mistakes? First, fight them to <br> End of liquidating your wrong ideas and secondly helping them. That is, first, <br> Fight and, second, help. Starting from goodwill, help them correct their mistakes in a way <br> that have a way out. (...) under the condition of not disregarding the Marxist principles <br> Leninists, we accept the acceptable opinions of others and discard those of ours who <br> can be discarded. So we act with two hands: one for the fight with the comrades <br> that incorporate the other for the unit with them. (...) the integration of fidelity with <br> principles with flexibility constitutes a Marxist-Leninist principle and is a unit of <br> contrary. (...) One is divided into two: this is a universal phenomenon, this is dialectical. ” <br> (President Mao) 191 <br> This is the communist method in view of the differences: first, the struggle; secondly, decide for <br> unanimous or by majority, or reach commitments, according to the nature of differences, if antagonistic <br> or non-antagonistic, depending on the conditions of a given process and for a certain period, until <br> Even with the enemy it is possible and necessary to reach appointments. Seeking commitments before the fight is <br> Applying the philosophical falsifications of Proudhon or Pachanda, is to try to accommodate, balance and fuse <br> distinct positions. This means the end of the struggle of two lines, its replacement with colludes and, <br> Consequently, the impossibility of the development of communist organizations. Great <br> Philosophical controversy, in 1964/65, in Popular China, the revisionists of the Liu Shao-Chorado Band advocated <br> That President Mao's international line was an example that "two are part of one." The referred <br> Remina Ribao article of May 20, 1965, refutes this forgery as follows: <br> “They try to create the impression that this [international] line can also be made from <br> of your 'integrate two in one' (...) the so -called 'synthesis' of 'integrate two in one' lawyer <br> by Yang Sian-Chast and others abolish the fight. (...) Criticism and struggle based on the desire for unity <br> It is exactly the process of one dividing in two. A new unit on a more <br> high is achieved through criticism and struggle and after overcoming error, it is also <br> A result of dividing one into two. This higher base is not absolutely a base <br> “Integrate two in one 'of combining hit and error, but a base of dividing one into two <br> between hit and error. ” (Ai Si-Chi) 192 <br> In the present fight of two lines in MCI about CIMU and Foundation of LCI, the direction of the Communist Party <br> of Nepal (revolutionary maleist), PCN (MR) has publicly pronounced on two occasions, a <br> About the discussion base, in September 2022, and another months after the announcement of the CIMU. <br> In the first, it greets the public position of parties and organizations on political issues and <br> ideological stating that “a new debate began. Many questions of unity and divergence came to <br> surface in these debates. This is not wrong. ” Then positions itself holding several times that <br> The struggle is absolute and unity is relative; This is correct and we greeted them by clear positioning, as for <br> this. However, it criticizes the fact that it did not appear a joint statement, among the different initiatives <br> who advocated a unified conference. However, this common statement could only be a result <br> development of the two -line struggle in a new level, that is, in CIMU itself, for which those <br> who publicly expressed disagreements were invited to take part with rights and duties as <br><br><br> the others.* Defend, therefore, the need for a joint statement before the struggle is minimally <br> Developed is both idealism and illusion and the possibility of “integrating two into one”. The direction of <br> PCN (MR) also proposed: “Conform a new organizing committee to hold a conference <br> Unified international through the dissolution of both coordinating committees ”. In this regard, it is <br> it is necessary to clarify that there was only, in 2022, a coordinating committee, which was the CCIMU, which boosted the <br> two line struggle, publicly, from the publication of the discussion base and had already carried out dozens <br> meetings and attempts to understand, as is clear from the reference note above. The defenders of <br> Another conference held a meeting called, via the Internet, by PCM-Italy, with its criteria<br>liberalists and legalists, calculating that his defamatory report on P.C.B. and the attacks against what <br> He called “Gonzalista Block” and others “Block of Especially Maoism”, he would in herself unite those <br> Parties and organizations to hold a “unity conference” at the end of that same year <br> began, as the meeting deliberated, in the objective of doing it before CIMU, based on the document by <br> a new international organization of the proletariat, PCI (M), also deliberated that would invite the <br> “Gonzalista Block” to participate and if he did not participate he would be reported to MCI as a divisionist etc. <br> These are the terms of the minutes of this meeting, in which not even any balance, to be minimally serious as <br> Marxist, he became the proposed at the 2013 meeting, in which some of those participants there officialized the <br> End of already bankrupt MRI, to promote a series of tasks and activities for a conference <br> international for reviving the MRI. This is not to say about the lack of any proposition about the balance of the <br> MCI and the historical experience of the world proletarian revolution. About the then international situation of <br> great disorders and sharpness of the fundamental contradictions of the world, especially the main <br> Opposes nation/people oppressed to imperialism, also nothing. Much less there was any self -criticism of the <br> their immobilism and even neglect of MCI, due to narrow and petty interests <br> Hegemonists. Participants of this January 2020 meeting, not all, signed the same <br> Declaration of May 1, 2022. Then, propose, as the PCN declaration (MR), the dissolution of the <br> Ccimu to merge into a single “coordination” with parties that, after all this <br> unilateral form the false reports on the process of CIMU presented in this meeting, by the direction <br> of PCM-Italy, about all done in more than ten years of hard and selfless internationalist work <br> for almost 20 M-L-M parties and organizations, it would be to leave CIMU and everything that had cost more than <br> painful but successful efforts, being dragged to the cowardly liquidationism, so we could not <br> consent. <br> * Only PCI (m) was not possible to reach the invitation to CIMU, held clandestinely. And had been, since 2014, with the <br> Loss of contact from our party with the PCI (m), to the present day the difficulty in restoring this contact. In the same way <br> None of the parties and organizations committed to the realization of CIMU did not have it. Parties that claim to have contact with the CC of <br> PCI (M) and who attended the January 2020 meeting, never willing to help us restore it. There have been n attempts since <br> 2014 for restoring contact and when, as early as 2017, by a bearer, the document arrived by a new organization <br> International of the PCI proletariat (m) with the request to pass it on to the parties and Maoist organizations that we had contact and <br> May they make their comments about it. As soon as this document arrived in our party, immediately the <br> we transmit to all M-L-M parties and organizations that we had safe contact, including, through PCM-Galicia, was <br> transmitted to the PCM (Italy), one of the first to receive it, so that it also surrender it to the parties and organizations that had <br> contact. And we did it exactly as we asked for us through the bearer that transmitted it to us. From P.C.B .. for several <br> years becoming persistent efforts to get to the CC of PCI (m) our correspondence by restoring the communication channel, <br> Our comments to your document and a detailed report of the entire preparation process for CIMU. But unfortunately, <br> We do not burn him. And because PCI (m) did not make public this document, our party did not understand it because it is not <br> authorized to do so. However, we do not understand what the cause of all this time the direction of the PCI (m) does not contact us, <br> that we had fluid contact until the occurrence of security problems that interrupted it once and again, after <br> The channel is restored without which we stayed to the present day. It is also not a matter of less importance, by the way, the <br> Fact that, after the party meeting held in January 2020, our party took the initiative to look for the PCM (Italy) <br> proposing a meeting of our party with all the parties and organizations participating in that January meeting <br> which was agreed to perform it as readily as possible. Our purpose was to listen to them and present the CCIMU report on the <br> CIMU preparation process, since most of these parties only had the version of PCM-Italy and PCM (Galicia) <br> CIMU process, and that if it could come to an understanding of the preparation of CIMU. However, on the pretext of<br>COVID-19 pandemic problems, this meeting has never been held. It is a fact that the sanitary restrictions imposed by the states <br> imperialists and their lacnacies created certain difficulties, but not to the point of preventing communist parties and organizations from <br> gathered at some point. After all, the proletariat and other popular masses have not stopped working or fighting <br> Italy and not in any country. CCIMU continued to perform activities taking the necessary care, as well as the campaigns of <br> masses against the reactionary measures of cutting workers' rights under the pretext of the economic crisis and measures to combat <br> pandemic. After insistent charges of ours for this meeting was proposed by the same PCM-Italy that gathered our party, the <br> PCM-Italy and PCM-Galicia. Although our proposition was to meet with the maximum of the parties participating in that meeting of <br> January, we agreed to gather us in the hope that the broader meeting would be held, but in fact it was clear there that such a meeting was <br> It was not in the interest of PCM-Italy, which did everything to fail our attempts to understand. This was a serious problem <br> that affected the process. The direction of PCM-Galicia is an eyewitness of this. <br><br><br> In its second public note on CIMU and the founding of LCI, November 2023, the direction of the <br> PCN (MR) declares to have been late to comment, when he had already done so, because the whole year <br> previous one was committed to the Unification process of the PCN (MR) with the NCP (most) <br> dealing with this issue separately and awaited the conclusion of this process to have a single <br> pronouncement. It also says it is admirable that so many parties and organizations have achieved a <br> conference to create an international center for the proletariat, particularly the moment <br> crosses the world. Therefore announces that it has divergence in some topics of the political declaration and <br> LCI Principles and enumerates them as 9 questions. Along these claims that certain statements from <br> Declaration, however, considers that the declaration does not have an integral understanding of the concepts of Marxism. <br> Even if this declaration of the PCN (MR) is not a direct object of this document, even because the <br> positions expressed therein are planting in the referred document of UOC (MLM) of January 2023 that <br> It also deals with the founding of LCI, we cannot fail to reaffirm our criticisms of the positions of the <br> PCN (MR), which in this second statement about LCI were more completely externalized their nature <br> Directist. Take only the first point where it says is in accordance with 4 of the 5 principles of <br> demarcation between Marxism and revisionism defined in the LCI declaration, and that, the principle of <br> “Or not to recognize the omnipotence of revolutionary violence to make the revolution in its own people” is <br> Reduce Maoism to "Revolutionary Violence." States that violence is only “an integral part of the <br> Marxism but no more powerful than Marxism ”; and citing President Mao, in problems with <br> War and strategy all their assertions that synthesize themselves in “the power is born of the rifle”, then <br> argue that President Mao would have affirmed these concepts in a certain context. Why, what was <br> Is the context if not the treatment of war problems and strategy as a means of making the revolution? <br> Pure wordplay. Soon says that the statement conceives the statement that “yes we are supporters of <br> omnipotence of revolutionary war ”as if it was narrowly <br> Lenin that “Marxism is omnipotent” to say that Marxism “is more omnipotent than <br> violence". Here, who tries to separate violence from Marxism but the direction of the PCN (MR)? It is revisionism <br> Avakianist intends to dissociate revolutionary violence, the popular war of Maoism, because the fundamental <br> of Maoism is the power to the proletariat, power conquered and defended by an armed force directed <br> by the Communist Party. Then the argument revolves the other position on it and states that the <br> Statement is right, because today all revisionism stands against that the popular struggle is used <br> of violence. But, it does not stop there its incongruities, because, without more and without less, concludes that the <br> Declaration has “militaristic” conceptions. Does so many years of popular war and break with the <br> Didn't national and play classes have not served to clarify such a patent issue? Or it will be <br> that the break with prachandism was not about to get rid of its revisionist inventions such as <br> “Fusion Theory”, a new way of presenting the rotten “peaceful transition” Kruscovista in the form <br> deceiving the “combination of all forms of struggle”. Militaristic is the conclusion that takes the direction of <br> PCN (MR) in regretting the “fragility” of revolutionary forces in the world citing the surveys<br>of masses that explode around the world with the example of those in Sirilanka, complaining that <br> mass surveys in this country, those of so many countries, just as they arise, disappear soon, and <br> That not even, in the case of Sirilanka, there was a “small army” to follow the fight. It's not the <br> military organization that defines the character of the revolutionary war of the proletariat in the new revolution <br> democracy or socialist revolution, but the military ideology and conception that trains the party <br> revolutionary of the proletariat. <br> As a general conclusion the PCN direction (MR) closes its criticism <br> “Divisionist” about CIMU and LCI. On the contrary, CIMU and LCI put the fight of two lines in <br> a higher level, divisionism is not to join what advances based on the principles of Marxism to fight <br> by the unit in new and higher base. So Marx was a divisionist for sending the General Council of <br> Ait for the United States so that it had its purpose and does not allow it to be murdered by the <br> Unity without principles? Lenin was a divisionist for founding the III International passing over the <br> “Heroes of the II International”? Who divided MCI in 1963/64, was the PCCH of President Mao or was the <br> Kuschovista revisionism of the “three peaceful and two all”? How the exhaustion of I and II exceeded <br> International, if not by jumping ahead in the organization as an expression of ideological-political advancement with the <br> Total break with opportunism? When the vast majority of social democratic parties in Europe and <br> United States sank into the betrayal of the defense of the bourgeoisie of their respective countries in the 1st war <br> Imperialist world, Lenin founded the III International was with a “common base” that returned from <br> more advanced organizational experiences of the international proletariat or it was based on the inflexible defense <br> of the principles of Marxism, being the most prominent among them the organizational principle of centralism <br><br><br> Democratic he formulated? Defend a generic unit of MCI rejecting the principle <br> Organizational of the international proletariat, the democratic centralism, what is it for? Pose <br> responsible, prudent and cautious and being in correspondence with objective reality and speaking <br> In principles of Marxism: Which principles should be left out in such a “common base”? That “unit <br> wider ”is this one that is necessary to gather MCI? There is only one unit, the conquered in the struggle <br> of classes and in the struggle of two lines, based on the inflexible defense of all the principles of Marxism. <br> Argue that the communist movement is unable to join the basis of centralism <br> Democratic is to defend a unity without principles between communists. Treat the application of centralism <br> democratic as something sectarian because many “communist parties” would not agree, <br> That insisting on this causes the weakening of the international communist movement is absurd, as well as narrow. <br> It is not to understand this principle as unity of opposites. The principles are applied with mediations, <br> Applying democratic centralism does not mean having to make all decisions by majority. The just and correct <br> application of democratic centralism deals divergences on crucial issues for the unit in which <br> they manifest acute contradictions, through a patient process of fighting two lines, and that after exhausting it <br> to the maximum without obtaining a solid majority that does not threate <br> to transient duration commitments. Thus demonstrates the practice of true parties <br> Communists in historical experience. It is false and misleading, otherwise a pilgrim argument states that the <br> Adoption of the principle of democratic centralism does not join MCI today, this is a revisionist point of view. <br> So it is, so, in the communist parties in fact. Very strange to Marxism is not to organize with <br> based on the principle of democratic centralism, its defense as an organizational principle of the proletariat <br> revolutionary. That party can claim communist and not take democratic centralism as <br> Principle or take it as if it were a ruler, without mediations in its application? A party that asserts itself <br> communist and does not accept to unite on the basis of democratic centralism or has nothing of Marxism or should <br> take part in other wider forms with a single front, such as the necessary and decisive anti-movement <br> imperialist to be built. The end of the Entern took place in a much more complex situation than the simple <br> reason that it is claimed that its organic form no longer served to strengthen the MCI. There was not <br> Also, at least two other reasons of paramount importance, one to keep the single front together <br> world anti -fascist, in the midst of war, in which the allies pressured and blackmailed<br>existence (see secret correspondence between Stalin, Churchil and Roosevelt) and another, about the danger of <br> positions of directs if they worship it (signs of new revisionism already appeared in important parties of the <br> West, the short existence of subsequent cominform proves it too much. For various reasons to Comintern <br> exhausted and had to jump to a new level corresponding to the international situation of <br> strategic balance between proletariat and imperialism, of the reaction of the imperialists then already under the <br> Yankee hegemony, who drew his claws with his cold war strategy and atomic blackmail. A <br> Still very little known of Comiform illustrates and clarifies the issue very well. It's opportunism <br> to claim with the statement of President Mao that the end of Comintern "was a right decision" to justify <br> directism, just like that he said that Stalin “gave some bad advice” without fully taking the <br> That he expressed, as we can see here: “When you made mistakes, Stalin could do the self -criticism. Per <br> Example, gave some bad advice on the Chinese revolution. After it triumphed, <br> recognized your mistakes. ” (PCCH COMMENT, ABOUT THE STALIN PROBLEM). <br> For the new birth it is necessary that the old man who prevents the flowering of this new and is the fight, the <br> rupture and jump, the division of one in two that takes place with the new establishing itself as a new unit of <br> contrary, also one divided into two. It is necessary that in something old, the new as a dominated aspect <br> defeat in the struggle the old dominant aspect, submits it by passing the dominant, dividing and destroying something <br> old man, something new. One must divide into two. The Birth of the Communist League <br> International marks, there <br> Capitulatory in MCI; CIMU also marks the death of sectarianism, intrigue and <br> Hegemonism in place of the two -line struggle, which has become MRI in its last years of existence. And the <br> Political declaration and principles is superior to MRI's previous statements, because, in addition to advances <br> MCI's balance sheet positives, there are no anti-Stalin revisionist positions and unacceptable criticism <br> opportunists to President Mao present in the 1980 and 1984 documents. CIMU is a victory for <br> international proletariat, the dispersion in MCI was largely won and marched firmly and <br> decided for the reconstitution of the communist international amid the development of the revolution <br> World proletarian, in this new period of revolutions in which world history is entering. <br><br><br> Finally, one last question about the philosophical theme. In its recent position, the affirmation of <br> UOC (MLM) that the law of contradiction is the fundamental law of dialectic but that it is not its fundamental law <br> Unique, it is a pilgrim attempt to click the discussion. They can no longer deny that the law of contradiction is the law <br> fundamental, however they continue to claim that the denial of denial is the one that best explains the direction of the <br> movement. Its rectification must be complete: recognize that the law of contradiction is the fundamental law <br> unique dialectic and extend this recognition to which other laws are derived or forms of <br> Private manifestation of the law of contradiction. What does derived laws mean? It means they are laws <br> Private, specific expressions, of the only fundamental law which is contradiction. It means that, just like <br> explicit in the great philosophical debate, the law of quantity and quality, the law of affirmation and denial, are <br> derived laws or internal elements of the law of contradiction. In the great work strategic problems of <br> Revolutionary war in China, written in December 1936, that is, just a few months before <br> Formulation of the contradiction, President Mao states that: <br> “These are the two aspects of China's revolutionary war, aspects that exist <br> At the same time, that is, with favorable conditions there are difficulties. This is the law <br> Fundamental to the revolutionary war of China, from which many other laws are derived. ” <br> (President Mao) 193 <br> Of a particular fundamental law, other laws can be derived, these derived laws are manifestations <br> individuals of the fundamental law. As well as the law of freedom and necessity is an expression in social life, <br> particular manifestation in this form of movement of the matter of the law of contradiction. In relation to denial <br> of denial is the same, we understand that it is a form of manifestation of the unique fundamental law of the <br> dialectic, the law of contradiction. However, what we consider, as the most important in the current debate of the <br> MCI, on Marxist philosophy is: 1) that the law of contradiction is the only fundamental law of eternal matter <br> in its incessant transformation, therefore, of materialistic dialectic; 2) that, as a result, the law of<br>contradiction is the one that rules omnimodically, describes and explains, in its complexity, the movement of <br> matter and its direction in infinite ascending spiral form; 3) that the application of denial of denial by <br> Marx is distinct from the denial of the denial of Proudhon, Dühring, Avakian and Pachanda; 4th) That the dialectic <br> Marxist is based on the only principle that one is divided into two, and that the revisionist philosophy, in contrast <br> propugates the balance between opposing principles: that one is divided into two with that two are integrated <br> on a. <br> II- Imperialism and Democratic Revolution <br> In their criticism of LCI's parties and founding organizations, in particular, P.C.B., UOC (MLM) points <br> as dogmatism on our part the defense of the validity of the new democracy revolution in countries <br> semicolonials. We criticize us for a supposed lack of “objectivity” in our analysis of imperialism and <br> The development of capitalism in oppressed countries. Both in your criticism and other documents, <br> the direction of UOC (MLM) formulates a “new” theory of imperialism, which tries to pass as a <br> concrete and objective application of Maoism to the current worldwide situation and the oppressed countries. According to <br> UOC (MLM) Imperialism would be a “worldwide mode of production” in which they would live “two trends: <br> one to the stagnation (…) and another to progress ”. This supposed progressive tendency would mean that the <br> imperialism “sweeps the traces of pre-capitalist modes of production” in the countries oppressed by <br> imperialist powers. The swept of semi -feudality by imperialism would in turn imply <br> full development of the capitalism of these countries, particularly in the field and that the bourgeoisie of this <br> It would obtain “a profit rate equal to the bourgeoisie of other countries”, that is, imperialists. According to <br> UOC (MLM), the oppressed countries are of two types: 1) Oppressed capitalist countries and 2) semi -feudal countries, <br> That is, two types of semicolonies, capitalist semicolonia and semi -feudal semicolony. In its formulation <br> oppressed capitalist countries and semi -feudal countries, are both semicolonies, but the character of the revolution of <br> first would be immediately socialist and, only for semi -feudal countries, the revolution of <br> New democracy. <br> In analyzing Avakian's revisionist positions, it is not difficult to note that the source of the formulations of <br> UOC (MLM) About imperialism is precisely Avakianism. Like this revisionist variant, the <br> UOC (MLM) defends imperialism as a mode of world production whose dynamism sweeps <br> semi -feudal production relations, resulting in the emergence of predominantly oppressed countries <br><br><br> capitalists whose revolution must be immediately socialist. In addition, UOC (MLM) applies this formulation <br> Avakianist in the “concrete analysis” of the Colombian situation, as we will show below. <br> According to the analysis of UOC (MLM), Colombia would be an oppressed capitalist country and, therefore, the character <br> of the Colombian Revolution would be immediately socialist. For Colombian peasants, the consign of <br> “Earth for those who work in it” would no longer be on the agenda. Taking only one data: Colombia is the <br> Latin American country champion of land property concentration, according to Oxfan investigations <br> (2016), 1% of the largest landowners hold 81% of land. Hence the nonsense contained in the <br> UOC (MLM), according to which the task of the communists in Colombia must be to “teach peasants (…) <br> fight against private property and convert property of its land into property and exploitation <br> collective ”194. <br> For UOC (MLM), if Colombia is an oppressed capitalist country, this condition would be even more explicit <br> in countries like Brazil, India and Philippines: <br> “(…) The behavior of the Brazilian, Indian and Philippine bourgeoisie during the last decades is not <br> absolutely that of a merely buying bourgeoisie. For example, the Indian state is a <br> peculiar type of postcolonial capitalist state characterized by a bourgeoisie that is neither <br> national (…), no buyer (because, not only servant and intermediate of the imperialists and <br> … Has made independent political decisions in contradiction with the metropolitan bourgeoisie) and <br> even less, an imperialist bourgeoisie (because the importance of capital by the bourgeoisie <br> Indiana is much larger than its capital exports that has undoubtedly increased during <br> last two decades). The character and role that has the Brazilian bourgeoisie in relation to the BRICS, <br> demonstrates that its international role has left much of being a buying bourgeoisie or <br> subjugated completely to imperialism and that, within its limits, aspires to be a regional actor who <br> expresses positions of predominance in relation to other oppressed countries. ”[UOC (MLM)] 195 <br> That is, the direction of UOC (MLM) concludes that Brazilian, Indian and Philippines bourgeoisie are no longer<br>buyer character. States that the Brazilian and Indian bourgeoisie, in particular, although they are not <br> Imperialists, already export capital, rival the “metropolitan” bourgeoisie and subjugate other countries <br> oppressed. On the contrary, what the PCP, TKP/ML, PCI (M), PCF and P.C.B. And the vast majority <br> of Marxist-Leninist-Mao parties, UOC (MLM) suggests that revolutions in these countries would be <br> immediately socialist. <br> The international line for MCI, proposed by UOC (MLM) points to a decrease in the importance of <br> Revolutions of new democracy, as an integral part of the world proletarian revolution. After all, if the <br> imperialism follows “scanning” semi -feudality in the oppressed countries, there are more and more countries in the <br> “oppressed capitalists” and the immediate socialist revolution would be in force for a number <br> growing from countries around the world. This analysis and conclusion of UOC (MLM) is a complete review of Leninism, <br> mainly from his theory of imperialism. <br> Unlike this conclusion of UOC (MLM), the scientific ideology of the proletariat, Marxism-Leninism- <br> Maoism, points out that in the imperialist phase of capitalism, national oppression increases and does not decay, that the <br> trend in every line for political reaction and violence is a law of imperialism that has buried and abolished <br> all progressive character that had capitalism, with the passage of the capital of its free competition phase <br> For the monopolies phase, upper and final stage of capital. This is what the great chiefs of the <br> international proletariat, is ABC of Leninism and Maoism and is what we are seeing <br> True in the world today: the growth of colonial oppression by superpowers and powers <br> imperialists and, especially, the explosive growth of the wars and national liberation struggles of which the <br> Heroica Palestinian National Resistance is the most inspiring example to the international proletariat. O <br> imperialism is parasitism and decomposition of capital, it is an agonizing condition, whose crisis is the material base <br> of the accelerated rot of bourgeois democracy, expressed in the reactionary of state and growth <br> dizzying of their fascistization in all countries of the globe. Therefore, very unlike the conclusions of <br> UOC (MLM), the meaning of new democracy revolutions for the world revolution only increased <br> its importance in recent decades. Understand the relationship of the democratic revolution with the revolution <br> Proletarian is today, more than ever, a decisive issue for communists around the world. <br> 1- The fallacious “progressive tendency of imperialism” <br><br><br> For the direction of UOC (MLM), the imperialist phase is a particular mode of production of capitalism, <br> repeating the Avakianist mantra state that in the stage of free competition “the world economy was not <br> and the economies of each country were structured as independent processes, external to the <br> others, gradually linked by the market ”. That is, they were linked only by the market, <br> in the sphere of circulation. In imperialism, the world economy would have “unified in one process (…) <br> converting to worldwide market, the production itself, breaking the autonomy of the economies <br> of the countries and chasing them in a single productive process ”196. <br> This mode of globalized production, as opposed to the capitalism of the phase of free competition, would consist <br> the “progressive” aspect of imperialism: “In the imperialist phase two trends live: one <br> Stanning and economic and political crises; and another to progress, the socialization of production <br> world. ”197 for UOC (MLM), this growth of socialization of world production would be a trend <br> “Progressive” because it would lead to the sweeping of semi -feudality: <br> “Imperialism as an internationalized mode of production, it chained all countries with its <br> specific production modes in one world economy. The exported capital operates on the <br> germens or about the capitalist developments of the oppressed countries, and as a general trend, <br> accelerates its development, sweeps the traces of pre-capitalist production modes. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 198 <br> Moreover, “capitalism itself by converting to world mode of production” expresses more <br> clear that "the proletariat of all countries sells its workforce to the world bourgeoisie." A <br> bourgeoisie of semicolonial countries, in turn, becomes “partner and participant of the world system of <br> imperialism". And by “benefiting from imperialist relations (…) it obtains a profit rate equal to the <br> bourgeoisie from other countries ”. In this way the UOC (mlm) defines that: <br> “(…) Imperialism is an internationalized mode of production that includes others, influences them, <br> transforms, wears them, exhaust them, into a worldwide process of production, accumulation and <br> generation of added value. ”[UOC (MLM)] 199<br>According to the documents of UOC (MLM), its conception of imperialism can be summarized from the following <br> Form: In the stage of free competition the world economy cooked through the market; in the stage <br> imperialist, capitalism became an internationalized mode of production, chained all <br> Countries, regardless of their specific production modes in one world economy. This one <br> chain led to the sweeping of pre-capitalist production modes and the conversion of bourgeoisie <br> semicolonials in members of the imperialist world system, which ensures a “profit rate equal to the <br> imperialist bourgeoisie ”. Thus, a worldwide bourgeoisie that explores the <br> proletariat of all countries. Imperialism comes down to a worldwide process of production, accumulation <br> and generation of added value. <br> This conception of UOC (MLM), attentive to the Leninist Theory of Imperialism in its entirety, against <br> Marxist bases of the study on the capitalist mode of production and converges with “theory” Kautskista <br> of ultraimperialism. <br> First, the conclusion of the UOC (MLM) that in the free competition phase of the production mode <br> Capitalist “The World Economy was not covenous” is completely opposite to Marxism. Like the <br> Greater Marx already demonstrates in the Communist Party manifesto, the great industry and the world market <br> They conform a dialectical unit, in which large industry is the main aspect. However, <br> both determine each other, that is, the large industry determines the conformation of the market <br> Unique World that, in turn, accelerates the development of this same large industry. For Marx, the <br> Great industry develops only as it cohesides the world economy: <br> “Great Industry has created the world market, already prepared by the discovery of America. O <br> world market has prodigiously accelerated the development of trade, navigation and <br> means of transportation by land. This development influenced, in turn, at the height of the industry, <br> and as the industry, trade, navigation and iron lines were extended, <br> developed the bourgeoisie, multiplying its capitals and relegating the second term all classes <br><br><br> Legated by the Middle Ages. The modern bourgeoisie, as we see, is already the result of a wide process <br> development, a series of revolutions in production and exchange mode. ” (Marx and <br> Engels) 200 <br> This is the period of flowering of capitalism, in which the bourgeoisie, while the new social force <br> Revolutionary, relegated to the past all medieval frets. Free competition capitalism does not <br> could develop, much less reach the imperialist phase, if the economies of each country are <br> structure as independent processes. The intertwining of the world economy in the only process, the <br> international division of labor, are not particularities of imperialism, they are historical achievements <br> previous stage of free competition. This is what Marx and Engels establish as follows: <br> “Upon exploitation of the world market, the bourgeoisie gave a cosmopolitan character to the production <br> worldwide and the consumption of all countries. With great feeling of the reactionaries, they settled <br> industry its national base. The old industries have been destroyed and are destroying <br> continuously. Are supplanted by new industries, whose introduction becomes a vital question <br> for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer employ raw materials of the place, <br> but raw materials sold from the most distant regions of the world, and whose products not only <br> They consume in their own country, but in all parts of the globe. Instead of ancient isolation and <br> bitterness of regions and nations, a universal exchange, an interdependence <br> universal of nations. And this refers to material production both and intellectual. The production <br> Intellectual of a nation becomes the common heritage of all. Narrows and exclusivism <br> nationals today result in the most impossible day; numerous national and local literature <br> forms a universal literature. ” (Marx and Engels) 201 <br> There is any doubt that for Marx, as established in the founding work of scientific socialism, the <br> Is world production a unique process precisely in free competition capitalism? The market <br> Universal presupposes large industry, both constitute contradictory aspects of material production <br> Universal, which represents the basis for universal intellectual production. These are historical products of <br> World bourgeois revolution, which ended with the advent of imperialism and which, with the revolution <br> October 1917, in Russia, the bourgeoisie as a class historically lost its appearance <br> Revolutionary and progressive, completely moving to counterrevolution. Therefore, in no way<br>imperialism promotes any progress, if not, on the contrary, as a reaction throughout the line <br> also against all these achievements achieved by humanity. <br> But UOC (mlm) does not miss only when characterizing elements already present and constituted in the free phase <br> competition as if they were particularities of the imperialist stage, distort the very characterization of the <br> that would be this internationalized production. When dealing with the two trends of imperialism, it highlights the <br> socialization of world production as if it could exist in the capitalist mode of production without its <br> contrary aspect: capitalist private property. When this reschedule that imperialism arises as <br> a mode of production that chases the economies of countries as a single production process, hides the <br> fact that alongside the socialization of growing production the capitalists continue to confront each other in the <br> capitalist market as private owners. That is, the imperialist world has not become a <br> single factory in a single world capital that jointly exploits the proletarians of all countries in the <br> world. Such conclusions also smell a lot of the “postmodern” thesis of “global capital” defended by <br> revisionists and opportunists embellishing the bourgeois ideology of “globalization”, see Prachanda and <br> company. <br> Imperialism besides being “(...) a worldwide process of production, accumulation and generation of <br> VALUE ”, is, at the same time, a worldwide process of unbridled, violent and reactionary dispute for <br> Office of this added value, by the private appropriation of this added value. If the prehistory of capitalism <br> Blood sprinkling through all the pores, the present history of imperialism is the most bloody war of <br> imperialist bourgeoisie for the division of this surplus produced worldwide and Botim, for the loot and <br> prey from semicolonial countries. The imperialist bourgeoisie, in turn, disputes with the bourgeoisie of the countries <br> semicolonials, with the great bourgeoisie of these countries (bureaucratic and buyer) who will have the largest <br> portion of the social value produced in them. Therefore, it becomes completely unreasonable to say that in <br> Imperialism The bourgeoisies of the semicolonies earn the same rate of profit as their imperialist “partner”. <br><br><br> Capitalist private property constitutes the right of the bourgeoisie to appropriate the work of others <br> paid, to appropriate the added value. The golden dream of a progressive trend of imperialism, <br> widespread by UOC (MLM), hides “only” the fact that the growing socialization of production with the <br> private property of the means of production is the fundamental condition of existence of capitalism, it is its <br> fundamental contradiction, in which these two aspects conform a unity of opposites - capitalism <br> - whose dominant aspect is the private property of the means of production. This condition and contradiction <br> fundamental of capitalism is the same in its stage of free competition and in the monopolistic stage, but in the <br> condition that, in the second, simultaneously the acceleration of the socialization of production, it is produced <br> greater leaps in the concentration and centralization of capital, due to the monopolistic character of the aspect <br> dominant. Let's see how Lenin treats this issue in a way, when analyzing the phenomenon of <br> socialization of production in imperialism: <br> “(…) There is a gigantic progress of the socialization of production”, however “the appropriation <br> remains private. ” (Lenin) 202 <br> Then, the monopolistic property, typical of the imperialist phase cannot boost this socialization of <br> Production without enhancing, at all times, the conflict with it. The socialization of production, at the time of <br> Imperialism, therefore, advances in an opposite way to the progressive character highlighted by Marx in the manifesto. <br> The advance of capitalist production, in its monopolistic phase, does not sweep the pre-capitalist production modes, <br> very unlike this, financial capital through capital export, mainly, is supported by <br> in these putrefate foundations, keeping them underlying and does so through the evolution of their forms, not few <br> sometimes in an apparent "wage". Already the monopolistic competition (brutal competition) is based on the search <br> of the maximum profit and leads, inevitable and especially to the imperialist wars of aggression and prey, to the struggle <br> by the departure of the world, the world imperialist war, colonial enslavement and fascism to <br> confront the world proletarian revolution. Imperialism had thus prepared the objective conditions for the <br> advancement of the world proletarian revolution in each country in the forms of socialist revolutions and revolutions of <br> new democracy uninterrupted to socialism, respectively corresponding to the nature of each country, in a <br> unequal development process, but of one proletarian direction. <br> The advent of imperialism and its contrary, the world proletarian revolution, began the disaggregation of<br>unique capitalist market and in no way led to a mode of production that united countries in a <br> Single process. As highlighted by comrade Stalin: <br> “The disintegration of a unique and comprehensive world market must be considered the sequence <br> most important economic of World War II and its economic consequences. She <br> determined the even greater deepening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system. ” (Stalin) 203 <br> With the development of imperialism and the advent of the world proletarian revolution or the existence of <br> a unique world market is assured, the less one can speak of the conformation of a mode of <br> production that chases the countries of the world in a single process. Much less in a trend <br> Progressive imperialism that sweeps semi -feudality. President Mao takes up as follows <br> These important theses of the VI Congress of the IC, for the semicolonial countries: <br> “Imperialism is allied in the first term with the dominant layers of the preceding social regime <br> -The feudal lords and the commercial-use bourgeoisie, against most of the people. Everywhere, <br> Imperialism tries to preserve and perpetuate all those forms of precapitalist exploitation <br> (particularly in the field), which are the basis of the existence of its reactionary allies. (…) O <br> imperialism, with all the financial and military power that has in China, is the force that supports, encouraged, <br> Cultivate and retain feudal survival, with all its bureaucratic-military superstructure. ' <br> (VI Congress of the Communist International). ” (President Mao) 204 <br> How it is possible to try to reconcile the defense of Maoism with the fallacious thesis of the progressive tendency of the <br> imperialism? How it is possible to assert itself and say that imperialism sweeps semi -feudal relations <br> in semicolonial countries? UOC (MLM) claims not to despise that “in some countries the trend <br> predominantly was, especially at the beginning of the phase, reinforcing pre-capitalist production modes ”205. <br> Tries to reconcile his explicit deviation from Maoism with a patch: in some countries imperialism, in <br> Their starting, reinforced the pre-capitalist production modes. Thus convert the line of IC and the President <br> Mao in exception and create a false dichotomy in the history of imperialism: at the beginning of the stage, propelled <br><br><br> Pre-capitalist production modes; Then he swept them. It was missing only to UOC (MLM) to explain how it occurred <br> This imperialist metamorphosis: from the reaction throughout the line to the supposed progressive trend. In opposition <br> to revisionist conceptions like this, President Mao states that imperialism “(...) will never become <br> A Buddha. ” <br> Moreover, it clearly establishes that the purpose of imperialism by penetrating the countries overwhelmed <br> never was to develop a social formation, to make it progress, nor to sweep old modes of <br> production, on the contrary: <br> “By penetrating our country, the imperialist powers in no way proposed <br> Transform feudal China into a capitalist China. His goal was the opposite: to make it a <br> SEMICOLONY OR COLONY. ” (President Mao) 206 <br> Imperialism does not have a progressive tendency, nor can it be considered a mode of production that <br> It chains the countries of the world in the only process. As the comrade Stalin establishes, imperialism is: <br> “The intensified export of capitalism to colonies and dependent countries; the extension of <br> 'Spheres of influence' and colonial domains, which even embrace the entire planet; the transformation <br> capitalism in a world system of financial slavery and national oppression of <br> Gigantic majority of the globe population by a handful of 'advanced' countries; All this, for a <br> part, converted the different world economies and the different national territories <br> The same chain, called the World Economy; On the other hand, it divided the population of the planet into <br> two fields: the handful of 'advanced' capitalist countries, which exploit and oppress vast <br> colonies and vast dependent countries, and that of the huge majority of dependent colonies and countries, which <br> They see the struggle to break free from the imperialist yoke. ” (Stalin) 207 <br> It is noted the clear difference in the definition, because the UOC (mlm) classifies imperialism as a mode of <br> internationalized production that sweeps pre-capitalist production relations; The comrade Stalin defines it <br> as a world system of enslavement and national oppression. For Stalin, imperialism is not a way <br> production that converts national economies into a single process, but which converts them into “links <br> of the same chain ”. In this chain of domination, most of the world, colonial countries and <br> Semicolonials are farmed by imperialist domination. Suppose that imperialism promotes progress <br> of the oppressing countries is a completely revisionist conception. <br> UOC (MLM) states that “the tendency to democracy proper to the old bourgeois revolution was replaced<br>by the tendency to political reaction throughout the line and at all orders. ”Says this Leninist thesis, to <br> followed the revisionist thesis about two trends of imperialism. A conscientious reading <br> Lenin's formulations of imperialism inevitably lead to rejecting this hypothesis of <br> UOC (mlm). <br> After all, as already seen, Lenin brilliantly establishes that imperialism has one trend: <br> “Imperialism is the time of financial capital and monopolies, which bring with them, throughout <br> Part, the tendency towards domination, not for freedom. The reaction in the entire line, whatever the <br> political regime; the extreme exacerbation of contradictions also in this sphere: such is the result of this <br> trend. Also intensifies national oppression and the tendency for <br> annexations, that is, for the violation of national independence (because the annexation is but the <br> violation of the law of nations to self -determination). ” (Lenin) 208 <br> 2- Imperialism prevents national development <br> As seen, the UOC (MLM) distorts the Marxist-Leninist analysis of the transformation of free capitalism <br> competition in monopolistic capitalism, worldwide, by attributing an alleged tendency <br> progressive to imperialism. This “progress” would be on a worldwide scale as imperialism <br> would correspond to a unique production process, and in the oppressed countries, as it sweeps the modes of <br> Pre-capitalist production. It is impossible to ideologically reconcile these postulates with the Leninist analysis <br> that imperialism particularly intensifies national oppression. That is, the result of the capital <br><br><br> Exported by financial capital are no progress to the oppressed countries. What Lenin <br> highlights as a result of this export is the “extreme exacerbation of contradictions”, “the tendency to <br> domination, not for freedom ”. This particular condition of imperialism results in the increase of the struggle <br> of national liberation and makes it an inseparable part of the world proletarian revolution; the class struggle of <br> proletariat acquires an international character and the proletariat rises the only consequent direction of the struggles <br> of national and democratic liberation as a whole. The international proletarian movement and the movement <br> of national liberation, the first as a guideline and the second as the basis, inseparable aspects of RPM, <br> They constitute the only progressive tendency at the time of imperialism. <br> UOC (MLM), in an opposite manner to Leninism, concludes that the main result of the export of capital <br> for the oppressed countries would constitute the swept of pre-capitalist production relations by <br> imperialism and not in the intensification of national oppression and its sister Siamese the reproduction of relations <br> semi -feudal through the evolution of their forms. Take the predominance of production relations <br> capitalist in the colonial and semicolonial countries, which occurs in the imperialist time, as if they guarded <br> The same progressive content that once had in the stage of free competition capitalism. <br> Falsely interpret that the export of capital would result in the subordination of feudalism to capitalism, <br> and that this subordination would occur in the countries oppressed only in the imperialist phase. The export of <br> goods, the creation of the world market, typical of the free competition stage <br> Subordination of the relations of slave and feudal production to the capitalist mode of production. Shuffle, <br> thus, predominance with subordination, to draw the following conclusion: poor countries in which <br> capitalist relations predominate in the face of semi -feudal relations are “oppressed capitalist countries” and in these <br> Countries The revolution must be immediately socialist. Predominance, which for UOC (MLM) is equal to <br> subordination, then for her the revolution of new democracy would be in force today, only in countries in the <br> what the capitalist mode of production was subordinate to the feudal mode of production. We question in <br> What country in the world today capitalism is subordinate to feudalism? <br> UOC (MLM), considers that the subordination of pre-capitalist production relations to the mode of production <br> capitalist occurred only in the twentieth century. The subordination of the modes of slave and feudal production <br> the capitalist mode of production is by no means a product of imperialism, or resulting from the <br> export of capital. This subordination occurred in free competition capitalism, and was part of the <br> development of large industry, the creation of the single capitalist world market and the division <br> International Labor. Marx analyzes this issue as follows in The Capital: <br> “(...) When people whose production are in the inferior stages of slavery, corveia, <br> etc., enter a world market dominated by the capitalist mode of production, becoming the<br>sale of its products abroad the dominant interest, overlap with the barbaric horrors of the <br> Slavery, servitude, etc., the cruelty of excess work. The work of blacks in the states <br> southern North America preserved a certain patriarchal character while production was intended <br> mainly to the direct satisfaction of needs. To the extent, however, where <br> cotton became a vital interest of those states, excess work of blacks and consumption <br> of your life in 7 years of work have become integral parts of a coldly calculated system. <br> This was not about obtaining a certain amount of useful products. The objective became production <br> more of the added value. ” (Marx) 209 <br> Marx clearly points out that the world market emerges as a product of large industry and is born, therefore, <br> dominated by the capitalist mode of production. Worldwide, capitalism is already the mode of production <br> dominant since its development in the phase of free competition. However, the direction of UOC (MLM) <br> Cheers the analysis of the Maoists about Chinese society and claim that: <br> “Of these three texts and the cited conversations of Mao it is clear that (i) a social formation <br> semi -feudal and semicolonial is characterized by a limited development of capitalism and <br> Continuation of the domain of feudal production relations; The capitalist mode of production is <br> subordinate to the feudal mode of production and imperialist domination implemented through the <br> great imperialist commercial bourgeoisie ”. [UOC (MLM)] 210 <br> Concludes the UOC (MLM) that there is the possibility of the mode of capitalist production to be subordinate to the mode <br> feudal production in the imperialist stage, and commits the nonsense to say that this can be deducted from the works <br><br><br> of President Mao. In The Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party of China, the great helmsman says <br> what: <br> “The foundations of the natural economy of the feudal era were destroyed, but the exploitation of the peasantry by <br> landing class, base of the feudal exploration system, not only remains intact, but <br> linked to the exploration exerted by the buyer and usure capital, it predominates manifestly in the <br> China's economic and social life. ” (President Mao) 211 <br> UOC (MLM) interprets this predominance of latifundist exploitation as the subordination of the mode of <br> capitalist production to feudal mode of production in Chinese society. However, to reach such <br> conclusion need to hide that the dominant aspect in the process of development of the Chinese nation in the <br> twentieth century becomes imperialism, specifically, the imperialist powers that share the <br> Chinese coast in the first two decades, and especially the Japanese imperialism that expands its <br> colonization of northeast China in the south-central direction of the country in the late 1930s. That is, what <br> destroyed “the foundations of the natural economy of the feudal era” was not the nascent Chinese national capitalism, but the <br> capital exported by imperialism. Thus, feudalism predominates in the face of national capitalism and not <br> Faced with imperialist capitalism, which oppresses, subordinates and subjugates the Chinese nation. President Mao <br> Analyzes the social development of China, as follows, on the new democracy: <br> “(…) With its aggression against China, the imperialist powers, by one part, accelerated the <br> disintegration of Chinese feudal society and the growth of capitalism, thus converting <br> feudal society in semi -feudal, and, on the other hand, imposed on China their cruel domination, <br> transforming it from an independent country into a semicolonial and colonial country. ” (President Mao) 212 <br> The aggression of imperialist powers against China accelerate the growth of bureaucratic capitalism; you <br> Exported capital determined the accelerated conversion of feudal China to semi -feudal. However, <br> unlike the capitalist development process typical of the free competition stage, this <br> evolution of feudality and this growth of mercantile and capitalist relations, did not lead to a <br> higher national unification, on the contrary, converted China from an independent feudal country into a country <br> semicolonial and, therefore, colonial. <br> How can UOC (MLM) speak of subordination of the capitalist mode of production to the mode of <br> Feudal production in China? What happened was just the opposite, imperialism subordinated the forces <br> Feudal in China; funded, set up and directed the warlords against the democratic-bourgeois forces <br> Thus preventing the possibilities of development of Chinese national capitalism. This kind of <br> subordination, it was not a particular fact of Chinese society, but it became the general rule in the phase <br> imperialist of capitalism. President Mao summarizes “the means of military, political, economic and <br> cultural ”used by imperialist powers to gradually convert China into a semicolonia and, <br> Therefore, in Colony:<br>“1) They triggered numerous wars of aggression against China (…). <br> 2) Forced China to complete numerous unequal treaties (…). <br> 3) In this way, they were able to flood China with their goods, convert it into a market to <br> its industrial products and, at the same time, subordinate Chinese agricultural production to <br> imperialist needs. <br> 4) established numerous companies in the light and heavy industry in China to use it on the <br> land the raw materials and cheap labor, and in this environment exert economic pressure <br> direct about China's national industry and directly brakes the development of its <br> productive forces. <br> 5) (…) monopolized the banking system and finances of the country. <br> 6) In order to more easily explore the peasant masses and other layers of the population, they created <br> In China a network of exploration formed by buyers and merchants (…). <br> 7) They made the feudal landowner class of China, just as the buying bourgeoisie, <br> the pillar of its domination in China. (…). <br> 8) (…) raise intricate wars between military caudillos and repress the people. <br> 9) In addition, they never relaxed their efforts to fall asleep the spirit of the Chinese people. <br> 10) Since the incident of September 18, 1931, Japanese imperialism, with its invasion in Vasta <br> scale, converted much of the territory of China, which was already semicolonial, in a colony <br> Japanese. ” (President Mao) 213 <br><br><br> In the relationship of domination and colonial and semicolonial exploration, imperialism is the dominant aspect front <br> to the people and the Chinese nation. The imperialist powers make the feudal landlord and the bourgeoisie <br> Buying her pillars of domination in China. Therefore, it constitutes a falsification to attribute to the President <br> The conclusion is that in China the feudal mode of production subordinated the capitalist mode of production. <br> Both in the example of Marx, taken from the nineteenth century, and in the analysis of China made by President Mao, in the <br> Twentieth century, the capitalist mode of production is already the dominant aspect in the world economy. Marx shows, in <br> Capital, such as slave production relations in cotton production in the southern US, were already <br> Service of Mais-Valia production in England. Because to the extent that they secured a raw material <br> cheaper for the textile industry than the English cotom, or Indian or Egyptian cotton, cotton <br> produced by the blood of the blacks enslaved by the Ianques served a greater production of added value by <br> English bourgeoisie. In the twentieth century, what happens is that imperialism will not only chain these different <br> production relations in your service, how you will use all backward forces to ensure your <br> national domain. This is an indispensable condition to enable the profits with the capital <br> exported. Thus, through the unequal treaties, the subordination of agricultural production to <br> needs of imperialist powers, direct installation of imperialist companies that exploit the <br> raw material and the cheap labor force of the oppressed countries, through these means, the powers <br> Imperialists give a much larger profit than possible in the free competition stage. That's why <br> Lenin points out that increased national oppression is one of the results of the imperialist stage. <br> UOC (MLM) distorts President Mao's analyzes of Chinese society, confuses the prevalence of <br> semi -feudal production relations with the subordination of the capitalist mode of production to the mode of <br> feudal production, as it intends to present its proposition of socialist revolution to part of the countries <br> oppressed as being seated in Maoism. Thus presents China as a semi -feudal country and <br> semicolonial, as if semi -feudality were the dominant aspect of this social formation and as if in this <br> predominance was completely justification of the new democracy revolution. Therefore, it deduces that a <br> country in which semi -feudality no longer subordinates capitalist relations would need a revolution <br> immediately socialist. Thus links the revolution of new democracy solely and exclusively to the <br> swept of pre-capitalist production relations, and raises the national question in the scope of the revolution <br> socialist. <br> The falsehood of this reasoning consists of two points: 1) Imperialism has not swept semi -feudal relations, <br> It only evolved their forms by keeping them underlying; 2) The Revolution of New Democracy is not <br> summarizes the sweeping of semi -feudality, its most important international meaning is that it solves <br> full way the problem of the traffic revolution of national liberation to the socialist revolution, because <br> Its most important targets are feudalism and imperialism, and this is the main one. Let's see how <br> President Mao establishes the issue for the Chinese Revolution: <br> “Such are the characteristics of colonial, semicolonial and semi -feudal Chinese society. This situation<br>is mainly determined by the imperialist forces of Japan and other powers, and is the <br> result of the collusion between foreign imperialism and internal feudalism. The contradiction between the <br> imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the large popular masses, are <br> The fundamental contradictions of modern Chinese society. (…) But, of all these, the contradiction <br> between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the main one. ” (President Mao) 214 <br> Note a detail, President Mao in his definition of China's character always highlights the aspect <br> Semicolonial before the semi -feudal, the UOC (mlm) by refers to China always reverses the concepts by placing <br> in front the semi -feudal aspect to falsify the conclusion that this was the only determining characteristic of <br> Chinese society. The decisive importance of the struggle for the destruction of landlords in semicolonial countries is <br> precisely because this class is the main pillar of support of imperialism, and is the most <br> retrograde. Against it it is possible to unify most of the social classes of the country and a large number of forces <br> policies, a wide revolutionary front of the proletariat with the entire peasantry (poor, medium and <br> rich), the small urban bourgeoisie and even the average (national bourgeoisie) under certain conditions. <br> Only when an imperialist invasion occurs, it becomes possible to establish a single class front <br> Revolutionaries under the direction of the proletariat party, which is even broader. Therefore, in general, the <br> contradiction against semi -feudality is the main contradiction in the early stages of the new revolution <br> Democracy, but in no way constitutes the only contradiction to be resolved by this revolution. <br><br><br> Until the early 1940s, President Mao points out that the targets of the New Democracy Revolution <br> In China they were imperialism and feudalism. From the mid -1940s, particularly during the <br> Phase of the Third Revolutionary Civil War (1947-1949) always points out three targets: imperialism, the <br> feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism: <br> “Today, our main enemies are imperialism, feudalism and capitalism <br> bureaucratic, while the main forces in our struggle against these enemies are all <br> Manual and intellectual workers, representing 90 percent of the country's population. This is it <br> determines that our revolution in the current stage is, by its character, a democratic revolution <br> Popular, of new democracy, unlike a socialist revolution as the October Revolution. ” <br> (President Mao) 215 <br> This precautionary of President Mao's position is the result of the ideological development of the <br> Maoism, as a reflection of the transformations of China and the World in the course and after World War II. O <br> development of industrial production in countries dominated by imperialism is a present tendency <br> Throughout the twentieth century, which alternated periods of boost and setback. Resulting from <br> EXPORT OF CAPITALS, as we saw in the analysis above President Mao, imperialism has been implemented <br> companies in their colonies and semicolonies to more easily explore the raw materials present there <br> and overexplorate the available workforce. However, due to the interimperialist contradictions <br> (particularly during the I and II GM), according to the contradiction socialism versus capitalism, according to <br> contradiction nations and oppressed peoples versus imperialism and the proletariat contradiction versus bourgeoisie <br> worldwide, imperialism was also forced to intertwine with large local capital of <br> countries oppressed to develop capitalist companies in the semicolonies. Due to its weakness <br> economic in the face of imperialist financial capital, the large semicolonial capital to intertwine to this, <br> It had to do so, mainly, through the state. Bureaucratic capitalism in semicolonial countries <br> emerges as a non-state monopolistic capitalism, but when developing uses the control of the old <br> state machine and becomes state monopolistic capitalism, state -owned but privately <br> content, engendered and linked to imperialism, resulting in the differentiation of two fractions from this great <br> bourgeoisie, the buyer, first form of the great bourgeoisie in the oppressed countries and the bureaucratic <br> itself, resulting from this differentiation within the state. In China this process intensifies the <br> From 1945, with the defeat and expulsion of Japanese imperialism, when Chiang Kai-Shek, ahead <br> of the old state machine and leveraged by the financial capital Yankee, drives this capitalism <br> State monopolist. This process did not only occur in China, it occurred as an immediate consequence of the <br> advent of imperialism, in all countries that were more late and became colonies or<br>semicolonies of different imperialist powers, a phenomenon that was a rule in the monopolistic phase of the <br> capital. The class struggle in this process and the struggle of two lines in Marxism led, in a sequence, for <br> Lenin, Stalin and President Mao resulted in the development of the theory on New Revolution <br> Democracy in China, whose targets to be destroyed and removed are feudalism, imperialism and <br> bureaucratic capitalism, the three mountains of exploitation and oppression of the popular masses and subjugation of <br> nation. <br> Reduce the revolution of new democracy to the vanishing of feudalism, would correspond to reduce it to <br> Agrarian Revolution, this would be a falsification of Maoism. State that imperialism in alliance with <br> bourgeois latifier dictatorships of the semicolonies would have solved the agrarian and peasant problem is the <br> expression of the most childish revisionist illusion with imperialism and the great bourgeoisie. After all, like the <br> President Mao points out that: <br> “(…) [The path of bourgeois dictatorship at the time of imperialism to oppressed countries] <br> impractical. The international situation is today characterized fundamentally by the struggle between the <br> Capitalism and socialism and the decline of capitalism and the rise of socialism. In first <br> place, international capitalism or imperialism will not allow it to be established in our country <br> a capitalist society of bourgeois dictatorship. The modern history of China is precisely <br> history of imperialist aggression against it, of the imperialist opposition to its independence and the <br> development of your capitalism. (…) It is certain that we live in the last sighs of the <br> imperialism, which is about to die; Imperialism is 'agonizing capitalism'. But, <br> precisely because it is about to die, it depends even more on the colonies and semicolonies and not <br> will allow at all that in none of them a capitalist society of <br> bourgeois dictatorship. Precisely because Japanese imperialism is sunk in a serious crisis <br> economic and political, that is, because it is about to die, it has to invade China and convert it to <br><br><br> colony, thus closing the way to the bourgeois dictatorship and the development of the <br> national capitalism. ” (President Mao) 216 <br> UOC's direction (MLM) is against these conclusions of President Mao, but does not say openly. Prefers <br> hide its divergence to sell its theory as a maleist that a part of the countries oppressed by the <br> imperialism, in the course of the twentieth century, developed in capitalist society of bourgeois dictatorship, as <br> result of the “progressive” tendency of imperialism. Maoism affirms the opposite: imperialism has closed the <br> Way to the national development of oppressed countries; after all as Lenin establishes: “ <br> political particularities of imperialism are the reaction throughout the line and the intensification of oppression <br> national ”217. UOC's position (MLM) on imperialism sweeping pre-capitalist production modes and <br> On such oppressed capitalist countries there is nothing of Leninism, nor of Maoism. <br> 3- Trotskyist analysis of the bourgeoisie in the countries oppressed by imperialism <br> Nothing easier than criticizing, in general, the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries. A weak bourgeoisie <br> economically, politically dubious, unable to direct their own bourgeois revolution, conciliating with the <br> imperialism and with the landlord, fearful of the proletarian revolution, claudicating in support of the struggle for the land of <br> peasants. All of these qualifiers are true. However, as a rule, the more <br> high and generic are criticism of the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries, the most superficial is the analysis of <br> classes of said societies. The history of the proletarian revolution in the twentieth century, especially in the countries <br> oppressed, serves as proof of the brutal error of considering the bourgeoisie worldwide and, even in <br> A given country, like a unique block, without internal differences. <br> UOC (MLM), for example, states that “it is incorrect to always presuppose and without analysis of the class structure, <br> the existence of a national bourgeoisie in the oppressed countries ”. States this, because it concludes that in such countries <br> Oppressed capitalists there is no national bourgeoisie, there is only the local section of the world bourgeoisie; <br> There is no Lacaia bourgeoisie, but an international society of bourgeois who oppress <br> SET the proletariat of all countries. For UOC (mlm), this way: <br> “(…) The economic independence of the country is contradicted with its class interests, since it is not <br> be a simple employee in imperialist capitalist businesses: it is a partner and partitime of the system <br> world of imperialism ”, including the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries“ gets an equal profit rate <br> to the bourgeoisie of other countries ”. [UOC (MLM)] 218 <br> Wrap everything and simply disregard the existence, in the countries oppressed by imperialism,<br>a wide layer of small and medium bourgeois that exploit the proletariat, but at the same time <br> They have contradiction with imperialism and the great bourgeoisie of these countries. In your program, do not <br> even a distinction between large bourgeoisie and medium bourgeoisie in Colombia. For UOC (MLM) there is <br> Only the bourgeoisie, which is a partner and participant of the Unit Society of the World Bourgeoisie. All this speech <br> “Antiburgue” may sound as revolutionary, as “left”, but there is nothing scientific, because <br> no way corresponds to a concrete analysis of the concrete situation of the world's oppressed countries, <br> particularly from Latin America. <br> The existence of this intermediate layer, of these small owners who exploit wage labor <br> but at the same time they need to work on their own businesses, it is an extremely <br> present in al. The huge service sector present in all these economies, of which much is <br> To small and medium owners, it is the patent expression of this reality. DISCONDER IT, CLASSING IT <br> only as proletarians-owners or as great bourgeois, it only serves to circumvent the problem <br> instead of solving it. This is a very important mass that has become the basis of fascist ideas, <br> as has happened other times in history and needs to be disputed by the communists who must present a <br> Program corresponding to the character of the necessary revolution the transformation of these societies. Lenin, about <br> This question stated that: <br> “What is all this scam from Martínov? Which confuses the democratic revolution with the <br> socialist revolution, which forgets the role of the intermediate layer, the existing popular layer <br> between the 'bourgeoisie' and the 'proletariat' (the small bourgeois mass of the poor of the city and the countryside, the <br><br><br> 'Semi -proletarians', the small owners); it is due to the one that does not understand the true meaning of <br> our minimum program. ” (Lenin) 219 <br> UOC (MLM) even refers to the semi -proletarians and small owners, but totally forgets the <br> rest of the intermediate layer and completely disregards the need for a minimum program to <br> The revolution, that is, of a program of new democracy. In Russia, the liberal bourgeoisie was all <br> reactionary, so the lenial tactic established since 1905 was to make a bourgeois revolution against the <br> bourgeoisie. However, this was not the same condition as the countries oppressed by imperialism, which <br> precisely due to this oppression, it contained particularities in the local bourgeoisie that differentiated it from <br> bourgeoisie in imperialist countries. Stalin deals with this issue in decisive debates in the 1920s against the <br> Trotskism about the IC line for the Chinese Revolution: <br> “The fundamental error of the opposition is that it identifies the 1905 revolution in Russia, country <br> imperialist who oppressed other peoples, with the revolution in China, the oppressed, semicolonial country, <br> Thank you to fight the imperialist oppression of other states. Here, in Russia, the revolution was going <br> directed against the bourgeoisie, against the liberal bourgeoisie, although the revolution was a <br> Democratic-bourgeois revolution. Why? Because the liberal bourgeoisie of an imperialist country <br> It may stop being counterrevolutionary. Precisely for this reason, the Bolsheviks did not put themselves <br> So they could not even put the question of the blocks and temporary agreements with the liberal bourgeoisie. ” <br> (Stalin) 220 <br> And establishing the guidelines for the general line of the revolution in the oppressed countries, the comrade Stalin <br> underlies the question in this way: <br> “Revolution in imperialist countries is one thing: in them, the bourgeoisie is the oppressive of other peoples; <br> In them, the bourgeoisie is counterrevolutionary in all phases of the revolution; in them the national factor is missing <br> as a factor of liberating struggle. Revolution in colonies and dependent countries is something else; on them, <br> The imperialist oppression of other states is one of the factors of the revolution; in them, this oppression does not <br> It can at least fail to affect the national bourgeoisie; in them, in a certain phase and <br> For a certain period, the bourgeoisie can support the revolutionary movement of its <br> country against imperialism; in them, the national factor, as a factor of the struggle for liberation, is a factor of <br> revolution. Do not make this distinction, not understand this difference, identify the revolution in countries <br> imperialists with the revolution in the colonies, all of this means to deviate from the Marxist path, from the path <br> Leninist and be on the way to the supporters of the II International. ” (Stalin) 221 <br> The Founding Parties and Organizations of the LCI we are in the sender of the Communist International with the <br> great developments brought by Maoism and therefore we defend the banner of the universality of <br> Revolution of new democracy for countries oppressed by imperialism. Because the main task<br>of these revolutions is to defeat the imperialist domination imposed on colonial countries and <br> semicolonials. It was President Mao who, applying the line of the communist international to the revolution <br> of colonial and semicolonial countries, which, when directing the first victorious revolution in an oppressed country, <br> He has developed this theory, establishing the formulation of the New Democracy Revolution. O <br> Maoism develops the understanding of the particularities of the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries, tracing <br> within these countries the distinction between large bourgeoisie and medium bourgeoisie. Part of the great bourgeoisie, <br> which is Lacaia of imperialism, can turn against a particular imperialist power, such as Chiang <br> Kai-Shek in the anti-japanese war, but never against all imperialism. The average or genuine average <br> national bourgeoisie, in turn, has contradictions with both the great bourgeoisie and the imperialism, <br> because both restrict their profits, as they are monopolistic bourgeoisie. The imperialist bourgeoisie is imposed <br> by the gigantic magnitude of its capital and the condition that its states dominate politics and <br> militarily the oppressed peoples and nations; the great bourgeoisie of the semicolonial countries, in addition to the power of <br> Their capitals dominate and control the state machinery of their countries. As monopolistic bourgeoisie, <br> They make super students at the expense of overexploitation of the proletariat, but also for restricting and limiting the rate <br> of profit from the medium bourgeoisie and the small bourgeoisie. This is the economic base of the contradiction of the bourgeoisie <br> national with imperialism. However, this same national bourgeoisie, in addition to suffering the competition <br> unequal in the national market with imported goods, also depends on the sale of part of their <br> goods and services for the great bourgeoisie and for imperialism itself. Depends on numerous roads <br> both and for its contradiction with the proletariat that explores fears the proletarian revolution, and is unstable in <br> New Democracy Revolution. Therefore, the national bourgeoisie is invariably hesitant, the proletariat does not <br> must count on it as a safe ally, but it is indispensable to establish a minimum program that <br><br><br> contemplate your interests, particularly the guarantee of your property and market for your goods, <br> to unite the maximum forces to defeat semi -feudality and imperialism. Applying the line of <br> Comrade Stalin, President Mao analyzes that: <br> “The Chinese national bourgeoisie, because it belongs to a colonial and semicolonial country and is oppressed by the <br> imperialism, still has in certain periods and to some extent a revolutionary character, including <br> time of imperialism, in the sense that opposes foreign imperialists and the governments of <br> bureaucrats and military caudillos of the country, as witness to the 1911 revolution and the expedition to <br> North, and can ally with the proletariat and the small bourgeoisie against the enemies that <br> It matters to fight. In this differentiates the Chinese bourgeoisie of the bourgeoisie of the old russian tsarist. <br> As the latter was already an imperialist military power, an aggressive state, its bourgeoisie <br> had no revolutionary character. There the duty of the proletariat was to fight the bourgeoisie, and <br> Do not ally with this. In turn, given that China is a colonial and semicolonial country, <br> Aggression, its national bourgeoisie has in certain periods and to some extent a revolutionary character. <br> Here, the proletariat has a duty not to go through this revolutionary character of the bourgeoisie <br> national and form with this a single front against imperialism and the governments of bureaucrats and <br> military caudillos. ” (President Mao) 222 <br> And develops the position of the International clearly delimiting the distinction between the national bourgeoisie and the <br> great bourgeoisie in the countries oppressed by imperialism: <br> “But at the same time, precisely because it belongs to a colonial and semicolonial country and being, <br> consequently, extremely weak in the economic and political land, the national bourgeoisie <br> Chinese also has another character, that is, its tendency to conciliation with the enemies of <br> revolution. Even at times when participating in the revolution, it is reluctant to break completely <br> with imperialism; in addition, it is closely linked to the exploration that is exercised in the field <br> through the lease of the earth. So it doesn't even want to completely defeat the <br> imperialism and even less feudal forces. Thus, it is not able to solve either of the two <br> Fundamental problems of the Democratic-Bourgue Revolution of China. Already the great bourgeoisie <br> Chinese, represented by the Kuomintang, surrendered with open arms to imperialism and <br> confated with feudal forces to combat the revolutionary people during the long period of <br> 1927 to 1937. ” (President Mao) 223 <br> President Mao concludes, therefore, that the national bourgeoisie, to some extent, has a character<br>revolutionary and at the same time tends to conciliation with the enemies of the revolution. Differently, the <br> great bourgeoisie surrender with open arms to imperialism and combines with feudal forces to combat <br> the people. The New Democracy Revolution also targets the great bourgeoisie, capitalism <br> Bureaucratic, but preserves private property of the medium and small bourgeoisie, as well as other rights of them. <br> This was well established by President Mao with six Single Front Laws. This is the development <br> made by Maoism, in the analysis of social classes in the oppressed countries, particularly about how <br> Understand your bourgeoisie and fractions. <br> For UOC (MLM), in such oppressed capitalist countries there is only the bourgeoisie in general and this is so allied of <br> imperialist bourgeoisie that becomes a partner at the world bourgeoisie club and compare with this the same rate <br> of profit. Moreover, they claim to exist only monopolistic bourgeoisie, that of local and foreign origin, and in <br> Case of some of these countries, they claim to be both imperialist. About Colombia, they claim that: <br> “The so -called national bourgeoisie not only does not exist today in Colombian society, but those <br> who play the role of their spokesman, are actually erasing fireworks from class struggle, <br> conciliators impertinent with the hated enemies of the people. ” [UOC (MLM)] 224 <br> State that the national bourgeoisie does not exist in Colombia and say that the alleged representatives of this <br> nonexistent class would be conciliators with the enemies of the people. Reconciling with the enemies of the people this is the <br> typical characteristic of the national bourgeoisie. However, this does not remove it the revolutionary role that can <br> comply with, particularly during periods when imperialist aggressions occur to the national territory, <br> either by the development of the revolution in a given country, or by the aggravation of contradictions <br> interimperialists. <br><br><br> The proletarian revolution in the countries dominated by imperialism requires the new democracy stage. In the age of <br> imperialism and the proletarian revolution, the bourgeois democratic tasks pending in these countries can only <br> be resolved by the democratic revolution of a new type, that is, directed by the proletariat and what <br> uninterruptedly to socialism. Stand against the importance of the struggle for the land of peasants in <br> revolution in these countries, rising against the importance of neutralizing the intermediate layers, among <br> This is the national bourgeoisie, for the democratic revolution, particularly in its national release phase <br> oppose the maoism and assume the rotten Trotskyist program for colonial and semicolonial countries: <br> “For the countries of retarding bourgeois development and, in particular, for colonial countries and <br> semicolonials, the theory of permanent revolution means that the true and complete solution of <br> their democratic and national-liberators are conceivable only through the dictatorship of the <br> Proletariat, which assumes the direction of the oppressed nation and, first and foremost, its peasant masses. ” <br> (Trotsky) 225 <br> This is the false left -handed position carried out by Trotsky, of wanting to resolve the democratic, national and <br> Peasant, immediately by the dictatorship of the proletariat. The characterization of UOC (MLM) on the bourgeoisie <br> national because this same essence. <br> 4- The Revolution of New Democracy and the National Question <br> UOC defense (MLM) about the immediate socialist revolution in semicolonial countries obeys <br> Next logic: “Greater premise: resulting from the progressive tendency of imperialism that sweeps the ways <br> Pre-Capitalist production '”arises in the world oppressed capitalist countries; minor premise: like the <br> Revolution of New Democracy aims to eliminate semi -feudality, therefore: the revolution in “capitalist countries <br> oppressed ”must be immediately socialist. Both the premises and the conclusion of this theory are <br> completely false. First, there is no progressive tendency for imperialism. How it highlights the <br> President Mao, the objective of exporting capital of imperialist powers is not to develop the <br> Capitalism, but colonially subjugate the oppressed countries. Secondly, the theory of revolution <br> of new democracy aims at the destruction of imperialist domination, feudality and capitalism <br> bureaucratic; therefore, even if hypothetically there was no semi -semudality in a given country <br> semicolonial, because it is oppressed by imperialism its revolution must necessarily be a <br> Uninterrupted democratic revolution to socialism. Because this revolution invariably implies a war <br> Civil against the great bourgeoisie and the landlord and a national war against imperialist domination. <br> However, UOC (MLM) has a completely distorted understanding of the content of the <br> Revolution of new democracy, in addition to reducing the objectives of it exclusively to the agrarian revolution,<br>points out that one of its objectives would be to “develop capitalism”, unlike the “revolution <br> socialist ”who would be intended to“ abolish ”“ capitalism ”. In addition, it eliminates the liberation character <br> national of such “oppressed capitalist countries”, opposing “socialist anti-imperialism” to the struggle <br> democratic for the national sovereignty of colonial and semicolonial countries. The question is like this in your <br> Program: <br> “The content of the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement in this era and in capitalist countries <br> Oppressed is no longer democratic bourgeois of liberation and becomes socialist (…). <br> Continue considering that also in these countries the anti-imperialist movement has content <br> democratic, which does not shock with the national base of the power of capital, but it favors <br> its development, and as such it requires a stage prior to the socialist revolution, is to solve the <br> problem in the way a semi -feudal country ”. [UOC (MLM)] 226 <br> That is, for UOC (MLM) in a semi-feudal country, the democratic stage prior to the socialist stage is justified, <br> In this case, the anti-imperialist content of the revolution is democratic-bourgeois of liberation and, therefore, the <br> revolution does not clash with the national base of capital power, but on the contrary it favors its <br> development. How can an organization say to be maleist to present the content of the <br> Revolution of new democracy developed by President Mao? How can you summarize this <br> Way the meaning of the democratic stage of the socialist revolution formulated by the great Lenin? Not that <br> passes from cheap falsification to justify the old Trotskyist “theory” of the “permanent revolution” in countries <br> oppressed by imperialism. <br><br><br> For Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, national liberation is a bourgeois democratic flag <br> abandoned by the bourgeoisie of advanced countries still in the late nineteenth century and which, in the twentieth century in <br> Given, it cannot be sustained consequently by the national bourgeoisie itself of the oppressed countries. <br> This was the advent of imperialism, the passage of capital to its monopolistic and last stage, which marks the end <br> from the time of the world bourgeois democratic revolution and opens the time of the world proletarian revolution, <br> occurring the great socialist revolution of October and the passage of the bourgeoisie as a social class <br> historical for counterrevolution. But even though the democratic revolution is a bourgeois revolution, under <br> The direction and hegemony of the proletariat, supported by the worker-pampon covenant, it becomes a revolution <br> Bourgeois democratic of a new type or revolution of new uninterrupted democracy to the socialist revolution. <br> Consequently the struggle for national liberation there surpasses its bourgeois content, ceases to belong to <br> a narrow nationalism and assumes internationalist content, as it fights against the national oppression of <br> all peoples and not just their people. Thus assumes proletarian and not nationalist bourgeois content, <br> and part of the world proletarian revolution. <br> Similarly, although the revolution of new democracy, in destroying feudality, imperialism, and <br> bureaucratic capitalism, clear the way to the development of capitalism in a particular <br> country, as it destroys the monopolistic property of the means of production and allows growth <br> of the small and medium property, favoring the development of capitalism is not an objective <br> of the democratic revolution of a new type, since it is under the joint dictatorship of revolutionary classes under <br> direction and hegemony of the proletariat. After all, the purpose of the New Democracy Revolution is to pass <br> uninterruptedly to the socialist revolution; establish the dictatorship of the proletariat and promote the construction <br> of socialism; This is the main task and objective of the New Democracy Revolution. Let's see how <br> President Mao establishes the question: <br> “In its first stage or first step, the revolution of a colonial or semicolonial country, still <br> that by its social character follows being fundamentally democratic-bourgeois and its claims <br> objectively tend to clear the way to the development of capitalism, it is no longer a <br> old type revolution, directed by the bourgeoisie and intended to establish a capitalist society and <br> a state of bourgeois dictatorship, but a new type revolution, directed by the proletariat and <br> designed to establish, in this first stage, a society of new democracy and a state of <br> joint dictatorship of all revolutionary classes. Therefore, this revolution opens precisely <br> An even broader path to the development of socialism. During your course, <br> crosses several phases due to changes in the opposite field and among its own allies, but its <br> fundamental character remains unchanged. Such revolution consequently fights the <br> imperialism and therefore this does not tolerate it and fights it. ” (President Mao) 227<br>President Mao is unmistakably clear: the claims of the first phase of the revolution in countries <br> Semicolonials tend to clear the way to the development of capitalism. This is a trend <br> inevitable, but it is not at all the content of this phase, because it is no longer a revolution <br> bourgeois of old type. Therefore, the objective of the democratic stage of the revolution is: to open the way to the <br> development of socialism. The new democracy revolution has phases, but its fundamental character <br> remains unchanged; What character is this? The proletarian character, so imperialism does not tolerate it and struggles <br> against her. To say that the purpose of the new democracy revolution is to favor the development of <br> capitalism, means converging with the rotten falsification of Liu Shao-Chi about the democratic revolution in <br> China and with directism in which, in the past, the various communist parties in the oppressed countries <br> they sank with the tale that the purpose of the democratic revolution was to develop capitalism, <br> General and the agrarian revolution was to develop capitalism in the countryside, in particular. These parties that <br> in its rotting, since the collapse of the revisionist and social-imperialist USSR, many of them <br> concluded exactly that the character of the revolution in their countries was already socialist, because they became <br> countries of dependent capitalism. <br> President Mao, in his speech pronounced in a framework conference (1948), establishes that the <br> Revolution of new democracy is a “revolution against imperialism, feudalism and capitalism <br> bureaucratic, supported by the large masses of the people under the direction of the proletariat ”228. That is, in the stage <br> democratic, in addition to the confiscation of the landlords by delivering land portions to poor peasants <br> Without or with little land, all imperialist and bureaucratic capital is expropriated, <br> State of New Democracy All imperialist industries and the great local bourgeoisie. That is, socialize the <br> most important part of industry, transport, large commerce companies, services and <br><br><br> Banks in the country, in addition to external business. Given this, how can UOC (mlm) say that the revolution <br> of new democracy “does not shock the national base of capital power”? This is a forgery <br> inadmissible, it is a borderfish rejection of one of the fundamental theories of Maoism that gave the solution to <br> problems of the revolution for the vast majority of countries in the world, for the vast majority of masses <br> Popular Earth! What is maoism in this? <br> And after completely cheering the Maoist content of the New Democracy Revolution, UOC (MLM) concludes <br> that this is the way to solve the national issue "in the way of a semi -feudal country." Reinforces your <br> understanding that the revolution of new democracy is only in force due to semi -feudality, <br> completely disregarding national oppression and national liberation struggle as a task <br> Bourgeois democratic. The falsehood of this point of view, it proves in the quotation above, when the President <br> Mao specifies the need for “a first step or first step” in the “revolution of a country <br> colonial or semicolonial ”. President Mao emphasizes the aspect of imperialist oppression and not oppression <br> Feudal as the distinctive question between the New Democracy Revolution and the Socialist Revolution. <br> In this way, UOC (mlm) completely confuses what the bourgeois revolution is and what is the revolution <br> Agrarian-Camponess, he takes each other and completely disregards that the fight against national oppression <br> and against bureaucratic capitalism are democratic tasks to be fulfilled in the first stage of <br> Socialist Revolution in the colonial and semicolonial countries. This same falseation was faced by Lenin <br> in the fight of two lines against the Mensheviks after the Russian Revolution of 1905: <br> “Every peasant revolution directed against medieval reminiscences - when the <br> character of the whole social economy - it is a bourgeois revolution. But not every bourgeois revolution <br> It is a peasant revolution. (…) In other words: a bourgeois country is possible without peasantry <br> And in such a country, a bourgeois revolution is possible without the peasantry. It is possible <br> bourgeois revolution in a country with considerable peasant population and that, however, this <br> revolution is not peasant, on the contrary it is so that it does not revolutionize relations <br> agrarian that affect in particular to peasants and not highlight these social forces by the <br> Less active, executors of the revolution. (…) The fundamental origin of the erroneous character of the whole <br> Plekhanov's tactical line and the followed by them, in the first period of the revolution <br> Russian (that is, in the years 1905-1907), it is based on which they did not understand this <br> Correlation between the bourgeois revolution in general and the peasant bourgeois revolution. ” (Lenin) 229<br>The Revolution of New Democracy, by its social characteristics, is a democratic-bourgeois revolution <br> again, that is, performs necessary democratic tasks under the direction of the proletariat, which reaches the <br> hegemony by combining the peasantry through its proletarian agrarian program and passes <br> uninterrupted to socialist revolution and construction. The peasant revolution is one of its most <br> Important, but it is not the only one. Present the democratic revolution as a peasant revolution, does not pass <br> UOC Sophism (MLM) to smuggle to Maoism and thus want to sustain the old woman on behalf <br> Thesis of the immediate socialist revolution in the countries oppressed by imperialism. Lenin is very clear in <br> their historical analysis: the current peasant revolutions are necessarily bourgeois revolutions, because the <br> which is at the center of the peasant's struggle is the right to individual private property of the earth. In turn, <br> Not every bourgeois revolution is necessarily a peasant revolution; That is, a certain revolution <br> You will not lose your bourgeois character just for not having the peasant participation. Likewise, the <br> national liberation revolution would not fail to have a democratic-bourgeois character for the hypothetical fact of <br> There is no more peasant issue in an oppressed country. This is because the national liberation struggle in <br> imperialist stage of capitalism remains a bourgeois task, although it can only be led to <br> victory under the direction of the proletariat and advanced uninterruptedly to socialism. <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) seeks to equal absolutely the anti-imperialist struggle to the struggle of liberation <br> national. The entire international proletarian movement is anti-imperialist, because in the stage of capital <br> Monopolist, fighting capitalism is fighting imperialism. The particularity of this struggle in countries <br> oppressed by imperialism is that in these the anti-imperialist struggle assumes a democratic character of <br> National liberation, but for UOC (MLM) thus conceiving the question is an “anti -cinned” attitude: <br> “The problem is how to scientifically understand the relationship between the struggle against imperialism <br> foreigner and the struggle for socialism in an oppressed country. (…) And in this case, in which the proletariat <br> has its purpose directly in socialism, the struggle against imperialism fully coincides with <br><br><br> the general internationalist character of the proletarian struggle, ceasing to be a democratic struggle for <br> defend the bourgeois nation, and becoming an anti -capitalist struggle for determining the world the <br> imperialism." [UOC (MLM)] 230 <br> That is, for the direction of UOC (MLM), in the struggle for socialism in a country oppressed the fight against the <br> imperialism is no longer a national democratic struggle, it becomes only a social struggle of work against <br> The capital of the workers (combining at most with the poor peasants) against the world bourgeoisie. This <br> There is nothing of Leninism, no Maoism. As the great Lenin establishes: <br> “Every war is the continuation of politics by other means. The national wars of the colonies against <br> imperialism will inevitably be a continuation of the national liberation policy of <br> same. ” (Lenin) 231 <br> And still: <br> “Those who expect the 'pure' social revolution will never see it. Will be a word revolutionary, who <br> does not understand the true revolution. ” (Lenin) 232 <br> For Leninism no revolution will be socially “pure” from a social class against another social class. <br> The revolutions in the colonies against imperialism, by its character, are for Lenin, inevitably, <br> national revolutions and by, its political content, bourgeois revolutions, but bourgeois again, <br> New democracy, as President Mao develops. The anti-imperialist struggle in the countries oppressed by the <br> imperialism, therefore, has a social character (being the revolutionary classes: the proletariat - strength <br> leader - the peasantry - main ally, the small urban bourgeoisie and, under certain circumstances <br> the national bourgeoisie or medium bourgeoisie), has a national character (as it is the struggle of an oppressed nation <br> against an oppressive power) and has a bourgeois political character, because the nation's defense is a task <br> bourgeois pendant, which does not suppress the ownership of the means of production as a whole, but only the <br> large local and foreign monopolistic bourgeoisie, which concentrates private property of the fundamental <br> means of production, because the proletarian revolution is invariably internationalist. About the content <br> Democratic of the national liberation struggle, at the time of imperialism, Lenin states that: <br> “Another thing happens in unvasive countries (…), that is, in the east of Europe and in all <br> colonies and semicolonies. There is however and as a rule generally oppressed and unveloped nations <br> from the point of view of capitalism. In such nations there are, however, objectively tasks<br>General, namely: democratic tasks, tasks of defeat of the foreign yoke. ” <br> (Lenin) 233 <br> In the oppressed nations, therefore, the anti-imperialist struggle is not limited to a social struggle, they converge in it <br> Democratic and national elements that are essential for the victory of the revolution. Despise these <br> Elements is to conduct the proletariat to defeat. Differences and convergences between war <br> civil revolutionary and the revolutionary national war, was brilliantly treated by President Mao in the <br> elaboration of the highest military theory of the proletariat, that of the prolonged popular war in the new revolution <br> Uninterrupted democracy to the socialist revolution in China. Let's see: <br> “The central task and the highest form of the whole revolution is the seizure of power through the struggle <br> Armed, that is, the solution of the problem through war. This revolutionary Marxist principle <br> Leninist has universal validity, both in China and in other countries. <br> However, in view of the same principle, the party of the proletariat applies it in a distinct form <br> according to the conditions. In capitalist countries, when they are neither fascist nor <br> are at war, the conditions are as follows: in the internal, there is no feudal system, but the <br> bourgeois democracy; outside, these countries do not suffer national oppression, but they <br> They even oppress other nations. <br> The case of China is different. The particularity of China is that it is not an independent country and <br> Democratic, if not semicolonial and semi -feudal, where there is no democracy, but feudal oppression. (…) <br> Here the fundamental task of the Communist Party does not consist of going through a long period of struggle <br> legal before undertaking the survey and the war, not even to seize the cities first and soon <br> Occupy the field, but do it in the reverse way. <br><br><br> When imperialists do not carry out armed attacks against our country, the Communist Party of <br> China, or sustains a civil war against the military caudillos (lacnacios of imperialism) combining <br> with the bourgeoisie, such as wars in Kwangtung and in the northern expedition that occurred between 1924 and <br> 1927, or joins with the peasants and the small urban bourgeoisie to support a war <br> civil against the landlord class and the buying bourgeoisie (also lackeys of imperialism), <br> like the agrarian revolutionary war of 1927-1936. But when imperialists launch attacks <br> armed against China, the party then unites with all the classes and social layers of the country that <br> oppose foreign aggressors to undertake a national war against the enemy <br> exterior, like the current war of resistance against Japan. ” (President Mao) 234 <br> One of the many great contributions of President Mao to the military theory of the proletariat, is in the particularity <br> by him discovering that the proletarian revolution in oppressed countries develops sometimes as a war <br> Revolutionary civilian, sometimes as a revolutionary national war. That is, in the different phases why <br> pass this type of revolution, change the conditions of war according to the main contradiction being <br> of a civil war or a national war. In the case of the Chinese Revolution, in the First Civil War <br> Revolutionary (1924-1927), the proletariat and the poor peasants allied with the small urban bourgeoisie and <br> the national bourgeoisie in the fight against the Northern military caudillos and imperialist domination; on Monday <br> Revolutionary Civil War (1927-1936), the proletariat was allied only with the peasants and the <br> small urban bourgeoisie in the fight against landowners; already in the war of national resistance against the <br> Japan (1937-1945), the proletariat was allied with all the classes and social layers that opposed <br> occupation of Japanese imperialism. <br> President Mao points out that understanding these changes in the characteristics of revolutionary war is <br> fundamental to your correct direction. Shows how the laws of war change as they change <br> Characteristics of revolutionary war, that is, if it is a civil war or a national war: <br> “Thus, the laws of the direction of war change due to the conditions of war, that is, the <br> time, place and character. In relation to the time factor, both the war and the laws of its <br> direction develop. Each historical stage has its characteristics and, therefore, the laws of <br> war in each historical stage has its characteristics and cannot be transposed <br> mechanically from one step to another. ” (President Mao) 235 <br> And so, President Mao reschedules the modifications of the laws of revolutionary war as this is a <br> civil war or a national war: <br> “In China, the Armed Revolution fights armed counterrevolution. This is one of the <br> particularities and one of the advantages of the Chinese revolution. This thesis of Comrade Stalin is <br> entirely correct, and valid for both the North Expedition and the War of Resistance<br>against Japan. All of these are revolutionary wars, directed to combat the counterrevolution and <br> In them, mainly, the revolutionary people participate. The only differences between them are the same <br> that exist between a civil war and a national war, between a war sustained only <br> by the Communist Party and a war held together by Kuomitang and the Party <br> Communist. It is clear that these differences are important because they indicate the amplitude of the force <br> principal of war (whether it is an alliance of the workers and the peasants or an alliance of the workers, <br> of the peasants and the bourgeoisie) and the target to which the war is directed (if against an internal enemy <br> or an outer enemy, and in the first case, if against the Northern Military Grounds or against the <br> Kuomitang); also indicate that China's revolutionary war has content <br> different in the different stages of its historical development. All are revolutionary wars, <br> And all show the peculiarities and advantages of the Chinese revolution. The main task of the party of <br> China's proletariat, a task that has practically before its emergence, is to unite <br> with as many allies as possible and organize the armed struggle to combat, according to the <br> circumstances, the internal or external armed counterrevolution, and to achieve the national liberation and <br> Social." (President Mao) 236 <br> President Mao highlights precisely the decisive importance of taking the difference in the content of the war <br> revolutionary in its different phases; It highlights as both Civil War and the National War directed <br> by the Communist Party identify themselves because they are revolutionary wars, but have great differences <br> regarding the breadth of revolutionary forces and the targets against which each of these types of <br> Revolutionary war is headed. After all, as President Mao synthesizes, shortly before the beginning of the <br> War of national resistance against Japan: <br><br><br> “If the Red Army of China, during the agrarian revolutionary war, was able to win <br> Often battles with small forces, it was largely because it had pasta <br> organized and armed popular. Of course, the National War must gain support <br> even broader popular than agrarian revolutionary war. ” (President Mao) 237 <br> Take the different phases of development of revolutionary war in the semicolonial countries, <br> understanding that one of the particularities of the popular war in these countries is that it is <br> It develops now as a revolutionary civil war sometimes as a revolutionary national war. To understand <br> that the laws of revolutionary war change from one phase to another, as the targets and <br> forces in struggle. Understand that a revolutionary national war allows you to unite more strength and greater support <br> Popular than the internal civil war are great contributions from Maoism to the international proletariat. At the <br> However, UOC (MLM) despises all this ideological development, as they claim that: <br> “Whatever the particularities, the capitalist character of a society in an oppressed country <br> By imperialism, they require an anti-imperialist movement, not in a separate stage (…). ” And still: <br> “Neither nationalism, nor patriotic, nor national sovereignty, are flags of the movement <br> factory worker; On the contrary, they are old and flags of the bourgeoisie and the small bourgeoisie. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 238 <br> In denying the phases in the process of developing revolutionary war in the oppressed countries, the <br> UOC Directorate (MLM) only reveals its tergiversation of the law of contradiction, because according to the President <br> Mao establishes: Every process of developing one thing has steps and phases. When they merge phases <br> qualitatively distinct from the prolonged popular war, they apply the rotten philosophy of “integrating two in one”, <br> Typical of Prachanda. By denying the need for revolutionary national war for countries <br> Semicolonials, repeat the rotten “national nihilism” defended by revisionist Avakian. When they watched <br> against the flag of national sovereignty by launching the accusation “bourgeois-mounted flags, they express <br> Only the little bourgeois, childish, childish and trotskyist “left” “left”; so it is <br> evident that the flag of national sovereignty is bourgeois, but it is a flag that was abandoned by the <br> bourgeoisie with the advent of imperialism and it is up to the proletariat to take it in his hands to drive from <br> consequently the national liberation movement. Therefore, it is not about powerful flags, because <br> They are on the agenda and are essential for the advancement of the world proletarian revolution. Because how <br> defines the great Lenin: <br> “In the program of our party, adopted in March of the current year, we say, when characterizing the <br> approximation of the social revolution worldwide, that the civil war of workers against the<br>imperialists and explorers in all advanced countries begins to merge with war <br> national against international imperialism. This confirms the march of the revolution, and each time <br> more will be confirmed. ” (Lenin) 239 <br> And we conclude this point with the following words of Lenin, who fully deny the broken <br> UOC Small Burger (MLM) that aims to deny the validity and importance of the national liberation struggle, part <br> inseparable from the New Democracy Revolution, and its importance for the world proletarian revolution. <br> Thus demonstrate not to understand the problems of the proletarian revolution in the oppressed countries, which are the <br> vast majority in the world, therefore greater weight in the world proletarian revolution, as they do not understand <br> that the contradiction between nation/oppressed peoples is, in general, the main contradiction of the <br> imperialism, even the interimperialist contradiction may precipitate in World War, which <br> will inevitably transform into national liberation wars, as well as a revolutionary civil war <br> between proletariat and bourgeoisie in imperialist countries. <br> Says Lenin: <br> “And it is clear, therefore, that in the future decisive battles of the World Revolution the movement of <br> majority of the population of the Terraqueo globe, directed to the principle of national liberation, will turn <br> against capitalism and imperialism, and will perhaps play a very revolutionary role <br> more important than we expect. It is important to highlight that, for the first time in our international, <br> We have undertook the preparation of this fight. ” (Lenin) 240 <br><br><br> The recent tactical counterofnsive of the Palestinian National Resistance Heroic resistance confirms these <br> Revolutionary words of Lenin. LCI honor and continues this great Leninist precept. <br> 5- The development of capitalism in the countryside and the peasant problem in countries <br> semicolonials <br> Previously, when dealing with the revolution of new democracy, we abstract, to some extent, the analysis of the <br> agrarian and peasant problem in semicolonial countries. We did this to emphasize that the liberation task <br> national is a democratic task, possible to be resolved only by this type of revolution because <br> based on a front of revolutionary classes united with the proletariat and under its direction, through the party <br> Communist. This form of approach to the problem is more convenient, because national oppression is very <br> more visible than semi -feudality, as it follows existing underlying, most of the time <br> camouflaged by the evolution of their forms. In this topic and later, we will seek to analyze from the <br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism The general characteristics of the penetration of capitalism in the field, its <br> development and the actuality of the peasant problem in the semicolonal countries in the imperialist stage of the <br> capitalism. <br> UOC (MLM), by interpreting the agrarian and peasant problem in Colombia and other countries adopts the same <br> procedure of certain Brazilian hoxhists: 1st) take the theoretical foundation of their analysis, unique and <br> exclusively, the Leninist work The development of capitalism in Russia, as if this were the last <br> Lenin's word on the question; 2) transplant mechanically to Latin America the same <br> Lenin analysis categories without taking into account the fields of the field in Russia; 3) consider <br> that the development of capitalism in Russian agriculture, in the period analyzed by Lenin, that is, 1861 <br> 1897, period still in force of the first phase of capital, free competition, as if followed without <br> Any alteration is already in its monopolistic phase, imperialism. Thus conclude that as in <br> Russia, from the nineteenth century, capitalism advanced in the Latin American field in the twentieth century, <br> identical or very similar. Just as Brazilian Hoxhists, UOC (MLM) concludes about the <br> no peasant problem, because in the field of Latin American countries would be completed to <br> Peasant differentiation and, therefore, there would only be two classes there: the agrarian bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat. <br> The small property would remain as a museum piece, which must be respected, but in practice <br> Play no role in the revolutionary process. The agrarian program, therefore, must be a program <br> socialist; And here they repeat the same confusion as Brazilian revisionists: they take nationalization for <br> collectivization of the land, because they fail that in the grso, Lenin in proposing the nationalization of the land, in <br> October 1917, would have applied a socialist program for the Russian peasantry. Let's see more <br> in detail the harmful consequences of this falsification of theory and reality. <br> As seen in a previous topic, UOC (MLM) thinks there are a supposed progressive tendency of the <br> imperialism, which, in turn, would imply that the capital exported to the semicolonies would have the <br> to sweep the pre-capitalist production modes, particularly in the field. In this way they claim that:<br>“Exported capital acts on the germ or capitalist developments of the oppressed countries, and <br> as a trend generates, accelerates its development, sweeps the traces of pre-production modes <br> Capitalists, accelerates the decomposition of the peasantry. ” [UOC (MLM)] 241 <br> Thus conclude that the process analyzed by Lenin in nineteenth -century Russia completed itself <br> way in the twentieth century Colombia: <br> “In Colombia, it is a fact the decomposition and differentiation of the peasantry between agricultural proletarians and <br> bosses. This is the most notable phenomenon of the economic and social development of agriculture <br> During the last half century. The essence of the process is the differentiation of the peasantry in classes, <br> and not the 'evolution of semi -feudalism'. This process was done in an accelerated way, <br> mainly through the violent expropriation of independent producers and the concentration <br> of land and capital. ” [UOC (MLM)] 242 <br> That is, according to UOC (MLM), the export of capital by imperialism accelerated the process of <br> Differentiation of the peasantry, dividing this into agrarian bourgeoisie and rural proletariat; as a result <br> From this division the process of violent expropriation of poor peasants is accelerated. Conclude, therefore, <br> that the agrarian bourgeoisie formed by the decomposition of the peasantry expropriated the small owners, <br><br><br> thus culminating capitalist development in the Colombian field. Expropriation would serve, for a <br> side, to strengthen this newly created agrarian bourgeoisie, concentrating in its hands the earth, and for another <br> would create the agricultural proletariat without any production instrument and forced to sell its force of <br> work. <br> UOC theory (MLM) about the possibility of the emergence of an agrarian bourgeoisie, from <br> peasant differentiation in the semicolonial countries in the imperialist time, it only serves to adore the <br> Peasant expropriation, to paint with progressive colors this evolution of semi -feudality forms. <br> UOC (MLM), in the study of the Colombian process, arbitrarily interconnects the differentiation of peasants, <br> the emergence of new bosses and the violent expropriation of small owners. Highlights, that <br> particularity of the Colombian case would be the extreme violence of these expropriations and provides us with data <br> Impressive 165,000 deaths in the 1946-1957. The question that UOC (mlm) escapeotia is the <br> Analysis of which class did these expropriations. Which class is responsible for this killing in the fields <br> Colombians? Would be the agrarian bourgeoisie, emerged from the peasant differentiation, the person responsible for this <br> process? <br> UOC (mlm) sly omits this question, because in formulating it would have to indicate that the class <br> Responsible for these expropriations was the old Criollo Latifundium. It would have to conclude that these expropriations <br> do not represent the emergence of a new class in the field from peasant differentiation, but the <br> Strengthening of the old rural oligarchies so well known and archaic in Latin America. What a <br> UOC (mlm) is to mix two distinct analyzes made by Lenin in 1899, and put them as a cause of <br> violent peasant expropriations in Latin America. <br> In his masterful work, the development of capitalism in Russia, the great Lenin, in studying the evolution <br> capitalist in the Russian field, analyzes, one by one, two processes that are conjugated in objective reality: the <br> peasant economy and the landlord economy. In the chapter on the capitalist development of the farm <br> peasant Lenin studies in detail the process of peasant differentiation, showing how <br> development of the mercantile economy invariably led to the process of dividing the peasantry <br> In two opposite classes: the agrarian bourgeoisie and the rural proletariat. This study was particularly <br> important in Russia, therefore, the populist currents argued that the Russian peasant community <br> It represented the most solid base for the construction of socialism. Populists considered, therefore, <br> As a reactionary, the advancement of the mercantile economy and peasant differentiation. Lenin, in turn, will <br> show the progressive character of this process, because the peasant community, as well as the landlord, <br> They were inseparable parts of the Russian feudal economy. In this chapter, therefore, Lenin analyzes the emergence of <br> rural bourgeoisie, from the peasantry, "abstracting" the landowners, that is, not taking them into account, <br> initially, to more clearly demonstrate the capitalist evolutionary process of the peasant economy <br> Russian. Lenin shows, then, that the rich peasants to lease the land of the poor peasants <br> they ended up focusing on their hands these properties. The process led to a slow expropriation, <br> distinct from land expropriation. Therefore, Lenin highlights, at the end of the chapter, that this was not<br>Created bourgeoisie the true ruling class of the peasant village, but the old class <br> landlord: <br> “By saying before the Campesine bourgeoisie is the lord of the village of our day, we made abstraction <br> Of these factors that brake the differentiation: vassalage, usury, payment at work, etc. At <br> reality, the true masters of the contemporary village are not, in general, the representatives <br> of the peasant bourgeoisie, if not the rural usurers and the neighboring landowners. That <br> abstraction is, however, a method of all legitimate, because otherwise it is not possible to study the <br> internal regime of economic relations between the peasants. ” (Lenin) 243 <br> The UOC (mlm) abstract absolutely who the true masters of the field in Colombia, and present <br> peasant differentiation and mass expropriation as chains of a continuous process of evolution <br> full of capitalism in the field of semicolonial countries. <br> The process of developing capitalism in Russia, in relation to Latin America, has significant <br> time differences (s. XIX and s. XX) and space. The process studied by Lenin has the initial landmark <br> year 1861, when the so -called “emancipation” of servants in Russia, promulgated by the Czar, occurs <br> Alexander II. The so -called end of servitude was a direct consequence of the growth of the peasant struggle <br> Against the landlord, but the "solution" was a maneuver of the tsarist government against the peasants. Since the <br><br><br> ancient times, the peasants in the Russian Empire were organized in these communities, which they had <br> some important particularities: 1) Community lands were shared equally between <br> Its members, and from time to time there was a rotation of possession between them; 2) Taxes and Charges <br> feudal were paid “collectively” by all peasants, if one stopped paying, the value would have to be <br> Arcado by the others; 3) Peasants were prohibited from selling their land portions and leaving the <br> community. Until 1861, each of these communities was dominated by a particular landowner <br> neighboring, or directly by the imperial family. With the decree of “emancipation” the communities <br> they made formally separated from the neighboring estates to which they were linked by relationship of servitude. <br> However, the bonds between the peasant farm and the estates remained in two ways: the rescue <br> and the clippings. The rescue was the value that the peasant had to pay for his "emancipation", that is, the value <br> who should pay for the land portion he possessed. The clippings were large areas of communities <br> peasants expropriated by the landowners at the time of emancipation. These areas were generally <br> richer in natural and most fertile resources. Clippings and rescue prevented free development <br> of the peasant communities, because the peasants to produce needed to lease part of the lands <br> Cut, the woods as a source of wood, for example; besides having to spend an important part of <br> your budget with the payment of redemptions. <br> In The Development of Capitalism in Russia, Lenin centrally analyzes this process within the <br> peasant community, whose most significant result is the aforementioned peasant differentiation, in which <br> Wealthy peasants leased the installments of the poorest peasants, the same community. It is <br> differentiation led to a polarization within the community itself between rich peasants and <br> Poor peasants, a differentiation that tended to decomposition of peasantry in the peasant bourgeoisie <br> and rural proletariat. In the analysis of capitalist development in the landlord economy, in turn, <br> Lenin focuses on studying the transformation of the payment system into work (typically feudal) to the <br> salary system (typically capitalist). <br> As Lenin has in view of this process of capitalist development, he does not analyze, in this work, the <br> Anterior contradiction, older, typically feudal or semi -feudal, between landowners and peasants. No <br> analyzes for example the impact of rescues and clippings on peasants, as it concludes that the process <br> of the proletarianization of the poor peasantry was already consolidated. The agrarian program, for example, proposed <br> by Lenin, in 1903, at the II POSDR Congress defended the expropriation only of the clipped lands and their <br> Return to the peasants, not all lands of the landlord. There was no, at that moment the <br> understanding of the need for a peasant agrarian revolution as an indispensable part of the revolution <br> democratic-bourgeois, since economic data already indicated a consolidation of capitalism in the field <br> Russian. <br> However, the social process is always more sweeping than statistics. When the process is crack <br> Revolutionary, in January 1905, in March the peasants enter the Arena of the class struggle with<br>A force that surprised everyone. The struggle of this mass was not the struggle of the rural proletariat against the boss <br> peasant or better salaries against the contractist landowner. The claim of these masses was a <br> Only: Earth. Not just the clipped lands, expropriated by the aristocracy in 1861, but all the lands of the <br> Russia for the peasants. Arises from the struggle of these masses the claim of the nationalization of all <br> lands and the right to their private enjoyment for all who work in it. <br> Lenin is the first to grasp the meaning for the Russian revolution of that peasant insurrection, which <br> It would extend until December 1907. At the III Party Congress, in April 1905, Lenin advances the position <br> Bolshevik, which until then was the struggle for the hegemony of the proletariat in the bourgeois revolution, for the <br> understanding that this hegemony could only be reached if supported by the peasants. The tactic <br> fundamental of the Bolsheviks becomes that of the “revolutionary democratic dictatorship of workers and <br> peasants ”, as the only way to bring more radically to the end the bourgeois democratic revolution and <br> ensure its passage uninterrupted to the socialist revolution. <br> In accordance with this tactic, the Bolsheviks would have to direct their attention not only to the <br> contradiction between the agricultural proletariat and the peasant bourgeoisie or the capitalist landlord; Lenin highlights, <br> from 1905, which: <br><br><br> “Currently, as in the future, until it reaches the total victory of the peasant insurrection, the consign <br> revolutionary must necessarily take into account the antagonism between the peasants and the <br> landowners ”. (Lenin) 244 <br> The 1905 Revolution, with all its teachings, implied modifying important aspects of tactics and <br> Bolsheviks agrarian and peasant program. After all, a true revolutionary program is formulated <br> from the concrete struggle of the masses and not the simple cotection of statistical data. These modifications <br> did not disregard the importance of Lenin's genius work, the development of capitalism in Russia, as it <br> was fundamentally correct and rightly analyzed all Russian development trends, <br> thus setting the red Bolshevik fraction of social democracy with a powerful class analysis. <br> But the revolutionary struggle of the masses showed that the evolution of those trends would not be so fast <br> as then supposed Lenin in 1899. After all, the class struggle is the main data for the interpretation of <br> social reality: <br> “It is true that also at this point it must be borne in mind that the lack of an open movement of <br> Masses did not allow to solve the problem about the exact database (…). No one could <br> say safely, in advance, until what degree the peasants had been differentiated under the <br> Influence of partial transit of payment landowners at work to salaried payment. <br> No one could calculate the magnitude of agricultural workers constituted after the reform of <br> 1861 and to what extent had its interests of the interests of the peasant mass had been different <br> ruined. ” (Lenin) 245 <br> Life taught the Bolsheviks that this differentiation had not been so deep; that the contradiction <br> main in the Russian field was between peasants and landowners, and not between agrarian bourgeoisie and <br> Agricultural proletariat. Lenin was fully aware of this insufficiency and, applying the mass line to <br> process of development of revolutionary ideology, the guide thinking of the Russian revolution, showed <br> that the basis of the errors of the agrarian program of 1903, which defended the agrarian revolution only in the land <br> expropriated by the landowners and not in all land of the estates, it was in a “over -esteem <br> the degree of capitalist development in Russian agriculture ”. Thus, Lenin analyzes: <br> “(…) Error of our 'DOS CREAVAS' program, approved in 1903. The origin of this last error was rooted <br> in the fact that, by rightly defining the direction of development, we do not agree to define the <br> Moment of development. We supposed that the elements of the <br> capitalist agriculture, which had also crystallized at the Latifundian farm (exception made <br> to the "cutouts"; Hence the claim that the cuts were returned), which had been <br> also crystallized on the farm of the peasants, in which we seemed to have a strong <br> Peasant bourgeoisie, which is why this farm was not fit for the 'peasant agrarian revolution'. <br> What gave rise to this wrong program was not the 'fear' to the peasant agrarian revolution, but <br> yes the overdue of the degree of capitalist development in Russian agriculture. The traces of <br> servitude regime seemed to us then a small detail, and the capitalist farm on Earth <br> parcel [of the peasants] and that of landlords seemed to us a fully mature phenomenon and <br> consolidated." (Lenin) 246<br>Lenin thus describes the process of perception of line insufficiency and the need for his <br> development: <br> “The revolution put on this error. Confirmed the direction of the development defined by us. A <br> Marxist analysis of the classes of Russian society had been confirmed in such a brilliant way <br> the entire march of events, in general, and for the first two Dumas, in particular, that the <br> Non -Marxist socialism had been definitely disallowed. But the traces of the regime of <br> Servitude in the field resulted in being much stronger than we thought; Originated one <br> national movement of peasants and made this movement the touch stone of the whole <br> Bourgeois revolution. The role of hegemonic force, which revolutionary social democracy had <br> always marked to the proletariat in the bourgeois liberation movement, it had to be determined with <br> Greater accuracy, like the role of boss who takes the peasants behind him. What does it take? <br> For the bourgeois revolution in the most consequent and resolute sense. The correction of the error consisted of <br> that, instead of the private task of the struggle against the remains of the old in the agrarian regime, we had <br> to defend the tasks of the fight against the whole old agrarian regime. Instead of detangling <br> Latifaceous economy, we proposed its destruction. ” (Lenin) 247 <br><br><br> UOC (MLM), firstly, summarizes in one distinct phenomena (peasant differentiation and <br> violent expropriation) and thinks do a concrete analysis of peasant expropriation in the 1950s as <br> a process of capitalist development in the countryside and not of strengthening and capitalization of the archaic <br> Latifundium. There is nothing dialectic in this analysis; Its synthesis is once again the integration of two into one. <br> Secondly, they completely disregarded Lenin's analyzes, after the 1905 revolution, <br> rectifications made regarding the speed of this development, as well as the development of the tactic of <br> Fight not only against the remains of the old agrarian regime, but for the destruction of the landlord system. <br> Thus hope the Leninist theory to allegedly anchor its erroneous analysis of the possibility of a <br> capitalist development in agriculture in semicolonial countries at the time of imperialism that "sweeps" <br> semi -feudal relations. <br> And this distortion becomes even more absurd when they analyze the production relations present in the <br> Colombia between the “rural proletariat” and the “capitalist landowns”. UOC (MLM) states that the relations of <br> partnership in the Colombian field are not semi -feudal relations, but covert forms of relationships <br> salaried, purely capitalist. Once again applies Lenin's teachings in The <br> development of capitalism in Russia, once again disregards the later development of <br> Leninist analyzes on the issue and, as opposed to them, thus formulates the question: <br> “The process of the rise of the agricultural proletariat is in reality the process of disaggregation of <br> peasants especially of small owners, who subsist in the field, not in the quality of <br> servants, if not semi -proletarians, playing a special role in the network of capitalist relations <br> production in the field, when retained on Earth through a small portion, to ensure <br> Cheap labor in modern plantation or livestock. (…) The partnership that was classically the <br> transition system between feudal relations and capitalists, that is, the typical representative of the <br> semi -feudalism, in Colombia evolved its real content and became one of the modalities of <br> retention of workers on land to obtain salaried, cheap and <br> close to capitalist farms, that is, it became a capitalist exploration mode <br> from the earth. This salaried production relationship remains disguised with the old cloak of <br> partnership, in semi -feudal appearance, but in essence, capitalist. ” [UOC (MLM)] 248 <br> Lenin in The Development of Capitalism in Russia, analyzes exactly this same kind of relationship, the <br> partnership, in which the landowner gives a piece of land to the peasant to fix work force in the <br> field, to have it available at times when agricultural work requires more <br> workers, as in planting or harvesting. Lenin characterizes this form of exploration as a mixed <br> Between the payment system at work (feudal) and the capitalist (wage) system; that is, precisely <br> a semi -feudal form. UOC's direction (MLM) say that in Colombia this form has become a <br> Complete form of “Earth's capitalist exploitation mode”. But how this <br> conversion if one of the conditions of the capitalist production relationship is that the worker is free <br> (dispossessed) of production instruments? The economic explanation they give to this conversion, that is, from <br> partnership as a typical semi -feudal relationship in typical capitalist relationship, is as follows:<br>“Today in the form of the partnership, the content of a typically capitalist relationship of <br> Production: the capitalist (…) reverses its capital in agro: a part as constant capital <br> (instruments, facilities, seeds, fertilizers and other inputs) and another as variable capital (the <br> equivalent to the minimum wage that is obliged to 'advance' to the partner, formally on behalf of the <br> participation of this in 'profits'). And so much variable capital, that is, capital inverted to buy the force <br> work for production, which at the time of the supposed 'sharing', such 'advances' <br> discount on the part of the partner, when it exists; And if it does not exist, the partner is not required to <br> No return of such 'advances'. In reality this is a salaried production relationship <br> Disguised with the old cloak of the partnership. It matters little to the fact that in some cases the partner <br> have as supposed advantage the right to cultivate a small portion on your own. Already <br> we know the role that throws this access from the owner to Earth, in the whole of the capitalist relations of <br> Production in the field: retain cheap labor for commercial and livestock crop plantations. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 249 <br> Firstly, to fix a worker on the earth, either by any means, forced or by the “free” delivery of <br> A portion is a feudal element. This form of fixation, of “partnership” is also very common in the <br> Brazil, and this often hides a relationship of exploration as if it were a free association between <br> owners. In the example provided by UOC (MLM), it is a form of partnership in which the <br><br><br> worker would not enter with any production instrument, only “gain” a piece of land to <br> own cultivation. They say, then, that the participation of the partner's profit is not actually profit, but only <br> wage; as proof, they present the fact that if the business gives loss and there is no profit to share, the <br> Partner keeps his part and does not have to return it. This fact only proves that participation in profit is <br> a scam, however, does not prove the conclusion of the UOC (MLM) that this type of partnership would be a <br> Capitalist production relationship. However, this is an impossible proof, because the fixation of the force of <br> work is this compulsory or “free” (upon assignment of a portion of land) cannot be interpreted <br> as a relationship of wisdom free, typically capitalist. <br> When UOC (MLM) states that “it matters little to the fact that some partners” can cultivate a <br> Small portion, they are simply bypassing the essential particularity of this relationship. Because it is precisely <br> this “right” of cultivating a “giving” portion to the worker that allows, for various reasons, the <br> overexploitation of the working masses. The direction of UOC (MLM) are aware of this overexploitation, <br> even highlight the social importance for the entire Colombian exploration regime, however, <br> explain what economic conditions ensure this overexploitation: <br> “[Partner workers] play a special role in the network of capitalist production relations <br> in the field: on the one hand are retained on earth, through a portion, to be cheap labor from <br> modern plantation or livestock (…). On the other hand are the main source of the overpopulation <br> latent relative, which in Colombia is one of the most important sources of the <br> wages, not only in the field but also in the city and end of the general overexploitation of the <br> proletariat." [UOC (MLM)] 250 <br> UOC (MLM) points to an objective problem that is the relationship between the oppression of the peasantry <br> large estates and overexploitation of the workforce by the bourgeoisie in the process of extraction of added value in <br> semicolonial countries. However, once again they circumvent the problem without achieving its essence. You <br> They point out that the fixation of the workforce in the field, through the delivery of land portions, acts as <br> Source of general overexploitation in Colombian society, as it creates a latent relative overpopulation. Or <br> that is, they highlight only one aspect of the issue that is the increase in competition among the workers of the <br> Field, a competition that allows relegation, to a certain limit, from the price of the workforce. <br> But this competition exists so much in the countryside and even more intensely in the city; It can't be this, <br> Therefore, the explanation of the particularity of the phenomenon. The precise explanation of the overexploitation process <br> of the peasants in the partnership relationship was made by Lenin, and so we say that the direction of UOC (MLM) <br> EXAMINAL APPLIES THE TEACHINGS EXPOSED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPITALISM IN RUSSUE: <br> “Thus, in the payment system at work (…) the price of work, ordinarily, results <br> be less than half than the capitalist contract. As can only be in charge of paying in <br> I work the peasant of the locality and, in addition to Nadiel's provisional [Communal Land Lot], this fact<br>of the huge drop of payment clearly indicates the importance of Nadiel as a salary <br> Natural." (Lenin) 251 <br> Lenin is dealing with an example very similar to that presented by UOC (MLM). A landowner hires a <br> Peasant with a portion (Nadiel) neighboring his property; He spends this worker half of what <br> It would spend if it used the capitalist system, that is, if it hired a seasonal worker from another region. Lenin <br> Then it lists two reasons that enable this demotion of the price of the workforce. The first is the <br> competition between the peasants around the latifundium, because as they have the portion of land, in general, <br> can only sell their workforce to that landowner closely and in the same situation are <br> the other surrounding peasants. This forces the price of the workforce down because it represents, <br> As the UOC itself (MLM) indicates, the latent overpopulation source. The second reason points to the <br> Importance of the peasant portion as a natural salary of the peasant. That is, how the peasant has <br> a portion, even if its economy is ruined, what it provides for it serves to some extent <br> cover part of the annual reproduction costs of your workforce. As part of your necessary work is <br> covered by his work in “his” portion, which Lenin calls “natural salary”, enables the <br> employer landowner pay half the salary that would pay to a seasonal worker coming from another <br> region that had no portion of land. Lenin explains the issue even more clearly in another work: <br><br><br> “As a peasant can for several years do 6 rubles a work that is worth 10 rubles and <br> 69 Kopeks? Can do so because your portion covers part of the peasant family spending and <br> allows you to reduce the salary below the 'free hiring'. ” (Lenin) 252 <br> This is the secret that allows the relegation of the partner peasant salary, which in turn, as <br> highlights the direction of UOC (MLM), enables pressure down the wages of the workers in the set <br> of the economy, thus ensuring the overexploitation of work, which as Marx is the purchase of the <br> work for a price below its value. The question, therefore, that is in the analysis of this form of partnership is <br> Identify what kind of production relationship it configures, whether purely capitalist, or semi -feudal. <br> We can discard, however, the relegated assessment made by UOC (MLM) when considering that little <br> It is important if the partners can cultivate a portion on your own. No, in this case this is what the most <br> it matters. <br> In the complete economic analysis of this type of partnership, we see, as in every capitalist wage ratio, <br> that the “partner” in part of the journey works to reproduce his workforce, or as Marx <br> characterizes, constitutes the necessary work; and what part of the journey is the surplus work. <br> Suppose the peasant salary with a portion is 6 rubles, while the “free” wage earner is <br> 10 rubles, for the same job and the same journey, it is easy to deduce that surplus added value <br> Extracted from the peasant is 4 more rubles, than that of the “free” wage earner. If the value produced on the journey is <br> From 20 rubles, the surplus value produced by the Warm Camanery will be 14 rubles, and that of the wage earner “free” <br> 10 rubles. Already the rate of added value, according to one of the formulas presented by Marx will be: <br> surplus rate = added value <br> wage <br> For the wage earner “free” = 10/10 = 1 = 100%; while the value rate obtained by exploiting the <br> “Partner” will be = 14/6 = 2.3 = 230%. It is precisely the cultivation in the “ceded” portion by the landowner to <br> Partner that ensures this difference in the rate of added value. And UOC (MLM) states that “unimportant <br> Partners cultivate in a portion. ” <br> As Lenin indicates the secret of this overexploitation is that the peasant work in his portion constitutes the <br> its natural salary, covers part of the peasant family spending, so it can reproduce its strength of <br> work receiving from the landlord a salary 4 lower rubles. However, the landowner is the owner of the <br> installment provided “free of charge” to the unhealthy peasant. The production of the peasant in this portion is not <br> independent, because there is a relationship of exploration between the landlord that gives it, and the peasant that <br> Cultivate. The assignment as we have seen is not free, because the work of the peasant in it, provides the landlord a <br> Extra 4 rubles of 4 rubles. The peasant's work in the portion, therefore, also divides into work <br> necessary and surplus work, what it produces in it that serves to supply the 4 rubles that the landowner <br> Take out of your salary is an surplus work that the landowner appropriates indirectly. The earth therefore not <br> is provided for free to the peasant, the amount of covert income he pays to the landlord is exactly the <br> value that it discounts you from the salary.<br>It is this production relationship that is covered in the partnership, which aims to fix the workforce in the field. <br> It appears as a free assignment of the land, as a favor that the landlord grants to the peasant. This one feels <br> Thanks to repay this OBSEQUIO, with more extra work, for example: repair fences and others <br> care on the property, or the work of your wife in the household treats, in addition, it is obvious to the vote <br> of your family on the list of candidates appointed by the kind landowner. This is the dependency bond <br> guys, that alone explains why the peasant agrees to be “retained” on Earth, agrees to earn a salary below <br> Market, even because there is no choice in this situation in which it is. This is a wage ratio and <br> servile, that is, typically semi -feudal, by no means typically capitalist. This is an example that illustrates <br> very well as under the forms of salary, give pre-capitalist relationships that <br> They reproduce maintained by imperialism because they are the ones that are most used to obtain the maximum profit. <br> This is the historical and present reality of the oppressed countries, in which the reactionary imperialist bourgeoisie, <br> through the export of capital, in them engendered bureaucratic capitalism on the precapitalist base, <br> feudal/semi -feudal and maintain and reproduces underlying their relationships of property and exploitation of work <br> through the evolution of their forms. That is, contrary to the understanding of the direction of the UOC (MLM) that <br><br><br> Such a partnership is “in semi -feudal appearance, but in essence, capitalist” it is in capitalist appearance and in <br> semi -feudal essence. <br> However, once again the direction of UOC (MLM), besides applying badly Lenin's teachings in The <br> development of capitalism in Russia, do not take it in the whole of his work, how he developed, <br> Subsequently, your analysis of the meaning of this type of partnership relationship. So cite the following <br> Lenin's passage to characterize this exploration relationship as typically capitalist: <br> “The assignment of land to the field worker is often made in the interest of the owners themselves <br> Rural and, therefore, the type of rural worker with a portion is proper to all capitalist countries. <br> In the different states acquires different forms: English cottage is not the same as the peasant with <br> portion of France or the provinces of Renaas, and the latter either is the same as the wage earner or <br> Prussia knecht. Each boasts the footprints of a peculiar agrarian regime, of a history <br> peculiar to agrarian relations, but this is not an obstacle for the economist to include them in a <br> same type of agricultural proletariat. ” (Lenin) 253 <br> UOC (MLM) takes this passage as support to classify this form of partnership as <br> typically capitalist. First, the fact that it is a relationship present in all capitalist countries <br> It does not mean that it is a typically capitalist relationship. Secondly, as we saw in the texts of <br> Lenin after 1905, he acknowledges that at times he excelled the degree of development of the <br> Capitalism in Russian agriculture, which was difficult: “Calculate the magnitude of agricultural workers <br> constituted after the 1861 reform and to what extent had its interests from the interests <br> of the ruined peasant mass ”. Lenin himself would later classify this type more accurately <br> exploration relationship: <br> “(…) In all capitalist countries even in the most advanced, remains of exploitation <br> medieval, semi -feudal, of the small peasants near the large owners <br> agrarian such as instleute in Germany, the metayers in France and the partners <br> tenants in the EE.UU. (not only blacks, which are explored in most cases in the states of the <br> South precisely this way, but sometimes also white). ” (Lenin) 254 <br> Or as Lenin analyzes the typical partnership relationship in the south of the US, as a transition from work <br> slave to salary, a particularly important phenomenon for the study of economic <br> social from Brazil and Colombia, for the sharp weight of the slave exploitation of blacks also in these two <br> countries: <br> “In North America, the typical white farmer owns its land and the typical black Farmer is <br> tenant. (…) In no way are they concerned in the European, civilized, capitalist sense <br> modern of the word. Semi -feudal partners prevail or, which from the economic point of view is <br> the same, semi -scraves. ” (Lenin) 255 <br> And classifies this type of partnership as a base: <br> “(…) Typically Russian, 'genuinely Russian', that of the payment system at work, ie the <br> partnership." (Lenin) 256 <br> This type of partnership, even in its most evolved form, intended only to fix workforce in the <br> Field, cannot be considered as typically capitalist. Its particularity, the one that allows the<br>relegation of the price of the workforce below its value of this Waiver's peasant, is precisely <br> The indirect exploitation of the landowner over the peasant work in his installment. UOC (mlm) points to <br> importance of this type of relationship in the economies of semicolonies as one of the main sources of <br> overexploitation of the proletariat and masses of oppressed countries. However, they interpret incorrectly <br> The economic and social content of this production relationship classifies it as typically capitalist <br> when it is typically semi -feudal. This is a theoretical issue of paramount importance resolved by Lenin and <br> Previously pointed out by the great Engels: “Only semi -service, sanctioned by law and inertia <br> of customs opens unlimited possibilities for the exploration of agricultural wage earners. ”257 <br> If the direction of UOC (MLM) is consequent in its analysis of Colombia, recognize the colossal error <br> to classify the partnership as a typically capitalist relationship, it will be required to conclude that the <br><br><br> overexploitation of the Colombian proletariat, by sitting in the partnership relations, rests on relations <br> semi -feudal production and non -capitalist. This conclusion has great meaning for the process <br> Colombian revolutionary, as understands the CCP (red fraction) and proletarian-MLM power, <br> which will provide new impulses to the march of the proletariat of this country towards the reconstitution of its party of <br> Vanguard and the Colombian Revolution. <br> We evaluated that from a practical point of view, from the class struggle in recent years in Colombia, there are many <br> Elements that justify this rectification. Colombia and Mexico are, par excellence, the homeland of the guerrillas <br> peasants in Latin America. The uninterrupted decades of peasant guerrillas in Colombia express <br> the intake effort of the peasant masses that has not prospered precisely because they lack direction <br> proletarian at height. <br> From the theoretical point of view, we evaluate that the errors in the analysis of Latin-social and economic formations <br> Americanas leads UOC (MLM) to present an agrarian program unable to mobilize the peasant masses. <br> Even because it leads to considering that this is not a strategic task of the Colombian revolution, in the <br> as they conclude that the process of peasantry differentiation is completed, which means <br> that the fundamental classes of the Colombian field would be today the agricultural proletariat and the rural bourgeoisie. <br> That the old landlord, based on typically capitalist relations, has evolved to become great capital. <br> Therefore, there would be no economic basis to speak rigorously in the antagonism between peasants and <br> landowners, for they would have become proletarians and bourgeois; What would remain would be just a <br> Rest of small production, as it is also preserved in cities. <br> The peasant differentiation identified by Lenin in 1899 cannot develop in the same way <br> Already at the time of imperialism, in the colonial/semicolonial countries. In the differentiation that exists in <br> rural communities today in Brazil, the peasantry is divided into a rich or medium peasant <br> Poor peasantry workforce, especially the landless or with little land. However, the conditions <br> of transformation of this peasantry rich in an agrarian bourgeoisie have completely modified. We are <br> at the time of imperialism, monopolistic capital, then the peasant economy, even the wealthy <br> how to make progress a lot, as it competes with the great agricultural production of the old large estates coupled with the great <br> bourgeoisie and, most of the time, intertwined with financial capital. Even if a peasant <br> differentiate, explore the poor peasants of your village, at most it can be a privileged lacque <br> Local Latifundium; very hardly will become a bourgeois, just as small industry has only <br> how to subsist in urban centers as an auxiliary production unit of large production, in general in <br> permanent ruin. <br> Another particularity of Latin America, in relation to Russia studied by Lenin, is that its economy <br> Latifundia did not evolve into a mercantile form only in the nineteenth century, it was born in this condition, <br> focused on the foreign market, under the sign of the international division of labor. So the content <br> characteristic of the economic and social formations of some Latin American countries are marked by the <br> plantations system, large export monoculture productions, settled in slave labor and <br> servile. In Russia, at the end of the 1861 reform, the peasant communities were in possession of half of the <br> Farming Lands. The small peasants were semi-owners of parts of these lands, the Nadiels, and <br> leased them. The lease of land by poor peasants in Latin America is a well <br> rare. In Brazil, it will appear more often in the most recent history, in the “projects of<br>Settlement ”of the“ bureaucratic agrarian reform ”of the old state. In them the poorest peasants <br> They end up leasing their lands to the neighboring landowner or the wealthy peasant of the locality. Or when <br> several of these peasants from the same continuous lane of land together, together, <br> soybean and sugarcane cultivators, surrounded by these large estates, as well as <br> turn their land into pasture and lease them to the cattle rainfall, or with others to <br> Cattle breeding by sock. But this is a recent phenomenon, result and does not cause the development of <br> Capitalism in agriculture. What has always happened and continues to occur is the poor peasant without any <br> land or small owner lease from the neighboring farmer a portion, usually for a time of ten <br> years, to cultivate it at sock, Tuesday, and at the end of the contract, you have to deliver the installment and hundreds <br> of hectares of landing land with formed pastures. Also having, as part of the contract, having to <br> Maintain the fences of the entire landlord and other services. <br><br><br> The Spanish and Portuguese crowns transposed to America a deciduous system based on the monopoly <br> feudal of the earth, where in many cases a feudal regime and other slave-feudal, which in <br> Both cases, as a rule, completely excluded the peasant property of the earth. In Brazil, in general, the <br> Peasant has always been a resident of the landlords. Only became free if it fled to the regions <br> most remote beyond agricultural border. There established its place, its natural economy and its precarious freedom <br> compared to the previous servitude. So it was until the “owner” of the earth arrived, with a title of <br> “Legal” or counterfeit property provided by the Old State notary bureaucracy, supported by power <br> oligarchic that he enjoyed and expropriated the peasant lands. The Saga of the Possers in Brazil, <br> in a permanent struggle against land expropriation, is a medular and essential part of our history, of a <br> Continued peasant war and interspersed with moments of rise and descent. <br> The capitalism that has penetrated and developed in Latin American agriculture is particularly different from <br> Way that took place in Russia analyzed by Lenin. Here the rich peasants had no way <br> transform into an agrarian bourgeoisie; As a rule, it is the old large estate. The role of <br> Brazil in the world economy has boosted capitalist relations in the countryside, there is a sharp <br> capitalist development in agriculture. But this capitalism is not the same as analyzed by Lenin, in the <br> 19th century, at the time of free competition. It is a capitalism that is formed at the time of imperialism and in <br> an oppressed country; Russia was, in the words of Lenin, a "imperialist military-feudal" country. Here in Brazil, <br> what was developed was bureaucratic capitalism engendered by imperialism and totally in the service of <br> needs of imperialist powers; unlike Russia analyzed by Lenin, there was no <br> national industry of agricultural machinery that boosts national agricultural development <br> independent. Capitalist development has always been subdued to the interests of the metropolis. And for this <br> Imperialism never swept semi -feudal relations in the countryside; Therefore, these relationships continue to subsist <br> in a hidden way through the evolution of its forms. <br> In peasant semicolonial countries are the main and not agricultural proletariat, although peasants are <br> expelled from the countryside is the agricultural proletariat that moves in quantity with the advancement of mechanization - <br> at the robotics application stage and soon with the remote operation of the machines. Semi -feudal exploration is <br> basis of bureaucratic capitalism engendered by imperialism, as a need for subjugation <br> semicolonial of the country and for the overexploitation of its proletariat and other working masses. That's why <br> continues to reproduce and the peasant economy although ruined does not disappear, because it is necessary to <br> Type of capitalism possible to reproduce in countries dominated by imperialism. With this base <br> delayed and anachronistic economic, the corresponding superstructure continues to remain, in fundamental, <br> underlying semi -feudality in new forms apparently bourgeois and, secondarily, in the same <br> Old forms, as in legal the inequality of civil rights in the countryside. All an old man who only <br> can be swept if the landlord property is destroyed. This is a task of paramount importance for the <br> Proletarian revolution and the more radically it advances the more close to socialism. No <br> therefore, it constitutes no progress on peasant expropriation in the semicolonial countries, this is not <br> a sign of social development, but of delay, the emptying of the field, its depopulation, which<br>became the main counterrevolutionary policy of imperialism in the oppressed countries and mainly <br> from Yankee imperialism to Latin America, particularly after the triumph of Chinese revolutions, <br> Korean, Vietnamese and Cuban. Engels, in 1894, already highlighted this issue in his criticism of Kautsky, for <br> account of the agrarian program of the German Social Democratic Party: <br> “The greater the number of peasants to which we can save the effective fall in the proletariat, <br> and that we can win to us as peasants, - so much faster and so much easier <br> the transformation of society. We have no interest in waiting, so that this transformation <br> Perform that capitalist production develops everywhere and even its last consequences; It is <br> that the last small artisan and the last small peasant have fallen into the claws of the great <br> capitalist exploitation. ” (Engels) 258 <br> The masses that will sweep the landlords with greater radicality and the monopoly of land ownership, in <br> The source of its future nationalization will be the masses of peasants, especially the poor peasants. A <br> Flag that can gather these masses is confiscation and immediate delivery of the land to these peasants. It is <br> Fight can only be made widely linked to the struggle for the conquest of power, because if the peasant problem is the <br> Earth problem, the problem of the earth is the problem of political power, that of the overthrow of the power of the landlord <br> and the semicolonial imperialist domination that rests on it by boosting bureaucratic capitalism. <br><br><br> Therefore, the UOC agrarian program (MLM) is completely incorrect for semicolonial countries as <br> You can check: <br> “It is indispensable that the agricultural proletariat, which does not have the degree of concentration of the proletariat <br> industrial, be independent of peasantry, both by its program and its organization; only <br> Thus can subtract from the Rural Small Burger atmosphere of the owner and the illusion in the small <br> property. Only then can you teach the peasants that to save should be aligned with the <br> proletariat to fight private property and convert the property of its land into <br> collective property and exploitation, because the individual exploitation conditioned by the property <br> Individual, is the one that pushes the peasants to ruin. ” [UOC (MLM)] 259 <br> UOC's direction (MLM) insistently accuse us of "leftists", however, there can be no <br> more opportunistic agramponian program of “left” than hers; It is opportunist for “left” and <br> idealistic. Intend to mobilize the scarce agricultural proletariat to teach poor landless peasants and <br> with little land the importance of the fight against private property, to convince them to convert their <br> small properties in collective explorations is something more childish than the dreams of Russian populists, <br> which they intended to convert the peasant communities into Baluartes of Socialism. Is a demonstration of <br> total ignorance about the nature of the peasantry and its greatest review, the property of the earth, is <br> push them against the proletariat and to endure them to the field of counterrevolution. It is of a doctrineist idealism <br> sterile and simply foolish. More than that, a policy thus carried out between the peasantry is a <br> Crime against the strategy of hegemony of the proletariat in the single front and the conquest of its power. <br> What the peasant understands is that the absence of land, little quantity and poor quality is the cause <br> immediate of your ruin. This sensitive knowledge is revolutionary, as it directs the peasant fury against <br> The opposite class: the landlord that concentrates and monopolizes lands and natural resources. Yes, it is necessary in the <br> Fighting Course, convincing the peasantry that it is no use destroying only the neighboring landowner, but the whole <br> landing system and also confiscar the large private companies from the areas released to the new <br> Popular revolutionary state, until it establishes it throughout the country. In the course of this struggle, just like that, he <br> You can learn that private property is not a redemption, that if it interrupts your fight in the middle, it will <br> again to ruin; The earth will concentrate again. The same iron cycle will be repeated as the fight <br> Worker if she is restricted to the economic, union struggle. Under the conditions of imperialism only with power <br> in the hands of the single revolutionary front under the hegemony of the proletariat, through his communist party, the <br> Peasants will fully understand the limit of the small property. They can thus forge this <br> awareness in the course of revolutionary war, because there they learn the importance of the new relations of <br> production. And especially they learn that freedom is more important than land ownership. As <br> said Lenin, the peasant in the struggle for the land catches the rifle, with the rifle in hand discovers freedom, then <br> It becomes more important to it than the earth. Thus turning into peasants<br>revolutionaries firmly joined with the proletariat. And reinforces once again already exerting the dictatorship of the <br> proletariat about the illusion of convincing peasants with only proclamation and exhortations <br> Intended: <br> “The proletariat must now solve the second problem, show the peasantry that it can offer <br> the example and practice of economic relations that will result higher than those in which each <br> Peasant family adjusts to their space. So far, the peasants no longer believe that in this <br> old system and continue considering it normal. This is no doubt. It is an irremediable Sandex <br> suppose that our advertising can change the peasants on topics of <br> Vital reach, about the economy. Peasants are expecting; of a neutral-hostile attitude <br> before us have moved to a neutral-benévola attitude. Prefer us to any other government, because <br> see that the workers, proletarian, proletarian dictatorship is not brutal violence, usurpation, <br> as they presented it; but it is a better defender of the peasants than the sequences of Kolchak, <br> Deninkin, etc. ” (Lenin) 260 <br> In addition to the illusion of convincing by advertising, UOC (MLM) presents the proposition of collectivization as <br> Flag of the Order of the Day. This task was not even placed by the October socialist revolution, which <br> despite having established the dictatorship of the proletariat, by nationalizing land ownership <br> peasant production immediately. Lenin thus addresses the problem of land collectivization in the revolution <br> Russian: <br><br><br> “As for the way of exploiting the confiscated lands of the large landowners by the proletariat <br> victorious, in Russia has predominant, because of their economic delay, the sharing of these lands <br> and its delivery in enjoyment to the peasants; only in relatively rare cases, does the proletarian state <br> maintained the so -called 'Soviet farms'. ” (Lenin) 261 <br> The nationalization flag, raised by the peasants in 1905, adopted by the party since then, <br> not yet equals the collectivization of agriculture and even less its socialization, as <br> Revisionists, in addition to the Trotskyists. Lenin defines “the nationalization of the earth, which <br> less consequent complained all representatives of the peasantry between 1905 and 1907 ”as the form <br> more radical of van of servitude, as a democratic-bourgeois task, therefore: <br> “The abolition of private property on the earth does not or minimally the bourgeois base of <br> Commercial and capitalist rustic property. There is nothing more wrong than thinking that <br> nationalization of the earth has something common with socialism or even with the egalitarian enjoyment <br> of the same. Socialism, as we know, means the liquidation of the mercantile economy. A <br> nationalization means transforming land into the property of the state, and this transformation <br> It does not affect the private exploitation of the earth at all. (…) Nationalization completely sweeps the <br> medieval relations in the territorial property regime, destroys all artificial barriers in the <br> Earth and makes it effectively free. (…) Nationalization would accelerate the death of the regime of servitude and the <br> Development of purely bourgeois farms on land free of all medieval waste. This is <br> the true historical significance of nationalization in Russia as it appears in the end of the century <br> XIX. ” (Lenin) 262 <br> Nationalization did not emerge as a peasantry flag in Latin America, so our consign <br> be of “land for those who live in it and works”. The experience of the great socialist revolution of October and the <br> Great Chinese Revolution demonstrated that the agrarian revolution was, par excellence, the <br> ensure the nationalization of the land and, therefore, collectivization in agriculture, ensuring the hegemony of <br> proletariat in both cases: the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia and the joint class dictatorship <br> revolutionary and their uninterrupted passage to socialism. Lenin points out that, despite the inconveniences <br> economic that may arise from too much land sharing, the main aspect in the application of <br> AGRICARY PROGRAM AGREEMENT is the question of ensuring the triumph of the revolution and consolidating the new power: <br> “However, it would be a very serious mistake to exaggerate this rule [of collectivization] or convert it to standard <br> and do not admit in any case the free delivery of a part of the land of the expropriates <br> expropriated to small peasants and sometimes even to the average peasants of the neighboring boundaries. <br> Firstly, the usual objection against this is to claim that the great explorations <br> Agricultural are technically superior (…). To ensure the success of this revolution, the proletariat does not <br> It is entitled to dwell on the temporary decrease of production (…). For the bourgeois the production <br> It is an end in itself; but for workers and exploited it matters to them, above all, to defeat<br>explorers and ensure conditions that allow them to work for themselves and not for the <br> capitalist. The fundamental and primordial task of the proletariat is to ensure and ensure <br> your triumph. And there can be no guarantee of proletarian power without neutralizing the average peasants and <br> without ensuring the support of a very considerable part of the small peasants, but <br> totality. ” (Lenin) 263 <br> Imperialism and the development of capitalism in the countryside do not solve the agrarian-field problem <br> in the colonial and semicolonial countries. For this reason, semi -feudality on the basis of the fundamental social contradiction <br> In the field of these countries is the antagonism between the poor peasantry and the landlord. The agrarian program to be <br> established by the communists, it must start from the concrete experience of the direction of the struggle of these masses in defense <br> From their claims, especially from the land to those who live and work in it. Advance in this fight leads <br> invariably to the problem of revolutionary violence and the struggle for power. After all, as brilliantly <br> established President Gonzalo: <br> “(…) To talk about the peasant problem is to talk about the problem of the earth, to talk about the problem of the earth is <br> to talk about the military problem, and to talk about the military problem is to talk about the problem of power, the new <br> State to which we arrived with a democratic revolution directed by the proletariat through his party, <br> The Communist Party. ” (President Gonzalo) 264 <br> Dodge the direction of the peasant struggle by the earth is invariably dodging the military problem, <br> Question that immediately stands in the initial and most elementary forms of the Earth Fight. <br><br><br> III- The maximum profit law and the main contradiction in the imperialist time <br> In the previous section we made the criticism of the wrong political and social conceptions of the UOC Board (MLM) <br> about imperialism. We seek to demonstrate the full opposition between the theses of a supposed “trend <br> progressive imperialism that sweeps the modes of pre-capitalist production in the oppressed countries “and the <br> ideology of the international proletariat, particularly with the contributions and developments of Leninism and <br> of Maoism. After all, as the great Lenin established: “The political particularities of imperialism are the <br> reaction throughout the line and the intensification of national oppression ”265. <br> We saw how false are the consequences of this position of UOC (MLM), therefore, considers that the export of <br> Capital of imperialism to the oppressed countries was responsible for the drumming of feudality. What, <br> Therefore, the agrarian problem was solved in this way and that the social contradiction <br> fundamental in the field is not between peasants and landowners, but between rural proletariat and <br> agrarian bourgeoisie. This leads to the direction of UOC (MLM) to advocate a semi-annual agrarian program that <br> It defends the need to convince poor peasants to collectivize their property and production. <br> This issue is ABC for the Marxist-Leninist-Maoists of the oppressed countries. <br> In this section we will criticize the economic foundations of this erroneous conception of the direction of <br> UOC (mlm). We waged this struggle not in the unique objective and need to “demonstrate serious mistakes” <br> UOC formulations (MLM), but mainly because these are issues of paramount importance for the <br> MCI. In this sense the struggle of two lines against the erroneous positions of UOC (MLM) mainly serves <br> to raise the communists's understanding of the particularities of imperialism and to develop the <br> ideology of the international proletariat aiming to solve new problems posed by the course of <br> World proletarian revolution. Among these, we highlight theoretical problems as understanding the issue <br> of land income in the semicolonial countries in the imperialist stage and the current role of the peasantry in the <br> World proletarian revolution. Theoretical issue related to immediate practical problems, political- <br> military, how communists must face the policy of the imperialism of the emptying of the <br> Field, aiming to make it difficult to develop prolonged popular war. These are issues in which they reside <br> foul ideological problems, which greatly surpass the current controversy, but that the current struggle of two <br> Lines requires that they are emphasized and dwell on them. <br> 1- The maximum profit as a particularity of monopolistic capitalism <br> From the point of view of political economy, the direction of UOC (MLM) maintains, as seen earlier, that the <br> capitalism in the imperialist stage, in addition to being a monopolistic, would have “converted into a mode of production <br> internationalized ”266; that imperialism “chained all countries - with their specific modes of <br> Production - in one world economy ”267. We previously demonstrated that this chain <br> it already gave in the stage of free competition of capital, with the development of the contrary unit “great <br> Capitalist world industry and market ”. Conceive imperialism as a “mode of production<br>268, in the sense of understanding that at this stage of world capitalism, “imperialism broke the <br> national borders and has faced in the world Arena class against class ”269, constitutes a great deviation <br> of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. Understand, as UOC (MLM) does, that the contradiction versus <br> bourgeoisie, in the imperialist stage, becomes “a single contradiction that faces the entire proletariat of <br> world against the bourgeoisie of the world ”270, can sound to some as a“ left ”phrase but not <br> It goes from old apologetic trotskyist formulation of imperialism and pure rightism. <br> Lenin points out that imperialism is due to the concentration of production with which: “Competition <br> converts into a monopoly. This results in a gigantic progress of the socialization of production ”, however,“ <br> appropriation is still private ”271. This progress in the socialization of production, therefore, does not occur as <br> Defends mr. AVAKIAN through “the integration of colonies into a new global framework that allows the <br> imperialist capital expands and restructures internationally with more profits and transforming <br> production relations of the oppressed countries to adapt them to their requirements ”272. President Mao takes <br> position by the conclusion of the communist international that “imperialism, with all the financial power and <br> military personnel in China, is the force that supports, encouraged, cultivates and retains feudal survival, with <br><br><br> all its bureaucratic-military superstructure ”273. Say that imperialism is a “mode of production <br> that by integrating the colonies into a new global landmark transforms production relations ”, or that <br> “Scans the modes of pre-capitalist production”, it is just apology for imperialism, the mystification of <br> An alleged “progressive tendency” of this. <br> One of the particular traits of imperialism is that it progresses the socialization of production through <br> elevation of national oppression and not of its overcoming, through the conservation of feudal survival, and <br> Not transforming or sweeping them, as the Avakian revisionist and the direction of UOC (MLM) argues. For <br> Lenin, the progress of the socialization of production in imperialism implies that “monopolistic capitalism <br> exacerbated all the contradictions of capitalism. Just indicate the famine of life and the game of cartels. It is <br> exacerbation of contradictions is the most powerful driving force of the historical period of transition started with <br> the definitive victory of world financial capital ”274. As imperialism is the reaction throughout the line, this <br> exacerbates contradictions and does not solve them; enables, however, that the proletariat directs the resolution of <br> all these contradictions (even the pending of the bourgeois revolution) and, therefore, marks the beginning of the new <br> Era, the age of the world proletarian revolution. <br> Let's see now, how the direction of UOC (MLM) seeks to economically justify this conception of <br> imperialism and the particular type of capitalist development in oppressed countries. In its most <br> recent criticism of our party and LCI, states that: <br> “Imperialism made the growth of the reserve army even more drastic and knew how to take advantage <br> ‘The low prices and abundance of available salaried workers or vacant workers’ as well as the <br> relative delay of other productive forces in the oppressed countries, low prices that, as already <br> we said, means overexploitation of the proletariat in the oppressed countries and relative delay that <br> its turn reproduces itself by how compensated in the superlucros for imperialists and for <br> native ruling classes. ” [UOC (MLM)] 275 <br> States that imperialism takes advantage of the growth of the reserve army to overeat the <br> proletariat in the “oppressed countries”, thus ensuring superlucros for imperialists “and classes <br> native dominant ”. Says that the semicolonial bourgeoisies give superlucros such as imperialism, from <br> The same way that states that these bourgeoisie reach the same profit rate as financial capital. As <br> Lenin demonstrates in his studies on imperialism, the superlucrum becomes a particularity of capital <br> Financial, in the phase of monopolistic capitalism. <br> The imperialist profit as a monopolistic profit, as we will see in detail, is necessarily exclusive, for <br> he argues for the monopolistic corporations and the imperialist states that are dignified by the boot <br> countries oppressed to make them colonies and semicolonies, exactly to ensure the best condition in the <br> competition and thus be able to ensure captive markets for the goods of their corporations and, at the same <br> time, sources of raw material and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of the workers that the conditions <br> of delay that impose on these countries and the impediment of the independent development of the same <br> provides. The monopoly implies the exclusivity of certain conditions of production and circulation of<br>more favorable goods. The free competition, its opposite, is that corresponding theoretically by the <br> less, to equal competition conditions. This economic reasoning used by UOC (MLM), has already been <br> previously formulated by old revisionists, but before discussing the authorship of the empallic, let's see <br> firstly as it is in full opposition to Leninism, which thus analyzes the particularity of the <br> Imperialist monopoly, in relation to the monopoly of England of manufacturing industry in the nineteenth century: <br> “In the thirteenth century we watched the formation of monopolies of another genre [in relation to the <br> Monopoly of England in the nineteenth century]: first, monopolistic unions of capitalists in all <br> countries of developed capitalism; second, monopolistic situation of a few rich countries, <br> in which capital accumulation had achieved gigantic proportions. A huge <br> 'Capital surplus' in advanced countries. ” (Lenin) 276 <br> Lenin makes it clear that capital accumulation in gigantic proportions occurs in a few countries <br> rich, never in all countries. Because the reason for the formation of this “surplus of capital” is <br> precisely under the monopolistic conditions of which the oppressed countries are private. The condition of <br> Privileged monopolist is the economic basis of the interimperialist contradiction, the powers dispute with each other <br> The privileges that allow monopolistic profits, as exposed above. Assume that an oppressed country can <br><br><br> accumulate capitals with the same profit rate as the imperialist bourgeoisie is completely opposed to <br> Economic foundations of the Leninist Theory of Imperialism. Lenin treats the dispute this way <br> interimperialist by the monopolistic condition: <br> “Any country that has more colonies, capital and troops than 'ours', 'us' deprives certain <br> privileges, of certain profits or superluchrs. Just as among different capitalists <br> superluchrs go to those whose machines are higher than average (…), so also among the <br> Nations, the one that is economically in the best condition is the one that gets superluchrs. ” <br> (Lenin) 277 <br> That is, the superluchrs, the accumulation rate obtained by the imperialists, it is only possible to reach the deprive <br> the competing power of certain privileges. The more in relation to colonial and semicolonial countries, <br> Therefore, it is a complete nonsense to say that the ruling classes of these countries can earn super students <br> as well as imperialism. Monopoly is essentially exclusive, this is one of its particularities. <br> However, the monopoly of which production conditions ensure these super students? Lenin gives us this <br> response: <br> “The imperialism of the beginnings of the twentieth century ended the world's sharing among a handful of <br> States, each of which they currently explore (in the sense of obtaining superluch) a part <br> 'Worldwide' (…); each occupies a monopoly position in the world market <br> Thanks to the Trustes, the cartels, the financial capital, the creditor relations with the debtor; each one <br> of them to some extent a colonial monopoly (…). ” (Lenin) 278 <br> The question is extremely clear: a handful of states explores a part of the world to obtain <br> Superluklars; they earn these superlucros precisely because they occupy a monopolistic position in the market <br> worldwide, thanks to the high concentration of productive capital in the Trustes; They earn monopolistic profits <br> because they are colonial monopolists. Like the colonial or semicolonial bourgeoisie, it could reach the same <br> profit rate of the financial oligarchy, to the point of becoming a capital exporter? At this point <br> The economic formulations of the UOC Directorate (MLM) arrive, indicate that the bourgeoisie of the countries <br> semicolonial and colonial are becoming capital exporters: the bourgeoisie of the "countries <br> oppressed capitalists reached “a great accumulation of capital doing it excessive too”, not <br> if it can “evade its true monopolistic character and its imperialist aspirations” 279. <br> Consider this possibility is to make the apology of imperialism, is that the “imperialist integration” <br> allows all bourgeoisie to grow in the same proportion. As Marx analyzes in The Capital, when dealing with the <br> concentration and centralization of the capital, this harmonic growth was not possible even in the free stage <br> competition, because as it demonstrates the largest capitals always tend to expropriate the minors <br> Thus centralizing, increasingly, capital in the hands of a fewer bourgeois. The step <br> Imperialist results precisely from this very high concentration of capital. This makes it impossible, therefore, <br> that a bourgeoisie with less capital accumulate enough to become a competitor of the bourgeoisie <br> imperialist in the capital export market. Judge that bourgeoisie from different countries are associated<br>freely and share all the social value of social value, is the most foolish fantasy of liberalism and <br> most perverse illusion spread by revisionism. <br> In the imperialist stage, the superlucur of financial capital is the maximum, exclusive profit of monopolies and <br> Imperialist states. We will start the study of the maximum profit, starting from the economic fundamentals <br> established by Marx and Engels about the relationship between production, circulation and distribution of <br> riches of a society. The capitalist profit and its derivation, the maximum imperialist profit, belong to the <br> Sphere of distribution analyzed by Marx. Understand these foundations of Marxist political economy <br> it is essential to understand why the transformation of free competition capitalism into <br> monopolistic capitalism implies a transformation of the law of profit into the capitalist mode of production, that is, <br> of the transformation of the average profit law into the maximum profit law. <br> The particularity of the capitalist mode of production according to Marx <br> Contrary to what the direction of UOC (MLM) states, imperialism does not result in a qualitative change <br> as to the capitalist mode of production. Generally, the mode of production continues with the same <br> Fundamental characteristics analyzed by Marx. This does not mean that no changes have occurred <br><br><br> qualitative in the sphere of production, on the contrary, it is precisely in this sphere that the modifications begin <br> qualitative analyzed by Lenin, as well as in the sphere of circulation: <br> “Half a century ago, when Marx wrote capital, free competition was for most <br> Economists a 'natural law'. ” [Marx demonstrated] “with a theoretical and historical analysis of the <br> capitalism that competition gives rise to the concentration of production and that said concentration, in <br> A degree of its development leads to the monopoly. Now the monopoly is a fact. ” <br> (Lenin) 280 <br> Monopolistic production and monopoly in the sphere of circulation, key economic characteristics of the time <br> Imperialist, do not change the essence of the capitalist mode of production. So much that the contradiction <br> fundamental of the capitalist process remains between social production and private appropriation, and its <br> Social expression remains the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie. The essence of the process <br> productive remains that highlighted by Marx, in misery of philosophy: “(...) I showed for the first <br> instead that the manufacturing division of work is the specific form of the capitalist mode of production ”281. This <br> is, the segmentation of the production process, of the same act of work, in a succession of partial acts <br> Combined, this is the specific form that the division of labor acquires in the capitalist mode of production. A <br> division of labor is prior to the capitalist mode of production, but it is only in this historical stage, that it <br> acquires the specificity. The division of labor in manufacturing, therefore: “It is a specific creation <br> of the capitalist mode of production ”282. <br> It is this specific form of the capitalist mode of production, prior to the machinery machines, which creates the new <br> social productive force: <br> “The effect of combined work could not be produced by individual work, and it would only be <br> much longer time space or on a very small scale. This is not about the elevation of <br> individual productive force through cooperation, but the creation of a new productive force, the <br> know, the collective force. ” (Marx) 283 <br> The fact that the production process is divided into a planetary scale, of gigantically increasing the <br> Socialization of production, does not correspond to the qualitative change in the productive sphere in the imperialist time. <br> After all, as Marx analyzes, the international division of labor and its consequences had already been taken on <br> Step of free competition, as Marx analyzes: <br> “Making a part of the workers constantly, the modern industry in countries in <br> that is based, stimulates and incites emigration to foreign countries and their colonization, which <br> thus convert into the supplier colonies of raw materials for the Mother, such as Australia, <br> For example, which produces wool. New International Division of Labor is created, appropriate to <br> main centers of modern industry, transforming part of the planet into production areas <br> predominantly agricultural, intended for the other primarily industrial part. ” (Marx) 284 <br> Which are, therefore, the changes in the economic base of imperialism resulting from the colossal concentration <br> of capital? To answer this question, take the analysis of Engels on the development of <br> contradiction between the mode of production and the mode of circulation in capitalism. <br> As we saw in the first section of this text, it is in the work of Engels Anti-Dühring, which appears formulated <br> more completely and developed than the fundamental contradiction of capitalist society is among the<br>social character of production and capitalist private appropriation. Later, in utopian socialism to <br> scientific socialism, Engels would complement this analysis by based on the foundations from which Lenin <br> would formulate his theory of imperialism. In this work, Engels analyzes how the rebellion of the mode of production <br> against the mode of circulation is the base of the overproduction crises and, finally, leads to the conformation of the <br> trustes and monopolies: <br> “In crises burst in violent explosions the contradiction between social production and appropriation <br> capitalist. The circulation of the goods is, for a paralyzed moment. The means of circulation, the <br> money, becomes an absstacle to circulation; all laws of production and circulation of <br> goods have seen the opposite. The economic conflict reaches its culminating point: the mode of <br> Production rebels against the exchange mode. ” (Engels) 285 <br><br><br> This rebellion of the mode of production against the mode of circulation is the requirement of social productive forces <br> for the full recognition of his social and non -private condition: <br> “On the one hand, the capitalist mode of production reveals, therefore, its own inability to continue <br> existing. On the other hand, these productive forces compete with increasing intensity in the <br> sense that the contradiction is resolved, that they are redeemed from their condition of capital, that <br> its character of social productive forces is effectively recognized. ” (Engels) 286 <br> Thus, of this economic conflict between the mode of production and the mode of circulation, important <br> changes in the economic base of capitalist society: <br> “It is this rebellion of the production forces (…) against its quality of capital, this need <br> increasingly imperative that its social character is recognized, which obliges the class itself <br> capitalist to consider them increasingly openly as social productive forces, to the extent <br> where it is possible within capitalist relations. Both periods of high industrial pressure, <br> as its excessive expansion of credit, such as crack itself, with the delay of great <br> capitalist companies, encourage this form of socialization of large masses of means of <br> production we find in the different categories of corporations. ” (Engels) 287 <br> However, more than this formal recognition, the rebellion of social productive forces determines a <br> modification in the content of the mode of circulation in capitalist society: <br> “When reaching a certain phase of development, it is no longer enough for this form; the great <br> national producers of an industrial branch are unite to form a truste, a consortium <br> intended to regulate production determine the total amount that must be produced, <br> Among them and thus impose a sales price in advance fixed. In the trustes, the free <br> competition becomes monopoly and production without the plan of capitalist society capitula <br> before the planned and organized production of the nascent socialist society. ” (Engels) 288 <br> Contradiction between social production and private appropriation invariably in the cyclical crises of <br> overproduction in the capitalist economy; These crises, in turn, imply the rebellion of the mode of production <br> Social against the mode of circulation, free competition. The result of this contradiction is pointed out <br> masterful way by Engels: “free competition becomes a monopoly”, the anarchy of production <br> Capitalist social capitulates in the face of the planned production of the nascent mode of socialist production. The rebellion <br> of social productive forces against the mode of appropriation and the capital circulation mode is already traffic <br> For another regime, as Lenin defines it, fully developing the ideas of the great Engels: <br> “(…) Some of the fundamental properties of capitalism began to become its <br> antithesis (…) what is fundamental in this process, from the economic point of view, is the <br> Substitution of free competition with capitalist monopolies. Free competition is the <br> fundamental property of capitalism and the production of goods in general; the monopoly <br> finds direct opposition with free competition, but the latter became our eyes <br> in monopoly (...). And at the same time, monopolies, which derive from free competition, not <br> eliminate, if not exist on top and next to it, thus engendering a series of contradictions, <br> particularly acute pugnas and conflicts. Monopoly is traffic to a higher regime. (...) The <br> The deepest economic base of imperialism is the monopoly. ” (Lenin) 289 <br> The concentration of production, in the productive sphere, determines the qualitative modification of the circulation mode <br> capitalist. The monopoly imposes itself and dominates, but free competition continues to exist next to and below <br> monopoly; Modifies the stage of the capitalist process. As President Mao points out: in a particular<br>development process or in a given step, the main aspect is one, “but in another stage of the <br> Process, the roles are reversed ”290. Imperialism is not characterized, therefore, as a new mode of <br> Production, therefore, if it was so it would change the process; What happens, however, is a profound change in <br> productive sphere and circulation mode. That is, a superior stage of the development of capitalism. <br> Let's see what other changes in the economic base of society these changes determine. For this, <br> we follow the analysis of Engels about the relationship between production mode, circulation mode and <br> distribution of capitalism. <br> The mode of production and the circulation mode determine the mode of distribution in a society <br><br><br> Marx and Engels elaborate a complete theory of criticism of the capitalist economy, encompassing all their <br> Balls: production, circulation, distribution and consumption; defining the sphere of production as the main <br> therefore, it determines the others, and ultimately, all these spheres as a material basis of the <br> society determines its superstructure. In the introduction to the critique of political economy, Marx analyzes the <br> dialectical relationship between these economic factors, however, this text was not published by <br> founders of communism. Will be in anti-dühring, with an analysis of the relationship between these spheres of the <br> economy, which will more completely present the determination of the mode of distribution by the relationship <br> dialectic between production mode and circulation mode: <br> “(...) it was evident that the whole history there was the history of the class struggle, that these classes of <br> company that fight each other are, in each case, products of production relations and <br> exchange, in short of the economic relations of its time, and that, therefore, each structure <br> economic of society is the real basis, from which it must be explained, ultimately, <br> the entire superstructure of legal and political institutions, as well as the mode of representation <br> religious, philosophical and any nature of each historical period. ” (Engels) 291 <br> Specifies the economic structure of society as production relations and exchange relationships. AND <br> defines political economy as: “The science of laws that govern production and the exchange of sustenance <br> material of life in human society. Production and exchange are two distinct functions. Production can <br> happen without exchange, exchange - precisely because it is in advance only product exchange - cannot <br> happen without production ”292. Rigorously supporting Marx's postulates, shows the dialectical relationship <br> between production and circulation, and at the same time, the ultimate determination of production in relation to <br> the circulation. Thus exemplifies your mutual conditioning: <br> “Each of these two functions [production and circulation] is influenced by external effects in <br> large part specific and, consequently, also has its own laws, its own laws, its <br> specific laws. In contrast, however, one conditions the other at all times and a <br> it is incurred in the other with such intensity that it would be possible to characterize them with the abscissa and the ordained of the <br> economic curve. ” (Engels) 293 <br> Finally, Engels establishes the relationship between both: production and circulation with the mode of distribution of a <br> certain society, that is, how it is distributed among members of the social body, between the social classes <br> of given social formation, the productive results of the set: <br> “With the mode of production and [the mode] of exchange of a particular historical society and with the <br> historical preconditions of this society is also given, simultaneously, the mode of distribution <br> of the products." (Engels) 294 <br> And still: <br> “(…) Distribution is, in each case, the necessary result of the production conditions and exchange of <br> certain society, as well as the historical preconditions of this society and this happens of such <br> way that, knowing these [conditions of production and circulation], we can deduce with <br> conviction the mode of distribution reigning in this society. ” (Engels) 295 <br> We saw earlier that the specific form of the division of capitalist labor is the division of the same act <br> productive in the same manufacturer unit; that this division results in the creation of a productive force <br> new, the collective force, which together with the media social production (the machines) conform to the <br> social production. The mode of circulation proper to capitalist production is free competition. And the mode of <br> distribution or appropriation of the social product is capitalist private property, as Marx defines: “ <br> mode of capitalist appropriation, which derives from the capitalist mode of production, that is, the property <br> capitalist private ”.296 <br> The capitalist distribution mode, or the elements that characterize the bourgeois distribution mode, <br> They have two aspects. The first deals with the distribution of the new value produced in the production process<br>between capital and work. The second, deals with the distribution of the added value appropriate by the capitalist in this <br> same production process, or the distribution of surplus value among the productive branches, of their office in the <br> forms of profit from entrepreneur, interest and land income. <br><br><br> The first law of this mode of distribution is that, as a rule, the worker sells his workforce to <br> capitalist for its exchange value; when buying it this acquires the right to consume the value of use of the <br> work throughout the productive journey. However, the particularity of this commodity ( <br> work) is that the consumption of its use value results in the production of more value. This new value produced <br> by the worker on a journey is divided into two parts: the first is the value necessary for reproduction <br> From its labor force, the second is an excess value. The necessary value corresponds to the salary, <br> the surplus value to the added value appropriate by the capitalist. <br> The second law of the capitalist mode of distribution is the one that deals with the more-value office, according to Marx a <br> surplus value is distributed among capitalists according to the magnitude of their capital, regardless of whether these <br> are employed in productive branches with greater or lesser organic composition of capital. So, one <br> capitalist does not appropriate the surplus value directly by him from his workers. Free circulation <br> of the capital, the free competition between these, determines that the totality of the more social value is divided <br> between capitalists according to a general profit rate. This is the average profit that is earned by the capitalists in the <br> proportion of the magnitude of its capital. <br> According to the analyzes of Engels and Lenin, at the end of the last decade of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, <br> substantial transformations in the productive sphere and capitalist circulation mode occurred. First <br> there is a very high concentration of production, the establishment of trustes and monopolies in certain <br> Branches of the economy, which determine the transformation of free competition into monopoly. According to the <br> Engels dialectical formula, given a mode of production and a mode of circulation it is possible to deduce a <br> corresponding distribution mode. Social production of goods and free competition determine <br> Thus the laws of capitalist distribution. These transformations in the productive sphere and mode of <br> capitalist circulation determine, in turn, modifications in the distribution mode in the monopolistic step <br> of capital, imperialism. What modifications are these and what tell us about this question the great <br> heads of the international proletariat? <br> Two particularities of the mode of distribution in imperialism: permanent overexploitation and profit <br> maximum <br> Lenin very clearly establishes the two modifications in the distribution mode in the imperialist step. <br> Demonstrates how capital concentration, cartels, monopolies, in the sphere of production and the fusion of this <br> inductural capital with bank capital originating financial capital, allows it to earn superluchrs, <br> which are precisely profit above the average profit, thus subverting the law that regulates the distribution of <br> VALUED IN THE CAPITALISM OF THE FREE COMPETITION STEP: “The propitious monopoly Superlukros, that is, an excess <br> of profits over normal, ordinary profits of capitalism around the world. ”297 These profits <br> Monopolists are what he later classifies as “SuperLucros of Finance Capital” 298. <br> Superluchrs in themselves do not constitute an exclusive phenomenon of imperialism, it is a phenomenon <br> common in the stage of free competition in capitalism. Whenever a particular capitalist explores <br> production conditions more favorable than its competitors, it can earn a superlucur <br> Extraordinary value. The determination of the price of a commodity is its value, which corresponds to time <br> socially necessary work to produce it; whenever a capitalist can produce it in a <br> Below the socially needed working time, it can earn a superlucro. However, <br> as soon as these production conditions universalize, such as a new machine or a new method of <br> exploration of proletarian (more intense pace of production, for example), the production time of all <br> Competitors tend to balance and that relative difference is eliminated. Eliminated until a new <br> Method of earning extraordinary added value. The search for extraordinary added value is the main furniture of <br> competition between capitalists of the same productive branch. <br> The particularity of the superlucur at the imperialist time is that it crystallizes as an exclusive form of capital <br> financial, as there are exclusive production conditions that only the capital of the great powers <br> Imperialists, that is, financial capital, can obtain. These production conditions are achieved by<br>imperialism from the export of capital to the oppressed countries, because in these, as Lenin points out: “ <br> capitals are scarce, the price of the earth is relatively small, the wages are low and the raw materials <br><br><br> cockroaches ”299. That is, financial capital can only earn the superlucro establishing monopolistic control <br> of these conditions of production of colonies and semicolonies. <br> As Lenin and Engels highlight, the transformation of free competition into monopoly does not eliminate the <br> competition between the capital. On the contrary, it recruits, if it rises, transforms the commercial wars <br> of the national states of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in the wars of the imperialist powers at the turn of the century <br> XIX to the twentieth century and from this. The financial capital of a power competes with the financial capital of <br> another in the search of these superluchrs, in the dispute for these conditions of production that allow to achieve this <br> benefit. This is the economic base of the world's sharing and departure, the dispute for monopolistic control <br> of the colonies and semicolonies with the looting of their natural riches and the possibility of overexploving <br> permanently your proletariat and other workers. The role of the great local bourgeoisie of countries <br> oppressed, which has become a great bourgeoisie tied to international financial capital, will always be <br> “Subaltern” and Lacaia of this; It is not integrated, it is totally dependent and subdued and accepted in a good way <br> This subjugation. <br> Comrade Stalin, developing Leninism, extracting important economic conclusions after the end of the <br> World War II, it holds a decisive contribution to the analysis of imperialism: <br> “It is said that average profit can, however, be considered quite sufficient for the <br> capitalist development in modern conditions. This is not true. The average profit is the point <br> lower than profitability, below which capitalist production becomes impossible. But it would be <br> Asburdo to think that, when taking colonies, subjugating peoples and architecting wars, the tycoons of <br> Modern monopolistic capitalism are striving to ensure only average profit. No, it's not <br> the average profit, nor the superlucro - which, as a rule, represents only a slight <br> addition to average profit - but precisely the maximum profit that is the engine of capitalism <br> monopolist. ” (Stalin) 300 <br> This is the first particularity of the mode of distribution in the imperialist stage: the objective of the bourgeoisie <br> imperialist, of monopolistic capitalism is not the average profit, nor an ephemeral superlucur, but the <br> Maximum profit. If the economic law of capital in the free competition stage is the search for profit, that of capital <br> Monopolist is the search for maximum profit, that profit above which there can be no other. It is also clear <br> that this maximum profit is monopolized by financial capital, because it is only possible to earn it if it is taken <br> Colonies, subjugate peoples and architect wars. We will deal with other decisions of this established concept <br> by comrade Stalin, but rather we will analyze the other particularity of the distribution mode in the step <br> Imperialist: The permanent overexploitation of the oppressed nations proletariat. <br> As seen earlier, the overexploitation of work, also does not constitute an exclusive stage of the stage <br> Capital monopolist, the imperialist. We saw how brutal form of exploitation arises in England, <br> It is analyzed by Marx and is a way of accelerating capitalist accumulation. However, the continuous <br> Overrexploitation of work has at least two economic and social consequences. Remunerate <br> continuously the workforce below its value, invariably leads to the decaying of the class, and the <br> decreased life expectancy, etc. The capitalist can only adopt this form of exploration if the <br> renewal of an excess overpopulation constant, so this mass outside the labor market, <br> replaces the one that will belating with the continuous overexploitation. The population is an economic factor <br> decisive for overexploitation. <br> On the other hand, continuous overexploitation leads to social explosions of the working class, which prefers to die <br> fighting than perishing hungry under the latego of capitalists. So it was in England, in the nineteenth century, with the <br> hatching of the Cartist Movement and the Trade-Unions, so it was in continental Europe, especially from <br> 1848. Still in the stage of free competition, the monopolistic condition of England in the production of <br> manufactured, until the middle of the nineteenth century, allowed it to earn super students that were used to <br> bribing a certain layer of the working class of your country, aiming to reduce social tensions in your <br> own territory. This phenomenon was carcaten by Marx and Engels as the emergence of a <br> “Workers' aristocracy”. <br> Developing Marxism, Lenin will demonstrate that in the imperialist stage the superlucers earned by the<br>financial capial enable the generalization of this “working aristocracy” in all states of that <br> Shop from countries that oppress the rest of the vast majority of nations in the world. Establishes with this <br><br><br> direct binding of the emergence of imperialism with the temporary predominance of opportunistic control <br> in the workers' movement in oppressive countries. At the same time highlights the impossibility of prolonging for <br> a long time this bribe to this layer of the proletariat. Imperialism is the inevitable tendency for <br> crises, the dispute between the powers for the world's Britile and the competition between corporations <br> monopolists from their respective countries, and this situation also causes instability in the aristocracy <br> worker. <br> In this way, it also occurs in the mode of distribution of the new value created, in the dispute between capital and <br> Work, a change in the laws that prevailed in the free competition stage. While at this stage the <br> overexploitation was transitory, in the imperialist stage it also crystallizes and becomes more or less <br> permanent to the proletariat of the oppressed countries. Imperialism thus imposes a condition of life <br> much worse for the semicolonian proletariat than for the proletariat of imperialist countries. Visa <br> thus obtaining superluchrs with exported capital and “social peace” in their own territory. Search <br> thus, to make part of the proletariat of its complicit country of oppression and national subjugation of countries <br> oppressed. <br> But as seen, overexploitation is not exclusive to the oppressed countries. This in two directions: <br> First, this overexplorated proletariat is a source of added value, mainly for the profit of capital <br> financial and, only to a lesser extent, for the large capital of the oppressed countries; second, the proletariat <br> Of the oppressed countries is also overexploked within the territories of the imperialist powers. Today the <br> existence of the immigrant proletariat is decisive in maintaining industrial production, trade and the sector of <br> services of imperialist countries. There would be no Yankee economy without the presence of the Mexican proletariat, <br> Colombian, finally Latin American and Caribbean in his territory; there would be no German industry without the <br> Turkish and Kurdish proletariat; there would be no trade and service sector in Europe without the India proletariat, <br> Bangladesh, Vietnam, Senegal, Nigeria, Ecuador, Brazil, etc. <br> This mass of immigrant workers is a direct source of surplus value, is overexplored, because the bourgeoisie <br> imperialist takes advantage of his precarious legal condition to impose conditions of demeaning exploration, <br> extracting a much higher rate of added value than from the national proletariat. But to the same <br> time, this immigrant mass serves as a pressure on the country's proletariat, pressing wages to <br> low and allow the dominant classes to foster all kinds of reactionary, chauvinist and <br> Fascist who aims to blame these immigrants by increasing unemployment and relegation of wages. <br> On the one hand, the maximum profit is crystallized as a form of distribution of the financial capital of financial capital; in <br> another, the overexploitation of the proletariat is characterized as a permanent form on the masses of <br> semicolonial countries, are they living in their home countries or working in the territories <br> imperialists. <br> The maximum profit is the economic law of monopolistic capital <br> The maximum imperialist profit is a particular form of the capitalist superlucur. As seen, in the superlucro <br> characteristic of the free competition stage, the capitalists who hold the best conditions of <br> Production earn this form of profit. When these conditions are not subject to monopolization, such as the <br> expansive force of heated water used in the steam machine, resuming the example of Marx, they are <br> Universalisable, they can be used by all competing capitalists; as soon as the condition of <br> Most advantageous production disappears, the superlucro ceases to exist. In the imperialist stage, the superlucro <br> It acquires particular traits that transforms it into the maximum profit. This is because the transformations in the sphere <br> productive determine that the gigantic concentration of capital implies that certain productive branches <br> They can only be exploited in a capitalist manner exclusively by capitals of very high magnitude. A <br> Exploration of these branches thus becomes a monopoly of these extremely concentrated capitals. Lenin, in <br> His study of imperialism points out how this phenomenon appears first in heavy industry; and Engels already <br> It had shown this particularity necessary for capitalism in the construction of railways, for example. <br> The monopolistic exploitation of capital was expanded in the whole branches of the economy <br> Qualitative modification in the mode of circulation, free competition has become the monopoly. O <br> superlucrum that was ephemeral among free-competitive capitalists in the same branch of production,<br>initially crystallizes, in certain productive branches, in these that can only be explored by <br><br><br> gigantic quantities of concentrated capital. In these branches the superlucur of financial capital is <br> transforms the maximum profit characteristic of imperialism. Lenin gives us two examples of the constitution of <br> monopolies in the industrial production of sugar and cement: <br> “(...) The sugar cartel set monopoly prices and received so much profit that it could pay a dividend <br> (...) almost 70% of the capital effectively contributed to the cartel! ”(Lenin) 301 <br> AND: <br> “(...) where it is possible to seize all or the most important sources of raw materials, the <br> Cartels and the constitution of monopolies are particularly easy. But it would be a <br> error to think that monopolies also do not arise in other branches of production, in which the <br> Conquest of sources of raw materials is impossible. The cement industry finds raw materials <br> cousins everywhere. However, this industry is also very portalized in Germany. (...) <br> Govern monopoly prices: from 230 to 280 mark the wagon, when the production cost is 180 <br> frames!" (Lenin) 302 <br> The sugar cartel allowed a 70%profit rate after the cartel constitution; the cement industry <br> portalized, in turn, allows much higher monopoly prices than normally about <br> production costs. This stabilization of the superlucro, initially in certain productive branches and soon <br> Then, in all branches, it indicates its transformation into the maximum profit. How Engels makes clear <br> relationship between production mode and circulation with the distribution mode is not passive, as one determines the <br> Development of the other: “Distribution is not a simple passive result of production and exchange; with <br> The same intensity, it retroacts on both ”303, so it is necessary to see in detail the implications <br> of this modification in the economic base as a whole in the imperialist stage. <br> What is the result of the monopoly price of the cement cartel? Where sugar cartel can extract this <br> Superlucro? Marx demonstrates in detail in the book I of The Capital, that profit cannot be explained from <br> of the sphere of circulation. That is, the fact that a producer sells his goods for a price above his <br> Value, cannot socially explain profit. As he demonstrates, in capitalist production, the only source of <br> Profit is added value, it is the unpaid work, extracted from the worker through the hassle production relationship. <br> This does not change in the imperialist step. The question, however, is that the added value appropriate by a <br> Capitalist is not the added value produced immediately by the workers he explores. As seen above, the <br> Profit of a capitalist is mediated by the sharing of the entire social value produced; is more- <br> value is divided among the different branches of production, between the different forms of capital (industrial, <br> banking and commercial), among the different forms of profit (profit of entrepreneur, interest and land income), <br> according to the general profit rate in given society. <br> From the point of view of the relationship between value and price, the distribution of surplus value in the free stage <br> Competition occurs, according to Marx's formulations, as follows. Different capitalists, <br> that produce the same merchandise, that is, which are direct competitors, manufacture in different conditions <br> of production. The working time necessary for the production of the goods varies, therefore, as they are <br> these conditions, the capitalist who holds the best condition produces in a shorter time necessary, which <br> It has the worst condition consumes a longer time. The value of the goods, however, is not defined by the <br> unique conditions of production, but by socially necessary working time. The social value of <br> Industrial goods is determined by the average production conditions of competing capitalists. <br> In the next topic, we will see that the laws that determine the social value of agricultural goods and <br> extractivists are different from industrial goods, in agriculture is not the average condition that <br> determines social value, but the condition of the worst land, but this is a point that needs an analysis <br> part. Let us proceed in the analysis of the production price of industrial goods. <br> The social value is the productive basis that determines the price of the product in the market. Under the social value, the <br> laws governing the distribution of social value, in the case of the free competition stage operates the profit law <br> average. Then the production price of a commodity is equal to social value, or production costs, more <br> the average profit. The producer with lower production costs, as already rescheduled, will earn an excess profit, <br> which does not constitute the form of particular profit of the monopolistic stage of capital, imperialism. <br> What happens in imperialism, as indicated in Lenin's examples, is that initially in some branches<br>productive, the final capital imposes a monopoly price, that is, a price above the production price <br><br><br> thus ensuring a profit higher than the average profit. This surplus profit cannot emerge simplemete <br> From exchange, it therefore implies a modification in the distribution of surplus value. That is, the branches of <br> production that can impose on society a monopoly price appropriates a greater portion of the <br> Social value than the capitalists of the other branches. Thus, the monopolistic profit of a branch implies <br> a profit below the average profit in the other branches. Lenin reschedule this modification of the more <br> VALLEY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTIVE BRADS IN THE IMPERIALIST STEP when it says that: <br> "(...) The 'heavy industry' receives a tribute from all other industrial branches." (Lenin) 304 <br> Before we analyze the sources that ensure the payment of this tax to the monopolized branches, it is <br> it is necessary <br> of the monopoly of financial capital in production, this condition determines the existence of different rates <br> of profit in the imperialist stage of capitalism. There is no maximum profit for all <br> capitals because the monopolistic profit of a productive branch will always be at the expense of decreasing the rate of <br> Non -monopolized branches profit. However, with the progressive sagging of the productive branches <br> by financial capital, one by one, they fall under their domain and become branches <br> monopolized. When this happens, imperialist superluchrs, or maximum profit, cease to exist? <br> No, “the maximum profit is the engine of monopolistic capitalism” and so in imperialism competition <br> far from disappearing becomes the disadvantaged rivalry of the imperialist powers and between <br> corporations from their respective countries in search of this monopolistic profit. The maximum profit, by its nature <br> Monopolist, is excluding and can only arise from the violent defeat of the competitor, “in the use of dynamite” 305 <br> against this and the growing subjugation of colonial and semicolonal possessions. How the great <br> Lenin: <br> “Imperialism is monopolistic capitalism. Each cartel, each truste, each consortium, each bank <br> Gigantic is a monopoly. Superlukers did not disappear, but they go on. A <br> exploitation by a privileged, financially rich country, of all others follows and is even more <br> intense. A handful of rich countries - are in total four, if one takes into account a wealth <br> independent and truly gigansca, a 'modern' wealth: England, France, the States <br> United and Germany - has extended monopolies in unachaled proportions, obtain hundreds, <br> if not billions, of superlucros, 'lives exploring' to hundreds and hundreds of millions of men of <br> Other countries, among intestinal struggles for sharing a Botín, the most sumptuous, abundant, easy. In that <br> it consists in prceously the economic and political essence of imperialism, whose very deep <br> Kautsky contradictions hides instead of putting them to discovered. ”(Lenin) 306 <br> Maximum profit, therefore, is only possible for a handful of countries that live exploring the billions of men <br> and women from all other countries. This is the engine of monopolistic capitalism, because the maximum profit, <br> as a result of the development of the added value law became the law that regulates the distribution in the <br> Imperialist stage. As stalin establishes: <br> “Is the law of value the basic economic law of capitalism? No . The law of value is mainly a <br> Commodity Production Law. (...) The law of value, of course, plays a big role in <br> Development of capitalist production. But not only does not determine the essence of production <br> capitalist and the principles of capitalist profit; It doesn't even have these problems. therefore, no <br> It may be the basic economic law of modern capitalism. ” (Stalin) 307 <br> AND: <br> “The most appropriate for the concept of a basic economic law of capitalism is the law of <br> Valiated, the law of origin and growth of capitalist profit. It really determines the characteristics <br> basic capitalist production. But the added law is a very general law; Don't cover the problem <br> of the highest profit rate (...) the added value law must be realized and developed even more in the <br> adaptation to the conditions of monopolistic capitalism ”. (Stalin) 308 <br> Maximum profit is the law that determines the monopoly price and the distribution of surplus value in imperialism. <br> Let us now analyze some of the sources that feed this imperialist profit. <br> Maximum profit as a social tax paid to financial capital <br><br><br> The expansion of monopoly to all productive branches of the world economy does not make the <br> Superluch. While the cartoons and trusts were exclusive to the branches of the heavy industry, it received a<br>Tribute of other productive branches. When the monopoly is generalized, this tribute is paid by the <br> Set of the Society: <br> “Financial capital, concentrated in very few hands and enjoying the effective monopoly, obtains <br> a huge profit that increases without ceasing with the constitution of companies, issuance of values, <br> state loans, etc., consolidating the domination of the financial oligarchy and imposing the whole <br> society a tribute for the benefit of monopolists. ” (Lenin) 309 <br> The surplus profit of financial capital in relation to what would be the average profit of the free competition stage <br> It is composed of this tax imposed by the financial oligarchy to every company in its benefit. The source <br> main of this tribute is found in the colonies and semicolonies and, as already seen, it is one of the <br> Economic fundamentals of the fight for the world's mastery among the imperialist powers. Each one wants <br> Ensure the best production conditions of this maximum profit. For this reason, Lenin points out that: <br> “The struggle between the world imperialists is sharpened. Increases the tribute that financial capital <br> receives from colonial and overseas companies, particularly profitable. ” (Lenin) 310 <br> All the militarization of imperialism, the whole tendency to violence, is based and justified by the race <br> unbridled by the maximum profit. Therefore, it is a total of contract the conclusion of the direction of the <br> UOC (mlm) that semicolonial bourgeoisie would increase a profit rate equal to the profit rate of <br> imperialist bourgeoisie. After all, as the comrade Stalin clarifies: <br> “It is precisely the need to ensure maximum profits that leads to monopolistic capitalism <br> to risky developments such as slavery and systematic looting of colonies and other countries <br> late, the conversion of a number of independent countries in dependent countries, the <br> organization of new wars - which for the tycoons of modern capitalism is the best business <br> adapted to the extraction of the maximum profit - and, finally, tries to conquer economic supremacy <br> worldwide. ” (Stalin) 311 <br> It is the search for the maximum profit that explains the aggravation of national oppression in the imperialist stage, the <br> conversion of independent countries in dependent countries. And we have seen Lenin's explanation what are the <br> economic reasons that allow the capital exported from imperialist countries to earn superlukers in <br> semicolonial countries, after all in these: “The capital is scarce, the price of the earth is relatively small, the <br> low wages and cheap raw materials ”312. To understand the relationship between the low price of the earth and <br> Cheap raw materials, we need to treat before the Marxist theory of land income, so <br> We will analyze this aspect in the next session. We will deal with the other two elements here: scarce capital and <br> low salaries. <br> In discussing the transformations of the mode of dysruption in the imperialist stage, we have already addressed the issue of <br> overexploitation of the proletariat of the oppressed nations, whether they are working in their nations or how <br> immigrants in imperialist countries. It is necessary to highlight that the permanent overexploitation of the <br> Proletariat of the oppressed nations is the main source of the maximum profit of financial capital. That is, that <br> of this tax paid by the whole company to the financial oligarchy most is the proletariat of countries <br> oppressed. As Lenin points out in analyzing the phenomenon of the working aristocracy in imperialist countries: <br> “In the economic aspect, the difference is that a part of the working class of oppressive countries <br> receives the crumbs of the superluchrs that obtain the bourgeois of the oppressive nations through the <br> Redoced permanent exploitation of the workers of the oppressed nations. Economic data <br> They prove, moreover, that the percentage of workers who become 'supervisors' in the oppressive nations <br> It is larger than in the oppressed nations, which is greater the percentage that is incorporated into the workers' aristocracy. <br> This is a fact. The workers of an oppressive nation are to some extent accomplices of their bourgeoisie, <br> in the looting of workers (and the mass of the population) of the oppressed nation. ” (Lenin) 313 <br> This passage from Lenin is very important because it highlights the character of the extra exploration <br> permanent on the workers of the oppressed nations; because it highlights that this overexploitation is the source of <br> Superluchrs, which shares the crumbs with the working aristocracy; because it emphasizes the exploration not only <br><br><br> workers but the masses of the population of the oppressed nations; and because it binds this overexploitation of the <br> Proletariat and national oppression of imperialism to the complicit opportunism of financial capital. <br> The other element highlighted by Lenin to obtain superlucers in the oppressed countries is the scarcity of <br> capital. That is, the financial capital, when exported, found in the colonial and semicolonial countries <br> Capitals of little magnitude, in a very initial process of accumulation. This limited accumulation of<br>local capitals impossible to competition with financial capital, after all the conditions of production <br> resulting from the unprecedented concentration of capital in advanced countries become exclusive monopoly <br> of financial capital. To the large capitals accumulated in the colonial and semicolonial countries, the capital <br> financially put two situations before them: to go the path of national development in a <br> unequal competition with them with all the consequences of a confrontation or to be aware of these <br> as minions to continue accumulating as complications of national subjugation and <br> overexploitation of its source proletariat. In the twentieth century, already in force of imperialism ended the <br> time of the world bourgeois democratic revolution and entry at the time of the world proletarian revolution, <br> rule, the great bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries was compelled to the second path, in rare exceptions <br> For the first and invariably faced imperialist military retaliation. <br> This company of subjugation of financial capital with the accumulated capital of the great bourgeoisie and the <br> landlord of colonies and semicolonies is one of the most important economic traits that transit the <br> Economic-social formations in the countries oppressed in the imperialist stage. This condition was called by <br> May President of Bureaucratic Capitalism, that is, a capitalism that did not go through a <br> revolutionary, democratic development, but developed linked to financial capital, combined with <br> imperialism and local landlord. This great bourgeoisie, bureaucratic and buyer, is a subordinate part, <br> but indispensable of financial capital. It is under its direct responsibility to impose the overexploitation of the <br> proletariat of the oppressed nations. The political conditions necessary to ensure this exploitation, in these <br> Oppressed countries are generally and almost invariably fascism. They are centralization political regimes <br> absolute state power in the executive, in which the reactionary armed forces exert the guardianship <br> permanent of civil shift governments or direct control via military regimes, in situations <br> ascending revolutionaries. <br> These are more or less common traits to semicolonial countries around the world. From the point of view of <br> profit earned by this bureaucratic and buying bourgeoisie, it is evident that it cannot be the same as the <br> financial capital; However, it cannot be too low, after all, the great semicolonial bourgeoisie <br> It fulfills indispensable functions to imperialism and is returned for it. It is therefore a large <br> monopolistic bourgeoisie, not in the world market, but in the national market and in some <br> cases, in a very limited way, in a regional market. Controls through the old state device all <br> foreign trade, monopolizing the import and export of goods in association with capital <br> financial. Controls the country's industry, through state or non-state captital, based on maintenance <br> landlord and monopolistic relationships of ownership, monopoly and concentration of the land, all tied <br> to international financial capital. For all this receives fractional values much lower than profit <br> imperialist of the financial oligarchy, gains that allow them to reproduce as a great bourgeoisie <br> Monopolist, bureaucratic and buying, dominant in the control of the state apparatus. <br> This great bureaucratic bourgeoisie buying the oppressed countries, so it does not earn maximum profit, <br> But together with financial capital restricts the profit of the national bourgeoisie (average bourgeoisie). And in doing so <br> It earns a monopolistic profit from this non-monopolistic bourgeoisie. The production of this average <br> bourgeoisie always occurs on a reduced scale and being unable to compete with local monopolies and <br> foreigners, in general, serves as auxiliary to the enterprises of the great bourgeoisie and in the supply <br> of goods and services secondary to the state. Its profit rate is incomparably lower than the <br> of financial capital and far below the great bureaucratic and buyer bourgeoisie. From the point of view <br> politician lacks the privileges obtained by the bureaucratic and comprodora bourgeoisie, either as the exemption of <br> Taxes, access to state credits and import quotas or policies that facilitate export. AND <br> a bourgeoisie that also oversees the proletariat of its country, but has no economic strength to <br> Age nor the average profit, in addition to competing in a fully monopolized domestic market. <br> An important part of the asset that extracts from its workers is drained by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and <br> buyer and financial capital. It is a bourgeoisie restricted by financial capital and capitalism <br><br><br> bureaucratic, it does not even reach the average profit; the share of the added value that would fit him by the laws of free<br>Competition are drained by the monopoly to compose the maximum imperialist profit. The national bourgeoisie <br> (average bourgeoisie) earns a minimum profit and therefore has contradictions with bureaucratic capitalism and with <br> Imperialism. However, as its profit comes from the overexploitation of the proletariat - which fears. AND <br> economically dependent on imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism and landlord, so it is a <br> Economically and politically hesitable weak class; but that, for its contradictions with imperialism, <br> with the great local bourgeoisie and the landlord tends to support the national democratic struggle, whose program of <br> single revolutionary front must ensure their interests and can thus be neutralized and, in determined <br> conditions, and for a certain time to have an active partition of their sectors, especially when the war <br> Revolutionary obliges the imperialist invasion of the national territory. <br> Overexploitation of the proletariat of the oppressed nations and the restriction of the profit of national bourgeoisie <br> Two sources of the maximum profit of financial capital. The first is the main source; the second most important, <br> as we will see below is constituted by the election by Lenin as low prices of land and <br> Cheap cousins. As we have seen, it was the changes in the production sphere and the circulation mode in the <br> transit of the free competition stage for the monopolist who determined the modification of the mode of <br> distribution in the capitalist economy. The distribution of the new value created in the productive act has, <br> fundamentally, two different rates of added value: the workers of the oppressed nations and the <br> Working aristocracy in oppressive countries. The distribution of surplus value, in turn, is due to different <br> Profit rates: the maximum profit of financial capital, that is, imperialist, the monopolistic profit of the great <br> bureaucratic bourgeoisie and buyer of the oppressed countries and the minimum profit of the national bourgeoisie (average <br> bourgeoisie) of the colonies and semicolonies. <br> Finally, it is important to highlight that the existence of different profit rates, according to the magnitude of the <br> capital, it was already a reflection of Marx and Engels that appears even in the study of capitalism of the free stage <br> competition. This is what we can see in the following note of Engels: <br> “In Marx's personal use of personal use we found the following margin note:‘ to develop <br> Later: If the expansion is purely quantitative, profits in the same business <br> in relation to the large and small capitals, in accordance with the magnitudes of <br> advanced capital. If the quantitative expansion results in a qualitative change, the rate of <br> profit increases simultaneously to greater capital '. ” (Engels) 314 <br> In the same way, the study of maximum profit conditions are already an old object of study of the economy <br> policy. In the economic and philosophical manuscripts, of 1844, for example, Marx cites the following passage of <br> Adam Smith: <br> “The highest rate to which the usual gains can be climbed is the one that, in most <br> goods, extracts all land income and reduces the salary of the goods produced to <br> lower price, merely subsistence of the worker during work. The worker has <br> whenever it is fed, in one way or another, while being used in a work <br> daily; Land income can be entirely suppressed. Example: in cane, the staff of <br> Indian Company of Commerce ... ”. (Adam Smith apud Marx) 315 <br> That is, according to Smith the maximum profit rate can be obtained when the salary is reduced to the minimum, and <br> when land income is entirely suppressed. Presents us as an example of these conditions <br> Bengal, when he was still a colony of England. In this topic we study the relationship between the maximum profit <br> imperialist and the overexploitation of the oppressed nations proletariat. Next we will study the <br> mechanisms of suppression of land income in semicolonies as a fundamental part for conformation <br> maximum profit of financial capital. <br> 2. Land income in semicolonial countries at the time of imperialism <br> To analyze the process of land income in semicolonial countries in the imperialist time, it is necessary <br> assimilate the Marxist theory of capitalist land income. Without mastering this theory well becomes <br> impossible to understand the phenomenon today, in these countries that are the vast majority in the world, well <br> as the development of this process in the stage of monopolistic capitalism. As Marx makes clear, the <br> formulation of its theory of land capitalist income, part of the specific case of England, because they were <br><br><br> English conditions that modern land ownership “had its proper development” 316. And in <br> England, the classic form of bourgeois land property developed, this allowed Marx to formulate <br> The most universal theory about this complex and crucial issue of political economy. Departing, therefore, of<br>Smith and Ricardo's formulations, but above all, Marx conceives his theory of land income <br> capitalist. <br> Mastering this theory is key to correctly applying it to different particular conditions of England. <br> Particular distinctions of time (we are in the monopolistic stage of capitalism) and place, in this case the <br> Latin America, whose Genesis of economic and social formations is very different from the English. Among these <br> particularities stand out: a more recent colonization, the vastness of the territory and the little <br> industrial capitalist development. Marx himself, in his formulations, toasts the proletariat of <br> semicolonial countries, germ analyzes of land income from the agro -export of America, so <br> as the particularities of the land income of peasants when linked to a capitalist market. <br> These are very important starting points for understanding current phenomena; however, <br> demand theoretical development by the international proletariat. After all, income theory <br> Marx's land was formulated at a stage of the capitalist process in which they still did not predominate <br> large monopolies in production, in which free competition conducts the circulation of capital and the average profit <br> It was the Law of the Office of Mais-Valia. These conditions, as Lenin and Stalin establish, change the <br> From the twentieth century, what are its impacts on the functioning of land income in the imperialist stage? <br> This is an issue that must be answered, theoretical and practically by MCI, because it is implied in it <br> understanding of the relations of particular exploitation of the imperialist stage, as well as part of the foundation <br> economic of national oppression and the overexploitation of the proletariat and the peasant <br> oppressed today. Our party, amid the present fight of two lines in MCI, hopes to contribute <br> with your resolution. <br> <br> In its critical magazine to LCI and, in particular, to our party, UOC (MLM) addresses the issue <br> characterizing pejoratively as “supporters of semi -feudality theory” 317. Many epipytes many <br> sometimes make toxic the struggle of two lines, but we accept this characterization, with quotes, is <br> of course, because the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist characterization and that of UOC (MLM) can only be opposite, even though <br> we have no idea what our UOC critics (MLM) understand by “theory of <br> semi -feudality ”. As Marxist-Leninist-Maoists, we are supporters of the theory of feudality and <br> semi -feudality, as are the heads of the international proletariat: Presidente Mao, President Gonzalo, <br> Ibrahim Kaypakkaya, Charu Mazudar and José Maria Sison. We defend this conception because scientific and <br> true, in addition to decisive to make the revolution in the colonial and semicolonial countries. <br> After launching us this “epipyto”, the direction of UOC (MLM) argues that there would be a “coincidence of theory <br> semi -feudality with neoliberalism theorists regarding soil capitalist income ”318. <br> Comparing the theory of the May President of Semi -Feudality with “neoliberal” positions is at least one <br> Failure, don't understand well what one thing is and another. They claim, for example, that: <br> “One of the main errors of the supporters of semi -feudality theory is due to the confusion of the concept <br> absolute soil income. Fact, of course, coincident with theses of the theorists of neoliberalism. In <br> Such theorization, the lender farmer is considered indistinctly of the worker <br> wage earner, with the only difference that the first salary is not effective except in kind. <br> These gentlemen completely ignore the fact that the lessee owns their means of production, <br> Invert capital, control the work process and make production decisions. ” [UOC (MLM)] 319 <br> They claim that, like neoliberal theorists, we do not understand the concept of absolute income; what <br> For us, the tenant peasant would be considered indistinctly as a wage worker; is that <br> We would ignore the fact that the peasant controls the work process. The theoretical confusion of UOC (MLM) is <br> complete, because the neoliberal theorists do not consider the peasant render as a wage earner, the <br> Yes, they consider it as a “partner” of the great owners who earn profit sharing. It is <br> It is the liberal and neoliberal conception of the partnership relations analyzed previously. In relation to <br> Two other points, Marx is extremely clear in his capitalist land income theory: the peasant <br> It earns absolute income, not even when you own your installment, much less when you are a lessee; <br> Moreover, it does not control the work process, but is controlled and oppressed by it. <br><br><br> The direction of UOC (MLM), yes, assumes a bourgeois liberal economic position when considering the <br> peasants as typical capitalist tenants:<br>“For them [semi -feudality theorists], this lessee is a non -free and indigent worker, and <br> Not a capitalist lessee who has means of production. Capital must be brought by <br> Latifundry and the partner only presents labor. This indigent partner only receives a salary <br> Dad and the landowner gets an income (as expressed Ricardo!). But if we fix well, the <br> that these theorists call 'salary' is actually the profit of the capitalist lessee. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 320 <br> In this criticism, they deny only their theoretical indigence, as it does not understand the formulation of the <br> Semi -feudality, neither of “neoliberalism”, much less Ricardo's theory of land income. After all, for <br> Ricardo the lessee in no way receives a “dulling salary”, on the contrary, always receives the profit <br> average. The error in Ricardo's theory of income, revealed by Marx, is that he could not explain the income <br> land of the worst land, that is, absolute income, key theoretical question solved only by <br> Marxist political economy. In addition, in this position of reached January 2023, the UOC (MLM) <br> contradicts its own formulation presented in its program, published in 2015. As we saw in its <br> analysis of the development of capitalism in agriculture in semicolonial countries, UOC (MLM), there are few <br> years ago, he considered the partnership relationship as a covered, feudal -looking range, <br> but of salary in practice. Remember the direction of UOC (MLM) its old formulation: <br> “The partnership (…) became a type of capitalist exploration of the land. It is <br> Production salaried relationship remains disguised with the old cloak of the partner. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 321 <br> Today, in his critique of our party, he reformulates his position to say that the partnership relationship in <br> agriculture of semicolonial countries is a relationship between a capitalist lessee and a owner of <br> lands. Above we demonstrate that the partnership relationship is not a pure salaried such as the direction of <br> UOC (MLM) previously defended, however, even less can be considered a profit relationship <br> Capitalist of the lender peasant. Treat the exploration relationship, covered in the partnership, as a profit <br> capitalist, this is the most shameful “neoliberal” conception, which seeks to transform all exploited <br> by capital in entrepreneurs, small business owners, etc. This is what is defended by treating the peasants <br> as capitalist tenants: <br> “The peasant lease produces surpluses in the leased farm with family labor and <br> hired. Part of this surplus transfers to the owner in the form of income, another part to <br> Settlement/creditor and the rest pockets as a profit. ” [UOC (MLM)] 322 <br> For UOC (MLM) the relationship of the lender peasant with the landlord is the typically capitalist. <br> Therefore, this capitalist peasant hires workforce, pays the lease of the land to the landlord and <br> pockets the profit that fits you. Thus, the lease paid by the peasant to the landlord is an income <br> capitalist land, the yield earned by the peasant with the sale of his production is a profit <br> capitalist and the amount paid to the contracted labor is a capitalist wage. These <br> Conclusions are in full opposition to the foundations of Marxist political economy. One of the criticisms of <br> Marx to Ricardo is that this, like the bourgeois political economists in general, saw in <br> Capitalist relations of production “natural” relationships that have always existed and will always exist. So that <br> For Ricardo every land lease was a capitalist land income. It's UOC (mlm), <br> Therefore, that repeats Ricardo's mistakes. Marx states that: <br> “Ricardo, after supposing bourgeois production as necessary to determine income, applies it, <br> However, the land property of all the time and all countries. This is the error of all <br> Economists, who present bourgeois production relations as eternal categories. ” (Marx) 323 <br> Marx demonstrates that taking the peasants by capitalist tenants is a huge theoretical error; and if this <br> It was already a mistake in the stage of free competition, in the monopolistic phase of capital is completely out of <br> reality. UOC (MLM) is advocating here is that a tenant peasant, after marketing its <br> goods, receives a capitalist profit. Neither does it seem absurd or strange that he uses labor <br> familiar (without salaried remuneration) for production. All of this is presented by UOC (MLM), pure and <br><br><br> simply as capitalist relations of production. Marx had already clarified this issue <br> Patent, when analyzing the lease paid by the peasants of Ireland: <br> “This is what happens for example in Ireland. The lessee there is as a rule a small peasant. What <br> it pays to the landowner for lease often absorbs not only part of the profit,<br>that is, from the surplus work itself that is entitled as the owner of the production instruments, but <br> also part of the normal salary that in other conditions would receive for the same amount of <br> work." (Marx) 324 <br> That is, when the lessee is a peasant, the lease paid to the land owner absorbs not only <br> profit, but also part of the salary, that is, the peasant lesser receives less that he would receive for <br> Even work if it were a wage earner. It is in this ruined peasant, with a worse life condition than <br> that of agricultural wage earners, which UOC (MLM) wants to see a “capitalist rental”. Marx shows, to <br> contrary, that there is no capitalist land income in peasant leasing, that it exists only <br> formally: <br> “The landowner can also lease it to a worker who agrees to pay him in <br> Form of income the total or most of what it earns, above salary, with the lease price. <br> In all these cases but there is no income, although lease is paid. But where <br> There are the conditions corresponding to the capitalist mode of production, income and lease to pay <br> must coincide. ” (Marx) 325 <br> As we will see ahead, capitalist land income only exists as surplus above the average profit <br> established in an economy. For Marx, if the lessee does not earn this average profit, and how <br> lease subtracts part of what would be your salary, or part of what your profit would be, this lease <br> It is not a capitalist land income. UOC (mlm) completely ignores this issue and even comes to <br> Synthesize a new category of political (non -Marxist) political economy: the “capitalist peasant landowner”: <br> “Thus, capitalist agriculture may be dominated by the capitalist Rentest <br> (CRLL for its) or the Capitalist Peasant Latiface (CFLL), depending on <br> production conditions. ”[UOC (MLM)] 326 <br> To what point there is! How capitalist agriculture may be dominated by the “peasant landowner <br> capitalist"? Depending on the conditions, a landowner can become a capitalist at the same time; It is <br> that under more specific conditions a peasant can also become capitalist. But like a <br> Can a great owner be at the same time a small owner? Above we saw Marx's criticism <br> Proudhon, for the synthesis that he made two arbitrary concepts to build “new” categories <br> economic; UOC (MLM), following the "dialectical" steps of Proudhon and Pachanda, gets the feat of <br> integrate three in one, to synthesize the concept of “capitalist peasant landowner” and still toast <br> with your "acronym in English". <br> Even after they do this “dialectical” juggling, the direction of UOC (MLM) continues to insist that we <br> “Theorists of semi -feudality”, we do not understand “the concept of absolute income” 327. Let's see how, how <br> It is understood some key concepts of the Marxist theory of capitalist land income. For UOC (mlm) <br> capitalist differential income can be defined as follows: <br> “Differential income is born or the natural fertility of land and its favorable location (income <br> differential i) or successive inversions of capital in the same land (differential income II). ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 328 <br> Already the absolute income, it defines it: <br> “Absolute income is born from the monopoly of territorial property - it is the tax that pays society to <br> monopoly of private land property ”. [UOC (MLM)] 329 <br> UOC (MLM) starts from the false assumption that the capitalist differential income “is born” of the difference of <br> fertility or work accumulation in the same land; In the same way it defines that absolute income <br> “Born” of the monopoly of land ownership. Thus, it confuses factors of land income with its Genesis. <br> Capitalist land income is born from the capitalist mode of production, which arises in manufactures and, <br><br><br> Subsequently, advance to the field. That is why Marx states that the factors fertility and location are <br> “Independent of Capital” 330. <br> The difference in soil economic fertility and its limitation are part of the objective base of land income <br> capitalist, but do not correspond to their particularity, as these factors also acted from different <br> forms in other modes of production. Since the most remote times of humanity, the most fertile lands <br> and better localized (close to rivers, for example), constituted determining economic factors of <br> production. What matters to know, for understanding the Marxist theory of land income, is like these <br> Factors act under the domain of capitalist production. That is, what constitutes the particularity of income <br> Earth capitalist. <br> By advancing in its explanation, UOC (MLM) states that: <br> “(...) Differential income is an extraordinary profit that does not emerge as a quality of the land itself, <br> if not the use of this by the capital; It is an income that comes from the exploitation of work <br> wage earner in agriculture. ” [UOC (MLM)] 331<br>In the above quote corrects the previous statement about the “birth” of income, but now, it misses that the <br> Income comes from the exploitation of wage labor in agriculture. Wage labor in agriculture, a <br> of the fundamentals of capitalist production, explains the extraction of surplus value in the field, but in no way <br> explains the capitalist land income. Because it does not consist of added value in general, but in a branch <br> This benefits the landowner; This is what the owner of the land extracts from the capitalist and not directly from the <br> agricultural worker, that is, is part of the (social) added value from the city and country workers <br> by the general bourgeoisie that the capitalist in agriculture pays income to the landlord and this consists of <br> particularity that needs to be explained. For Marx, the explanation of capitalist income cannot be <br> confuse with the explanation of surplus value in general: <br> “In the analysis of income, the whole difficulty was, therefore, to explain the surplus of profit <br> agricultural on average profit, not the added value but the specific supplemental value of this <br> production branch ”. (Marx) 332 <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) is not unaware that capitalist land income consists of a profit surplus <br> agricultural about the average profit, it even states that: <br> “The capitalist relations of production that developed in Colombian agriculture, originate a <br> surplus of agricultural profit on average profit. This surplus is soil income. In appearance to <br> Income arises from the earth, as if it should be inherent in the earth. ”[UOC (MLM)] 333 <br> CORRECT, capitalist land income consists of the surplus of agricultural profit over average profit, is what says <br> Marx. But UOC (MLM) states that in Colombian agriculture were capitalist production relations <br> that originated this surplus; It is assumed to be what you should demonstrate in your conclusion. <br> Need to answer the following economic questions: Colombian peasant production earns the profit <br> Capitalist medium? The lease paid by the Colombian peasants to the landowners is a value <br> surplus to this average profit? To answer these concrete questions, however, it is necessary to explain <br> theoretically what is the mechanism that gives rise to this surplus profit in agricultural production above the profit <br> and because this surplus is appropriate by the landowner and not by the capitalist who explores the <br> ground. However, UOC (mlm) cannot do so, as it starts from two important errors: first, consider <br> that income “is born” of the difference in fertility and land limitation, as stated above; second, <br> It considers that income comes directly and exclusively on the wage earnings of agricultural workers. <br> The complexity of the problem of capitalist land income is that it is the result of the mode of production, <br> circulation mode and capitalist distribution mode. So Marx could only approach it in the book III of The <br> Capital, because there studies the relationship between these two aspects of capital: production and circulation, as well as the <br> distribution of added value resulting from this contradiction. Thus, differential fertility and land limitation, <br> constitute particular factors of agricultural production, however, are insufficient to explain the income <br> capitalist. Because it is also formed by the general profit rate, or average profit (distribution of surplus value); <br> and by a particular law of the capitalist circulation of agricultural products: the market price of these <br> Goods is regulated by the production price of the worst terrain. Marxist theory of land income <br><br><br> Capitalist demands the understanding of three spheres of political economy: production, circulation and distribution. <br> In production, exploration relations, differential fertility and soil limitation; in circulation, the worst <br> land determining the market price; in distribution, the relationship between average profit and production <br> capitalist in agriculture. <br> 2.1- The Marxist Theory of Capitalist Land Income <br> Marx points out that all land income, that is, all payment for the use of land or all <br> received exclusively for owner of a portion of the globe, all this income is a <br> part of the surplus work produced by society. In this sense, land income in the mode of production <br> Slave, feudal and capitalist constitute part of surplus work. The particular trait of land income <br> capitalist is that it is a part of this excess work above the average profit earned by the <br> bourgeoisie. Therefore, Marx states that “all land income is surplus, surplus work product. (...) <br> But in the capitalist mode of production, land income is always left above profit ”334. In capitalism, <br> surplus work is surplus value, so capitalist land income is a particular branch of <br> Social value that is appropriate by landowners. And landowners appropriate<br>of this part of the added value, solely and exclusively for being owned of land, inherited, inherited, <br> conquered or purchased, but not resulting from human labor as the other means of <br> Production (tools, machines, etc.). Marx highlights this power of landowners in <br> appropriate part of the social value: <br> “The peculiar characteristic is that, with the conditions under which agricultural products <br> develop as values (goods) and with the conditions under which these values are realized, <br> the power of the land owner develops to appropriate the growing portion of these <br> values created without its interference, and increasing portion of surplus value becomes income <br> Land. ” (Marx) 335 <br> Marx also emphasizes that: <br> “Income then represents part of the value, more particularly of the surplus value of the goods, the <br> which instead of fit the capitalist class that took it from the workers, belongs to the owners who <br> extracted it from the capitalists. ” (Marx) 336 <br> Synthetically, Marx demonstrates that in the capitalist mode of production all social value is extracted by <br> Capitalists (in agriculture and industry) through the exploitation of workers in the city and the countryside; The <br> capitalist land income is a part of this social value that landowners extract from <br> capitalists; Thus, in capitalism, land property has the power to appropriate a portion of the <br> surplus value that was created without interference from the landowner. It is this process of extraction of part of the <br> capitalists' added value by landowners, which Marx unravels in his magnificent theory of <br> Earth income. <br> One of the theoretical challenges for the formulation of the Marxist Earth Income Theory is to maintain consistency with the <br> Fundamental postulate of scientific political economy: the law of value. This law was initially formulated by <br> classical political economy, especially by Smith and Ricardo, establishes that only human labor is <br> capable of creating new values. However, as it would be possible to explain, from this postulate, the phenomenon <br> empirical that the market value of agricultural production besides ensuring profit to the capitalist <br> Could a salary to the agricultural worker also pay an income to the landowner? If <br> according to the law of value and the law of free competition, the profits of capitalists and the salary of workers <br> tend to converge to the same average, such as explaining this surplus value of Earth's goods without <br> Make collapse the main theoretical foundation of classical political economy? The question, therefore, was <br> formulated correctly by the bourgeois classics: it is necessary to explain the land income that is up to the <br> owner of the land without using the theoretical artifice, the false explanation, that agricultural goods would be <br> sold for a price above its value. Although it has correctly formulated the conditions of the problem, <br> bourgeois political economy could not resolve it, because for this it was necessary to unravel the issue of <br> Valia; And so, only with the added value theory, which was made by the proletariat, <br> Explain capitalist land income consistently with the law of value. This great task, as <br> We know, it was up to the giant of thought and action, the founder of communism, Karl Marx. <br><br><br> In bourgeois political economy, Ricardo is the one who advances the most in solving this theoretical problem. In your <br> formulation of value theory, all the additional value created in the production process are resulting only from <br> Two factors: capital and work. However, this new value created is divided into: profit, salary and income <br> landowner. Land income in Ricardo's theory already appears correctly, as a part of the value <br> distributed only in the distribution sphere; that is, for him, the landowner has no role in the <br> production process of additional value, although it fits a part of this in the distribution of new wealth <br> produced. As Ricardo explains, then, the existence of this land income, maintaining consistently the <br> foundation that the agricultural markets even being sold for a price equal to their value <br> This extra yield to soil owners? <br> For Ricardo, the social value of goods, whether industrial or agricultural, would always be established <br> for the worst conditions of production. That is, if through competition, it is necessary that manufacturers a, <br> B, C and D produce to meet the needs of the consumer market, the value of this merchandise will be <br> Always the necessary working time consumed in the worst production condition; That is, for the longest time. <br> With this postulate, Ricardo assumes that producers whose individual values are lower than the value <br> social profit will make a supplementary profit. In industry, competition between capital tends to suppress this profit<br>additional; In agriculture, this production optimization process also occurs, but as the land is the <br> main production factor, the fertility difference between soils, will always be a limit for <br> Conditions of production are equalized with the most fertile lands. That is, a lower fertility ground, <br> will always demand more capital or more work to achieve the same productivity as a <br> greater fertility. <br> However, as for Ricardo, it is always the worst production condition that determines the social value of <br> merchandise and, in the case of agriculture the worst land, the capitalist land income could be explained by <br> Relative difference of soil fertility. Thus, in its theory of income, the social value of agricultural goods <br> It is defined by working time consumed on the worst terrain. The capitalist who produces in this worst land, <br> like all others earns the same profit rate as their competitors. However, as your <br> competitors explore more fertile land, even employing equal amount of capital and labor they <br> will obtain a larger production of goods, for example twice the amount of wheat in relation to the <br> obtained by the capitalist on the worst terrain. All wheat, both the worst and the best, are sold <br> For the same market price, which for Ricardo always the price of the worst production conditions. Being <br> Thus the capitalist of the best terrain earns twice as much as its competitor of the worst land, because <br> It sells twice as much wheat. However, it does not pocket this excess value, because what would be the excess profit <br> of the best production conditions is extracted from it by the landowner, who pockets this value as <br> Land income for giving this land to the capitalist lessee. Thus, Ricardo manages to explain the <br> existence of the landowner's income, without contradicting the foundation of the law of value, as it appears <br> even when goods are sold for a price equal to their social value. <br> The most evident logical problem of Ricardo's theory is that it assumes that the owner of the worst <br> Land would not charge lease for the use of its soil. Because if the owner of the worst land charges <br> Income, your theory is dismantled. After all, as is the value of the goods produced in the worst land that regulates the <br> market price, if the owner of this land charges an income, the market price will be: value + <br> Lease of the worst land, and so the price would be higher than the value. If there was income on the worst land <br> Capitalist land income could not be explained from the law of value. The practical problem is that the owners <br> of worst land charge leases to produce in their properties, after all as Marx says: “The <br> circumstance that the tenant can value his capital with the current profit, if he does not pay income, <br> absolutely does not induce the landowner to rent it for free to the lessee ”337. Although, Ricardo <br> advance in the explanation, could not solve the issue, because circumvent, abstract the circumstance of the income of the worst <br> Land, does not solve the problem, on the contrary, makes it difficult to resolve. <br> The merit of Ricardo's income theory, according to Marx, is that it launches the foundations of differential income, but one of <br> its main limits is that it denies the possibility of absolute income, that is, the income earned by the worst <br> ground. Ricardo could not achieve the resolution of this question by the limits in his value theory; when <br> Marx solves these limits the issue of income of the worst terrain becomes easy to solve. Marx comments <br> results of the resolution of this problem put by the classical political economy in a letter to Engels, in <br> 1862: <br><br><br> “The only thing I have to demonstrate is the possibility of absolute income, without <br> the law of value is violated. This is the central point around which the theoretical battle has been <br> physiocrats. Ricardo denies this possibility; I say it. I assert, at the same time, that its denial <br> supports a theoretically false dogma, extracted from A. Smith-this is the supposed identity <br> between cost prices and the values of goods. ” (Marx) 338 <br> With the surplus theory, Marx manages to solve the theoretically false dogma contained in the formulation of <br> Smith and Ricardo on the Law of Value. After all, with its formulation of the more-value office, from the <br> Conformation of a general profit rate, Marx demonstrates how goods are generally sold <br> by market prices other than their intrinsic values. That is, unlike Smith <br> and Ricardo the goods of the same branch of production are not always sold for a price equal to its <br> value. Marx demonstrates that value and price identify, only when all branches are considered <br> productive of a society; Only under these circumstances does the price of goods correspond exactly<br>to the value of this totality. However, in each productive branch, taken separately there is no such <br> Absolute identity between price and value. <br> This development by Marx, from the law of value taken from the classical economy, resolved a series of <br> incongruities of the continuing Smith and Ricardo, among these, the issue of land income at the worst <br> ground. In the first three books of The Capital, Marx theoretically summarizes the historical process of <br> Transformation of the value of goods into production price and from this into market price. Demonstrate <br> as the value of constant capital is reproduced in the value of the goods; and how the new value <br> Produced, product of living human labor, decomposes only in salary (variable capital) and surplus value. <br> Show in turn how this added value “transfigures” in profit and, as in the perception of the <br> Capitalist, profit is a value that exceeds the cost price. Thus details that the cost price of a goods <br> is equal to the constant capital actually spent in its production (raw material + machine wear) + <br> Variable capital (salary). And that profit is everything that exceeds this cost price. In this way, a <br> capitalist can make a profit, even selling its merchandise below its value, thus performs only <br> part of the intrinsic asset in it, being the other part of the capitalists of the other branches of <br> production. <br> Understanding, therefore, the process of sharing of surplus value is a previous condition to assimilate the theory <br> Marxist of capitalist land income. In analyzing the capitalist production process, in book I, Marx <br> abstract the effects of circulation; In this way, it considers the profit of a commodity = the added value in it <br> contained. This demonstration is key to revealing how all capital is non-paid work. At the <br> However, when studying the overall process of capitalist production, that is, considering the relationship between production and <br> Circulation, Marx shows us how this identity between profit and added value is not immediate. That is, she <br> It follows existing, all of the profit is = the totality of the surplus value produced, however, this identity is <br> mediated by the general profit rate, which divides this all of the social value among capitalists, the <br> principle, according to the magnitude of each one's capital. <br> Marx argues that if it were not so, it would come to another kind of incompatibility between the theory <br> economic and reality. After all, if the surplus value produced were identical to the appropriate added value (profit), <br> we would have to conclude that the productive branches in which there is greater mechanization, more <br> Capital constant in relation to variable capital, profit would be lower. After all, in a productive branch whose <br> proportion between constant capital and variable capital were 90C + 10V, at a 100%added value, the <br> goods would be 110. If this goods, to be sold at a market price of 110, ie, <br> In an immediate coincidence between price and value, the profit of the capitalists of this branch would be 10%. In turn, <br> a capitalist whose organic composition of its capital was distributed in the proportion of 60c + 40V, to a <br> 100%added value rate, the value of the goods would be 140. If the market price of this commodity <br> It was identical to its individual value, the earned profit would be 40%. Thus would come the absurd conclusion of <br> That profit is much larger in less mechanized branches than in the most modern industry. This would be <br> only one of the absurd results, incongruous with reality, of the errors contained in the law of value <br> as formulated by Smith and Ricardo. <br> Marx demonstrates, as already seen above, that the free competition between the capitals of the different branches of the <br> Economy, tends to conform a general profit rate in society. Thus, it is shown that profit is <br> regardless of the organic composition of capital. With the general profit rate, the already studied profit <br><br><br> medium, which is up to all capital in proportion to its magnitude. In this way, the general profit rate will <br> Social value proportionately in different productive branches. Thus, the goods produced <br> in a higher organic composition (in the example above 90C/10V) are sold for a production price that <br> It is superior to its intrinsic value. In turn, the goods produced in a lower organic composition <br> (Like 60C/40V) are sold for a lower production price than intrinsic value. <br> With this development of the law of value, the relationship between value and production price, between surplus value and <br> Average profit, Marx solves the foundations of the problem of formulating a theory of land income that <br> Do not contradict this fundamental law of scientific political economy. Thus can explain the income so much <br> Differential regarding the income of the worst land, or the absolute income. Marx shows that the<br>market price of an agricultural product, competing producers who produce in the best <br> conditions, that is, on the most fertile land, will get an individual price of production lower than the price of <br> Marketplace. This difference, this supplementary profit, which in industry would fit the capitalist, in agriculture <br> converts to land income; In the case in the differential income, which in general had already been explained by Ricardo. <br> As Marx demonstrates that the market price of agricultural goods is lower than its intrinsic value, <br> due to the organic composition below the social average, this market price may be just above the <br> Individual production price of the worst land, but still below its intrinsic value. So, by <br> more value assurance, Marx can explain the real existence of land income on the worst land without <br> counteract the law of value. Classical political economy could not resolve this issue, as it was tied to <br> dogma that the price of any and all commodities immediately corresponded to its value. Marx to <br> develop the law of value established by Smith and Ricardo, shows that the identity between price and value of <br> goods is not immediate, but, yes, mediated by the distribution of surplus value according to the composition <br> Capital Organic in the different branches of production. This is the fundamental theory base for the formulation of <br> Marxist theory of absolute income. <br> In accounting terms, only to exemplify the theory, taking the data above: in the industrial field <br> Capital is divided into 90C + 10V and in agriculture 60C + 40V. For the same rate of added value (m ') of 100%, <br> The added value (m) produced in the industry would be = 10 (m = v.m ’= 10 x 100% = 10), while the added value produced in <br> Agriculture would be = 40 (40 x 100% = 40). The value produced in the industry (c + v + m) would be = 90c + 10v + 10m = <br> 110; The value produced in agriculture would be = 60c + 40c + 40m = 140. The total value produced would be = 10m <br> + 40m = 50m. As the added value is not immediately realized by productive branches, but is shared between <br> these branches, all social value, in this example, 25m for industry and 25m for the <br> agriculture. Thus, all the capital of 100, regardless of its organic composition and the surplus value <br> immediately extracted by it, earns a profit of 25. The average profit rate in society would therefore be <br> 25%. <br> The capitalist land income, however, constitutes the particular branch of surplus value. The Owners <br> Lands in the capitalist mode of production earn this part of the social value without participating in the process <br> productive neither with capital nor with work. Taking the example above, part of the 50m, is appropriate by the <br> landowners, for example, 10m, thus reducing the assault of the capitalists of the <br> Industry and agriculture at 40m, and the average profit rate from 25% to 20%. The particular condition that ensures <br> This power to landowners is that the main economic factors of the branches of agriculture and <br> Extractive industry are made up of monopoly natural forces. The exercise of this monopoly <br> propitious landowners the collection of an income for its use. The higher the income <br> lower land will be the average profit rate of a particular company. <br> In order to further understand this particular form of distribution of surplus value, let us now take the branch of <br> separate agriculture to understand the Marxist theory of differential income and absolute income. <br> Let us start with differential income. Suppose two competing capitalists, applying the same amount <br> capital in the same planting area with land of different qualities. Both develop 100 from <br> Capital, divided into 60c + 40V; the capitalist of the land A, produces with this capital of 100 an amount of <br> 60 kg of wheat, while the capitalist of land B, with the same magnitude of capital produces 120 kg of wheat. O <br> Cost price of the two capitalists is the same = 100 (60 with consisting capital and 40 with salary); The difference is <br> that the capitalist on the best land produces 120 kg of wheat, while the capitalist of the worst land produces <br> only 60 kg. However, as seen, in capitalist agriculture is the production price of the worst land that <br><br><br> determines the market price. The production price of the worst land, according to the formula established by <br> Marx would be = cost price + average profit = (60c + 40v) + 25m = 125. Thus, all 60 kg wheat bag <br> regardless of whether it has been produced in the best or the worst land will be sold at 125. <br> worst terrain, selling its 60 kg bag of wheat to 125, earns the average profit from 25, and is satisfied with this <br> result because it ensures the average profit rate in a given society; Although I wouldn't be paying the <br> lease to the owner of the worst land, question will clarify later when dealing with income <br> Absolute.<br>In the Boundar B, of superior fertility, the economic results would be distinct. In this soil, the capitalist with <br> The same investment of capital and labor (60c + 40v) obtains120 kg of wheat. Its cost price for <br> each bag of wheat (60 kg) would be = 100: 2 = 50. However, as the market price is established by <br> Production price of the worst land he would sell each bag at 125 and would pocket 250 for the two bags sold. <br> With a capital invested 100, it would make a total profit of 150. What is the reason for this supplementary profit? No <br> was no new method of exploitation of agriculture or greater exploitation of its workers <br> (We are assuming the same value rate for both of you). The reason for this difference was that a greater <br> natural soil fertility allowed it, with the same spending of capital and labor, to produce twice as much <br> to the worst terrain. <br> However, this naturally high fertility is a natural force monopolized by the owner <br> the best land B, which charges a lease of the capitalist for the use of his land, for example, of <br> 125. Thus, the total profit obtained by selling the two bags of wheat produced by capitalist B is <br> Discounted the land income paid to the owner of this land, ie 150 - 125 = 25. Assim, the capitalist <br> that produces on the ground B receives exactly the same profit as the capitalist who produces in the worst land, which is <br> The same profit made in the industry, according to our example. <br> The lease or this land income earned by the owner of the best land constitutes the income <br> differential. For Marx, therefore, differential income is equal to the difference between the production price <br> Individual and the market price that is the production price of the worst land. <br> But what about absolute income? <br> As we know, the owner of the worst land will also charge a price for the lease. Marx no <br> It circumvents this practical problem as Ricardo does in his theory. For Marx, according to the example above, the <br> lease of the worst land could reach the value of 15 and yet the law of <br> value. Let's see: being the production price of the worst land of (60c + 40v) + 25m, if the lease is 15 <br> The market price will be = 125 + 15 = 140. In this case there would be the income of the worst land and the price of the product <br> Agricultural would not be above its intrinsic value (140). Marx can do so, prove the existence of income <br> Land of the worst terrain without violating the law of value. For the capitalist who produces on the worst ground <br> Pay the income in the amount of 15 to the owner of A, the market price has to rise from 125 to 140. This <br> raising the market price also favors the owner of land B, who starts to charge a <br> Lease of 125 + 15. Therefore, the land income of the worst land is an absolute income, as it is earned <br> by all landowners in capitalist agriculture, while differential income is relative, because <br> It varies according to the relative fertility of land. The owner of the worst land receives only the income <br> Absolute, the owners of the most fertile land receive differential income + absolute income. <br> From the point of view of the economy, agricultural goods then constitute an exception: they are the only <br> whose market price is higher than production price. This is a kind of monopoly of this <br> branches of the economy. But as Marx highlights this is not a “proper monopoly”, how would <br> If you sell inferior organic composition goods for a market price greater than its value. <br> Marx's land income theory can thus explain the income of all landowners, <br> More fertile land and worst land, without violating the law of value or the law of free competition. <br> For Marx, the fact that the goods produced in the branches of superior organic composition are sold by <br> a price greater than its intrinsic value, that is, because they appropriate part of the added value produced in the <br> Other branches does not constitute a contract. After all, as Marx demonstrates it, these branches demand greater <br> accumulation and capital concentration and, therefore, dominate the whole economy. Upon receiving their <br> Quinhão da Mais-Valia, through the general profit rate, therefore receive the part that fits them in the production <br><br><br> capitalist. However, it would be a deck if the capitalists of the branches of lower organic composition, in <br> general agriculture and extractive industry, they would sell their goods for a market price above <br> of its intrinsic value. If that happened, it would imply that agriculture would be dominating the industry, being <br> that in practice what happens is the opposite in capitalism. <br> As we have seen, the monopoly price itself is one of the characteristics of the imperialist step. <br> We have seen that Lenin points out precisely this in the example of portalized sugar production in the USA. In this<br>If the agricultural product is sold for a market price greater than its value; The difference between this price <br> market and this value is a form of particular income of imperialism, which is different from income <br> Absolute studied by Marx. In Lenin's example, it is not a bustling domain of the producers of the <br> sugar over the Yankee economy, but from the domain of financial capital over society that by imposing this <br> monopoly price itself, extracts from society part of the social tax that conforms to its profit <br> maximum. <br> In Marx's formulation, different issues are contained that need reflection for their assimilation and <br> correct application in the studies of concrete cases. Marx in its formulation of differential income and <br> absolute, although developing Ricardo in many respects, maintains his correct postulates about production <br> capitalist in agriculture, namely: 1) the same amount of capital and labor employed in soils <br> different from the same land area produce different results; 2) The capitalists who apply this capital <br> Require to reach the general profit rate of society; 3) The production price of the worst land is the price <br> Market regulator. That is, the differential income for Marx is not “born” as the direction of UOC (MLM) believes <br> only the fertility difference of the terrain; It also depends on the average profit reached by the tenants <br> on all land and to such that the market price is established for the production price of the worst <br> ground. Therefore, Marx says that the production price of the worst soil “is the basis of differential income” 339. For <br> to assimilate Marx's theory, therefore, it is necessary to understand the question of why the production price <br> of the worst land determines the market price in the pure form of capitalist RUDIARY income. <br> As seen, for Ricardo are always the worst production conditions that determine the social value of <br> Goods and, for him, there is an immediate identity between price and value of a particular product. Marx, already <br> in the book I of The Capital, demonstrates that the average conditions are responsible for establishing the time of <br> socially necessary work for the production of a commodity. For Marx, this law is valid for both <br> industrial production as for agricultural production, however in the latter there is a specific functioning <br> of this law, which constitutes a very important particular trait in the Marxist theory of income. <br> The same competition that exists in the industry, among manufacturers of the same product, exists in agriculture <br> capitalist. All capitalist wheat producers, for example, compete with each other and seek to reduce by <br> maximum cost prices of your product, reducing the value of the constant capital employed (seeds and <br> tractors, for example) is increasing the exploitation of their workers as much as possible. Some capitalist who <br> can reduce wheat production costs from a new planting method, for example, <br> You will get the individual value of your product to be lower than the average social value of all producers. <br> It will thus earn supplementary profit as it occurs in the industry. As already seen, the competition pushes all <br> capitalist producers to use the most rational production methods and increase exploration, that <br> leads to an equalization of socially necessary working time, individual values tend to <br> converge to the same value, the supplementary profit thus tends to disappear, and the goods to become <br> cheapest. <br> However, in agriculture and the extractive industry there is a particularity that prevents to some extent <br> This equalization of individual values and the tendency of supplementary profit suppression. Is that in agriculture <br> Earth is the main element of production and in the extractive industry the main reserve of use values. One <br> new method of production or a new form of intensification of work, can all be widespread and <br> be used by competing capitalists. However, a source of oil in the soil is not a <br> universalizable production condition. The private property of this source necessarily excludes other <br> competitors to explore it. Thus, the capitalist who explores this source will have much lower production costs <br> than the one who explores the worst ground, such as sources of oil embedded in underground rocks. It is <br> Differential soil fertility cannot be universalized, it constitutes a natural force <br> monopolizable and monopolized by a land owner. In the capitalist mode of production, as we have seen, <br><br><br> The monopolization of these natural forces enables landowners to extract part of the asset <br> that would fit the capitalists. <br> These two conditions: monopoly natural force and the need for average profit, determine that in <br> agriculture and the extractive industry, unlike the manufacturing industry, will be the production price of the<br>Worst ground that will determine the market price. Following the example seen above, from two capitalists who <br> produce in land A (worst fertility) and B (greater fertility); capitalist a, will only plant wheat in a <br> earn the average profit; The landowner of B, will only lease his land to pocket as income <br> Land, in the case of differential income, the supplementary profit that the natural forces of its land provides; O <br> soil owner A, in turn will be content with an absolute income, which should be a maximum of <br> difference between the production price of this worst land and the intrinsic value of this merchandise. These are the <br> basic conditions of capitalist production in agriculture: all owners require an income from <br> exploration of their lands, lace that vary with value according to the economic fertility of the land; It is <br> All tenants require average profit. <br> In this way, as Marx demonstrates, so that the worst land is explored it is necessary that the price <br> Wheat market, for example, rise to the point where the capitalist lesser who cultivates there <br> The average profit, and the owner of this land receives an income, however minimal. Therefore, under the conditions <br> pure capitalists, in agriculture and the extractive industry will always be the production price of the worst land <br> Market regulator. However, this regulation for the worst land does not only imply the appreciation <br> surplus of absolute income, it also implies an artificial appreciation of the most <br> fertile. This is what Marx calls "false social value." Let's see: <br> “Regarding the differential income, it should be noted that the market value is always above price <br> global production production produced. Take for example Table I. The global product of 10 <br> Quarters is sold by 600 xelins, because the production price of A, 60 xelins per quarter, <br> determines the market price. But the real price of production is: <br> TERRENOSQUARTS PRODUCTION <br> by terrain as a realrerection of <br> Production by quarter <br> A1 = 60 1 = 60 <br> B2 = 60 1 = 30 <br> C3 = 60 1 = 20 <br> D4 = 60 1 = 15 <br> Total10 = 240Medy1 = 24 <br> The actual price of 10 quarters production is 240 xelins; They are sold for 600, 250% more expensive. O <br> Real 1 quarter average price is 24 xelins; The market price of 60 xelins, also 250% more expensive. AND <br> determination by market value, as imposed on the capitalist production system through <br> of competition, which generates false social value. The phenomenon stems from the market of market value, to which <br> Soil products are subject. The determination of the market value of the products, including the <br> soil products therefore, it is a social act, although its social achievement is neither conscious nor <br> intentional and is necessarily based on the product value of the product, not on the ground and <br> the differences in your fertility. ” (Marx) 340 <br> That is, production on the four land (A, B, C and D), cultivated by different capitalist tenants, <br> corresponds to a total of 10 wheat quarters. The production price of the worst land is 60 xelins each <br> quarter, being the cost price (constant capital + variable capital) = at 50 xelins and the average profit of 10 <br> Xelins, corresponding to a general profit rate of 20%. If the market price is not 60 xelins the quarter, <br> the capitalist who produces in A, will not earn the average profit, much less it will be possible to pay the income of the worst <br> ground. So there will only be 10 quarters available on the market if the market price reaches this level. At the <br> However, the greater the difference in fertility between the more fertile ground and the worst regulatory terrain <br> Market, the higher the differential income earned by the most fertile land. This phenomenon, governed by the “law <br> market value ”which is subject to soil production implies that society has to pay a <br> much higher market price than the actual average production price of each wheat quarter. Under these conditions <br> the company pays 60 xelins for each quarter of wheat, while the real average of production prices of each <br> Quarter is only 24 xelins. This difference, as Marx indicates, from 600 to 240 xelins, by 10 quarters of <br><br><br> wheat, that is, this value of 360 Xelins is the surplus value that society pays to landowners in <br> differential income condition. This value, as Marx points out, is not “born” the difference in soil fertility, <br> but is based on the law that regulates the value of exchange of soil production; which determines that the worst land regulates the <br> market price. <br> This irrational market of market prices of soil production is a reflection of the irrationality of <br> Private soil property in capitalist mode of production. The property of a means of production that does not <br> It is the product of work, enables its owner to appropriate part of the social value without participating <br> in nothing of the production process. Private property of the earth and the need for average profit imply that the<br>society, as in the example above, pay more for each quarter of wheat and support the parasitic class <br> of the great landowners. As Marx analyzes this situation is not inherent in agricultural production, but <br> of its capitalist exploitation: <br> “If we imagine abolished the capitalist form of society, and society converted into association <br> conscious and planned, the 10 quarters would represent, of autonomous working time, the same <br> to the contained 240 Xelins. The company would not pay for this agricultural product 2.5 times the time of <br> work that is inserted in it; would disappear the basis of a class of landowners. (...) A <br> identity of the market price of goods of the same species is the way the character is imposed <br> value of value on the basis of capitalist production and, in general, in the production based on the exchange of <br> goods between individuals. What society, in the role of consumer, pays too much for products <br> agricultural, which for it represents negative amount in the realization of its working time in the <br> agricultural production, then constitutes the surplus of part of society: the owners of <br> lands. ” (Marx) 341 <br> Large landowners and capitalist production lead to irrational phenomena in production <br> Agricultural, as the false social value. This situation, in turn, that to some extent contradicts fundamentals <br> basic of the capitalist mode of production, it is due in part to the fact highlighted by Marx about the content <br> history of land property: <br> “From the point of view of capitalist production, the property of capital is actually revealed the first because it is <br> the species of ownership on which the capitalist production is based on where it is a factor and exercises function, which <br> It is not valid for land property. This patents derived because in reality the modern <br> land property is the feudal transformed by the action of capital, therefore the form <br> Modern derivative, results from capitalist production. ” (Marx) 342 <br> The nationalization of the earth, therefore, as Marx and Lenin clarifies, is an attempt by the bourgeoisie of <br> return against this feudal irrationality from which its modern form derives. As Marx points out: <br> “The right one is reduced to this: supposedly the capitalist mode of production, the capitalist is not just an employee <br> Unprensible of production, but the predominant employee. The owner of the land, on the other hand, is at all <br> superfluous in the capitalist mode of production. This mode of production only needs that the earth does not <br> common property, opposes the working class as a production condition that does not <br> belongs to this class, and this goal is completely achieved when the earth becomes the property of the <br> State, that is, the state perceives land income. The landowner, such an essential employee of the <br> Production in the ancient and medieval world, it is in the useless industrial age, excrescence. The radical bourgeois <br> (also coveting the suppression of all other taxes) advances in the theoretical plan to deny the <br> private property of the land, which would wish to make the common property of the bourgeois class, capital, <br> in the form of state ownership. In practice, however, the attack on a form of <br> property - a form of private property of working conditions - would be very dangerous for <br> the other way. In addition, the bourgeois himself became the owner of land. ” (Marx) 343 <br> If the bourgeoisie is lacking the courage to deny the private property of the land in imperialist countries, this is not <br> It implies that it is prevented from denying it, for its benefit, in the semicolonial and colonial countries. In this way, <br> The imperialist bourgeoisie supplies land income in the oppressed countries, or appropriates it as they are <br> the conditions. After all it would be unthinkable that financial capital will be willing to pay this false social value to <br> large landowners of the semicolonial countries, or who was willing to pay the tax that <br> represents absolute income, as a market price above the production price of the worst land, to <br> landowners of the oppressed nations. In the same way it would be unthinkable to conclude that the great bourgeoisie of <br><br><br> semicolonial countries, was willing to pay the average profit and in addition to a supplementary profit to <br> peasants small owners. <br> It is of general knowledge that the reality of the exploitation of the mineral riches of the semicolonial countries, that the <br> export of agricultural goods of these nations and that peasant production does not generate the payment of a <br> supplementary profit to these nations or these peasant masses. This seems to contradict the Marxist theory of <br> Capitalist land income, but there is no such incongruity. Marx fully solved the problem of laws <br> of the capitalist income of the land; What happens, therefore, is not a violation of the law, but the explanation that the <br> manifestation of these laws in mineral and agricultural production and peasant production, is different from<br>Its pure or classic form of land income in England in the nineteenth century. Understand the <br> Capitalist land income theory is key to seeing how the domain of financial capital imposes forms <br> of non -capitalist income to the oppressed nations and the peasant masses of these countries. Understanding this theory is <br> basis for understanding international meaning in the imperialist phase of the evolution of the forms of relations <br> semi -feudal production. Without this understanding it is impossible to analyze precisely the relationship between <br> Fundamental contradictions in the world today, as well as identify which one is the main contradiction. And the <br> Marx himself the forerunner of what the direction of UOC (MLM) calls semi -feudality theory. Because it is the <br> founder of communism who offers us with the demonstration that peasant production and production <br> Semicolonial do not provide capitalist land income. A misunderstanding of the Marxist theory of <br> Land income can only lead to absurd conclusions such as that of the existence of a “landing peasant <br> capitalist ”, and never clarifying current phenomena and the functioning of land income in imperialism. <br> 2.2- Marx's analysis of the land income of peasants in general and the large owners <br> semicolonial countries <br> Before we advance to the analysis of the operation of land income at the time of imperialism, <br> necessary to resume Marx's studies on the land income of the peasants and the large <br> Land production in semicolonial countries in the stage of free competition capitalism. Marx does not reach <br> formulate a complete theory on feudal, semi -feudal land income or the operation of this <br> Semicolonial production already submitted to the capitalist world market. However, it points out that these <br> modalities do not conform capitalist forms of land income and, in doing so, in a genial way <br> the theoretical fundamentals that allow us to further understand the development of <br> production in the field and the exploration relations of imperialism in relation to the oppressed nations. <br> Everyone who knows the living conditions of the peasant masses in the colonial countries and <br> semicolonials realize that the economic relationship of these masses with the capitalist market <br> those principles of capitalist land income established by Marx. Are components owners of <br> small or medium installments of land, whether “re -lender” peasants of the latifundes, would be <br> difficult to conclude that these “rural producers” receive the average profit, which would fit them as capitalists, or the <br> supplementary profit (differential income) as owners of more fertile land, or who could impose a <br> market price higher than their production price (absolute income) if they owned the worst <br> land. As already mentioned above, Marx shows that the poor peasants, even the owners of their <br> Lands, as a rule, do not receive the average profit, differential income or absolute income; in most <br> times the results of your production cover only the value corresponds to the salary they would receive for a <br> equal work and in many cases do not even earn this value. <br> We know that in general, the peasants who own land are on the worst land. If the laws of <br> Capitalist land income pure the peasant economy, what would be the result? The price <br> production (which includes the average profit) of the peasants would regulate the market price, in addition <br> It would be just above this amount to provide absolute income to these small owners. <br> Everyone who knows the history and field of semicolonial countries minimally know that this is not <br> situation that prevails. As a rule, the market price is always below the production price of <br> Peasants, that when they let them sell all their production they can barely cover the necessary costs. It is <br> Condition imposes exactly the ruined economy situation, in which peasant masses live. To the <br> forms of manipulation of this market price are several, either through the commercialization in which the <br> peasants find themselves forced to sell their production at very low prices because they are unable to <br> drain it, either by competition with the production of the large property which it can produce with <br> much lower costs. Any of these or other forms converges to the same result: the <br><br><br> Poor peasant does not receive the average profit, does not receive differential income or absolute income. In this way, <br> It is not difficult to realize that in semicolonial economies, it is not the production price of the worst terrain (in general <br> owned or leased by the poor peasants) that regulates the market price. There is a lack of a condition <br> indispensable for the existence of capitalist land income; the property of the peasant land, therefore,<br>implies production relations other than the capitalists. Lenin points out as follows the conclusion of <br> Marx that peasants do not earn absolute income: <br> “The existence of the small agrarian property or, rather said, of the small farm introduces, <br> naturally, certain changes in the general theses of theory on capitalist income, but not <br> Destroys this theory. Marx points out, for example, that absolute income as such <br> ordinary in the small cultivation, mainly intended to satisfy the need of <br> Farmer (...). But the more the mercantile economy develops, the more applicable all the <br> theses of economic theory equally to the peasant farm, since it placed itself within the <br> conditions of the capitalist world. ” (Lenin) 344 <br> This passage is very important, because in it Lenin emphasizes precisely the changes in the general theses of <br> theory on land income that it is essential to be studied by communist parties, especially <br> semicolonial countries. Very important also the reschedule that for Marx there is no general income <br> absolute to the peasants. Regarding Lenin's statement about the validity of these laws in developing the <br> Mercantile economy, it is correct as a general trend of the free competition stage. But in the course of <br> capitalist development in the twentieth century, this trend changes, as we enter the time of capital <br> monopolist. In the imperialist stage, the peasant economy always subsists by capital <br> monopolist and, therefore, it is impossible for peasants to impose on the bourgeoisie, imperialism, the city <br> generally, a monopoly price about their production that would assure them at least the income <br> absolute of the worst terrain. To survive as peasants, this mass is forced to accept only one <br> income corresponding to the salary for equal work, sometimes a little more, most of the time a <br> Little less. About the peasant economy at the time of imperialism, President Mao highlights the following <br> question: <br> “To serve the needs of its aggression, imperialism ruined the Chinese peasantry, <br> exploring it through the exchange of unequal values; In this way, it created immense masses of <br> poor peasants, which totaled hundreds of millions and represented 80% of the rural population of the <br> country." (President Mao) 345 <br> President Mao, emphasizing the “exchange of unequal values” imposed by imperialism to <br> Chinese peasantry, is highlighting just one of the most common forms of financial capital to <br> control market price at the time of imperialism. In this way, it imposes on the peasants a price of <br> monopoly itself (ie, in which the market price of industrialized goods beyond <br> On the way their value also passes the average profit that would be up to these goods). So, the <br> tools, machines, fertilizers, pesticides, etc., are sold to peasants at prices of <br> monopolies, raising the cost of production of the small property, preventing it from earning the average profit, <br> differential income or absolute income. As President Mao points out, at the time of imperialism <br> confirmed the trend of the free competition stage that the laws of capitalist land income would go <br> peasant economy as it became mercantile. The more mercantile the economy became <br> Peasant in the semicolonial countries, but it became ruined. The difficult thing is not to see this situation, the difficult, <br> theoretically speaking, it is to realize why the reproduction of this ruined economy becomes necessary to capital <br> Monopolist, question that we will seek to clarify the front. <br> Let's look at Marx's analysis of why peasant property, under normal circumstances, <br> does not earn absolute income in capitalism (in the stage of free competition): <br> “Precisely in this form of ownership it should generally admit that there is no absolute income, <br> that the worst land does not pay income, because absolute income assumes that, besides the production price, <br> perform an surplus of the value of the product, or that a monopoly price exceeds the value of the <br> product. But since agriculture is largely intended for immediate subsistence and land <br> It is indispensable field of work and capital activity, for the majority of the population, the price <br> Product Market Regulator will only reach the value of it under exceptional circumstances. ” <br> (Marx) 346 <br><br><br> As we saw above, Marx, developing and rectifying the failures of Ricardo's income theory, demonstrates <br> that the existence of capitalist land income on the worst land may exist without violating the law of value. Because as the <br> agriculture is a branch of production in which an organic composition lower than the social average prevails, the price <br> Market of these goods is sold below their value, but with an average profit. Marx demonstrates<br>then, that absolute income represents, in its maximum, this difference between the market price and the value <br> Instructing of the goods. In the passage above, he is saying that the market price of production <br> Peasant can only reach the intrinsic value in exceptional circumstances; That is, the peasantry only earns <br> absolute income in situations of demand much higher than supply, for example, when scarcity <br> excessive of certain goods. Under normal circumstances, Marx says there is no income <br> absolute for the peasantry. <br> Marx demonstrated in his theory of land income that the worst land is only explored in a way <br> capitalist, if the production price of this regulates the market price. In this way, if there is search above the <br> wheat offer, for example, and all the best quality land are producing its maximum, a <br> capitalist will only expand production to the worst land if the market price rises enough for it <br> earn the average profit and, in addition, climb enough for him to pay the lease to the owner of the worst <br> ground. This requirement, Marx highlights it, does not exist for peasant production: <br> “The average profit of capital does not limit the exploration of the small property, while the peasant <br> He is a small capitalist; nor does it limited the need for an income, while it owns <br> from the earth. Although small capitalist, the only absolute limit for him is the salary that pays <br> Even after deducting the costs themselves. While the price of the product will cover it, it will cultivate the <br> Earth, and frequently submitting to reduced salary to the minimum vital. ” (Marx) 347 <br> While the market price cover the salary that the peasant pays to himself, he will produce to <br> market. That is, unlike capitalist production, the peasant cultivates on the worst terrain even though <br> Do not earn profit, even if you do not receive income if you are the owner of this soil. This is important to fix the <br> Following Conclusion: Even in the free competition stage, the peasant cost price does not regulate the price <br> market; who regulates the market price, ultimately, are the worst land cultivated by <br> large -scale production. Therefore, when the peasantry competes with the products of large production it <br> is obliged to sell its goods for the market price established by it, that is, for a price of <br> market that makes it impossible to earn a satisfactory yield. As President Mao demonstrates, this <br> Market regulation is even more unthinkable in the imperialist step. Both absolute income and <br> possibility of imposing a monopoly price itself of agricultural goods (as in <br> Lenin's example about the price of sugar in the USA in the early twentieth century), are not possible, generally to <br> The peasant economy, as Marx points out, these: <br> “[Absolute income and monopoly price are two cases that] hardly occur in the economy <br> parcel and in the small land property, because precisely then the production, for the most part, <br> It satisfies its own consumption, effective without depending on the regulatory role of the general profit rate. <br> Even when the parcel exploration takes place on leased land, the lease money, well <br> More than in any other conditions, it covers part of the profit and even absorbs part of the salary; <br> The income there is only nominal, not constituting autonomous category in the face of salary and profit. ” <br> (Marx) 348 <br> It seems quite clear to us that for Marx, the peasant performance obtained in the small agricultural exploration <br> constitutes capitalist land income. Let's see now how he analyzes the income of the great exploration <br> agricultural in semicolonies focused on exports in the world market: <br> “It is wrong to suppose that because they have colonies and young countries in general, the possibility of exporting wheat to <br> Cheaper prices, their land necessarily has greater fertility. The cereals there are sold <br> below the value, below the production price, that is, below the production price determined in the <br> Old countries by the average profit rate. ” (Marx) 349 <br> Marx is saying that the price of wheat exported by the colonies is not low because they are their lands <br> fertile, but because they are sold below the production price determined by the average profit rate of <br> Metropolises. The economic meaning of this conclusion of Marx is this: if the low price of the colonies wheat <br> if it should be the largest soil fertility, this would mean that with the same amount of capital and labor, <br><br><br> In the same area of terrain, in the colonies would be obtained more wheat than in the metropolis; these <br> conditions, as already seen, would allow a supplementary profit to the colonial wheat in relation to the wheat <br> Metropolis, which could be converted into differential income from the earth; If under these conditions the colonial wheat were <br> sold for a lower price, would only stop making the differential income, but<br>also providing medium profit and absolute income. However, the situation is even more acute; Marx Show <br> that colonial wheat is not just receiving a hypothetical differential income, because as it is produced <br> on worse land and sells below the production price of the metropolis wheat, similar to <br> Peasant production Colonial production does not earn differential income, absolute income not even profit <br> medium in its entirety. <br> There is a coincidence with peasant land income, but in this there is also a huge <br> difference. Because, while peasant performance supplied at best what would be the salary by a <br> Even work, the yield of the agro -export landowner can be huge. The conditions that determine <br> This enormous yield is thus highlighted by Marx when analyzing colonial production: <br> “(…) All surplus production [of the colony] is configured in wheat. It is what distinguishes beforehand <br> colonial states based on the modern world market, of those who existed before, especially <br> those of antiquity. Receive from the world market finished products that in other circumstances they <br> they would have to produce: clothing, work instruments, etc. Only on this basis could the states of <br> South of the union make cotton its main product. The division of labor in the market <br> International allows them such a thing. If, therefore, despite the recent existence and the population <br> relatively scarce, they have very large surplus product, this occurrence is not due to the <br> fertility of the earth, nor the fertility of work, but to the unilateral form of this and by <br> Out of the surplus product in which it materializes. ” (Marx) 350 <br> That is, colonization based on the capitalist world market, the international division of labor, allows <br> that all surplus production (for commercialization) is configured in wheat. The gigantic volume of this <br> surplus should neither fertility of the soil, nor the productivity of work, but to the unilaterality of the <br> production. Thus, this gigantic volume of wheat, Marx was analyzing in this case the production in the north of the <br> USA, can be sold below the production price of the metropolis and still receive a sumptuous profit. This is <br> a huge difference from peasant production that is permanently ruined by <br> large property. However, in both, peasant production in general and the great production for <br> Export, analyzed by Marx, receive neither the capitalist land income nor the typical average profit <br> of this mode of production. <br> This condition of colonial production and peasant production, that is, of not retaining all or even <br> any part of the supplementary profit that configures the capitalist land income, was already the object of struggle <br> important between the English industrial bourgeoisie and the land aristocracy. After all, as we have seen, the land income <br> Capitalist is a branch of social value that landowners extract from capitalists; It is <br> Of course the industry reacts against this extraction and seeks to reduce land rents to the fullest. In this <br> peasant and colonial production, especially the latter, fulfilled an important role in the course of the century <br> XIX. Because as Marx analyzes, when there is importation of colonial wheat, especially without taxes, as <br> This is sold for a price below the production price is the one who regulates the market price. <br> Thus, by falling the market price, the differential income of the best metropolitan lands is reduced. <br> By reducing this market price thanks to the importation of the colonial wheat that does not earn or income <br> capitalist or average profit, the value of the workforce is decreased, because as much of this is <br> consisting of food costs. The reduction of the value of the workforce is accompanied by <br> Reduction of proletariat's salary and consequently increased value rate. Thus, the wheat <br> colonial, still at the time of free competition it already corresponded to the important factor to increase the rate of <br> added value and the profit rate. As Marx points out: <br> “When the value of the workforce rises, as it rises the value of the necessary subsistence means to <br> reproduce it, or when it descends, by descending the value of these subsistence means (…) to the high <br> corresponds to the decrease of added value and, at low, increased added value (…). ” (Marx) 351 <br> Engels, in an important added to the book III of The Capital, then explains to us as if the production <br> agricultural (large and small), contributes to counteract the growth tendency of land income in <br><br><br> virtue of the occupation of increasing quantities of land of the globe and investments <br> successive capital in the same portion of land (type II differential income): <br> “The more capital applies to the soil, the more they develop in a country the agriculture and <br> civilization in general, the more they go up the lace for Acre and the total revenues, the more<br>gigantic is the tribute that with the supplementary profit. <br> landowners, provided that all types of land have been cultivated <br> continue to compete. This law explains the astonishing vitality of the class of the great owners of <br> lands. (…) The same law, however, explains why this vitality of the great owners of <br> Lands run out gradually. When abolished in England, in 1846, customs rights <br> on cereals, the manufacturers thought that the territorial aristocracy, with this measure, would be reduced to <br> indigence. Instead they got even richer. And it's easy to explain that. (…) Having not been <br> the worst soils, at most, used in other purposes, on a basis only provisional in <br> Rule, the incomes rose in proportion to the addition of the capital employed, and the situation of the aristocracy <br> Territorial got even better. <br> But everything is fleeting. Transoceanic ships and northern and south American railways <br> They allowed strange regions to compete in the European wheat markets. There were the <br> American prairies, Argentine pampas, plains, by nature ready to be plowed, earth <br> virgin that provided abundant yields years even with a primitive method of culture <br> No fertilizers. There were also the lands of the Russian and Indian peasant communities, forced to <br> Sell increasing part of the respective product, in order to obtain money for the products that the <br> Cruel despotism of the state extorts them, often employing torture. The peasant <br> sold these products without considering the cost of production, for the price that offered him the <br> trader, as it had an absolute need for money to pay taxes on time. In <br> face of this competition, that of the virgin land of the plains or that of the Russian and Indian peasant <br> By taxes, they could not mediate, on the basis of the old incomes, the lease and the European peasants. <br> Part of the land in Europe was definitely expelled from competition for wheat plantation, the <br> Laces fell everywhere (…) and so extended from Scotland to Italy and southern France to Prussia <br> Oriental the agrarian calamity. ” (Engels) 352 <br> In this passage, Engels makes a very important analysis of the economic role of agricultural production in <br> Colonies for industrial production and agriculture in nineteenth -century industrialized Europe. A <br> unilaterality of large colonial production, allows landlords to export their goods with <br> High yield but without earning capitalist land income. The poverty of the peasants in the colonies <br> It forces them to sell their goods for a market price that does not cover the costs of two production. <br> The end of the import taxes of agricultural goods, in 1846, in England, increased entry <br> of these agricultural products whose market price did not pay a high capitalist land income. O <br> immediate result of this measure was the reduction of capitalist land income of the English aristocracy, in the <br> that the market price of these products fell, and, in turn, provided a substantial elevation of the <br> valued extracted by English industrialists. Capitalist land income does not pay colonial producers <br> allowed the relegation of food market prices, so the salary reduction and the increase in <br> Valiated and capitalist profit. This exploration relationship of oppressed nations and peasants, already identified <br> By Marx and Engels, far from being eliminated worsened in the monopolistic phase of capitalism. <br> There is no doubt, therefore, that peasant and colonial production for export, that is, the monoculture for the <br> world market, so characteristic of Latin American economic and social formations, according to the analysis <br> Marx, they do not constitute forms of capitalist income. What kind of income are these? Marx's studies on <br> Genesis of capitalist land income help us clarify this very important question. In this session of <br> Book III of The Capital, Marx shows that land income, as well as capital, is a social relationship, which <br> every social relationship is based on a production relationship and that in the class society every relationship of <br> Production is a relationship of exploration, extraction of excess work. Marx concludes, therefore, that the <br> characterization of the type of land income earned is the key to the characterization of production relations <br> predominant. Shows, for example, that for an autonomous producer, who is possessing the means of <br> production and working conditions, giving part of the result of its production to an exploiting agent, this <br> assignment can only occur through “extraeconomic coercion”: <br> “According to the assumptions, the direct producer holds his own means of production, the conditions <br> work objectives required for the accomplishment of their work and the production of their means of<br>subsistence; It exerts agriculture autonomously, as well as the homemade rural industry <br><br><br> linked to her. (...) Under such conditions, the more work can only be extracted from them by the owner <br> nominal of the earth through extraeconomic coercion, whatever the way this is <br> Present. ” (Marx) 353 <br> As Marx's analysis demonstrates, the semmicolonian agro -export landowners and the peasants <br> provide their goods without earning medium profit and capitalist land income, the former with large <br> yields the seconds in permanent ruin. These agricultural goods without capitalist land income, <br> in turn, they result in greater value production, at a higher profit rate for capitalists, in <br> measure that provide conditions to reduce workers' wages of these countries. The income <br> negative of this agricultural and peasant production is carried out as an asset to capitalists, mainly <br> For imperialist financial capital, according to its office. Even if they are legal owners and <br> fact of its lands, the agro -export landowner and the peasant do not perform economically, <br> Integral, their property, that is, cannot transform this property into the power to extract the added value <br> From the bourgeoisie, which characterizes the capitalist land income. After all, as Marx points out: “(...) to appropriate <br> of income is the economic form in which land property takes place ”354. However, who performs <br> Economically the property of the semicolonial landlord and the peasantry, in general, is the great bourgeoisie <br> industrial, ultimately and in greater proportion to imperialist financial capital, as it transforms this <br> Negative land income in increased added value. <br> Between the metropolis and the colony/semicolonia there is a relationship of domination for the first and dependence on <br> second, finally, of vassalage, which by different (economic, political and military) means <br> landowners to deliver their goods below the production price. The unilaterality of monoculture <br> for export, it makes these formations doubly dependent: they need the <br> metropolises to obtain manufactured goods, they need metropolises to flow their production, <br> They need metropolis by capital to invest. What happens at the local level with the peasants, repeats <br> worldwide with agro -exported semicolonial landlord. The city explores the field in general and <br> Industry Agriculture in particular, and the metropolis exploited the colonies/semicolonies. The great <br> landlords, therefore, are like vassals of the metropolitan bourgeoisie, aligned politics and ideological <br> with the ideas, customs and culture of the metropolis. <br> All these trends that are still present in the nineteenth century, develop fully in the stage <br> imperialist. Land income of agro -export landlord is therefore an evolved form of income <br> Feudal land that, even based on the exploitation of wage labor, does not provide an income <br> capitalist land. It is therefore a semi -feudal income. The land income of the peasant is also not <br> capitalist, even if he is the legal owner and in fact his land lot, it is not the one who performs <br> economically this property. Its ruined production makes capitalist profits grow, despite the low <br> productivity. The negative income contained in its merchandise is the tax that the peasant pays to society to <br> do not descend the condition of proletarian. Or as Marx teaches us: <br> “For the small peasant to cultivate its land or buy land to cultivate, it is not necessary, as in <br> normal conditions of capitalist production, that the market price is quite high to provide <br> the average profit, and this is even more valid for a supplement, in the form of income, above this profit <br> average. It is not necessary, therefore, that the market price reaches the value or production price of the <br> product. This is one of the reasons for the price of wheat in countries where <br> PARCELARY BE LOWER THAN IN CITY PRODUCTION COUNTRIES. Part of the surplus work <br> of the peasants dealing with the most unfavorable conditions is given for free to society (...). That <br> Lower price, therefore, results from the poverty of producers and not from work productivity. ” <br> (Marx) 355 <br> The peasants are oppressed violently. The estate is content with large lace at the expense of the <br> damage to every nation; dependent on imperialism it becomes the most faithful ally of foreign domination <br> in colonies/semicolonies. We will now seek to demonstrate, theoretically, the mechanisms of suppression and <br> Appropriation of land income by imperialism in its search for maximum profit. <br> 2.3- Suppression or appropriation of the land income of the oppressed nations and peasants by capital <br> monopolist for maximum profit conformation<br>In the topic studied earlier, the maximum profit as a particularity of monopolistic capitalism, we have seen <br> as if the permanent overexploitation of the oppressed nations proletariat and the restriction of the profit of the <br> national bourgeoisie, that is, the non -monopolistic bourgeoisie of colonial and semicolonial countries, <br> They constitute two sources for the conformation of the supervision of financial capital. We saw that the search for <br> maximum profit constitutes a particularity of the imperialist stage, resulting from qualitative changes in the <br> sphere of production and the mode of circulation of free competition capitalism. At the same time, <br> we seek to demonstrate how Marx already considered plausible to modify the Distribution Law <br> social value, that is, the law governing the conformation of a general profit rate that determines an average profit <br> to all capitalists according to the magnitude of their capital. As seen, Marx questioned how <br> would hold the profit rate against the very large concentration of capital compared to small and medium <br> capitalists. In his studies on land income, for example, Marx states that: “(...) small <br> Capitalists, as in part happens in England (….), are content to make profit below the profit <br> medium ”356. <br> In the imperialist stage this trend consolidates, which does not mean the suppression of the general profit rate, <br> only that there is a general profit rate of financial capital, which regulates the distribution of the maximum profit <br> Among the imperialist bourgeoisie in his running race for the dominance of the whole globe; another general rate of <br> profit, which regulates the distribution of monopolistic profit between the bureaucratic and buying bourgeoisie in countries <br> semicolonials; and, finally, a general profit rate, which regulates the distribution of the minimum profit between the <br> national bourgeoisie in a given country. All these settlements in the overexploitation of the proletariat and <br> benefited from the suppression of land income. In semicolonial countries, the suppression of land income <br> of the peasants directly benefits the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and, in part, the national bourgeoisie; and, for <br> imperialist bourgeoisie, the suppression of the land income of the peasants, the agro -export landowner and the <br> nations as a whole (in the exploration of sources of raw material and energy and captive market for <br> goods of their corpostations) is a huge source for conforming their maximum profit. <br> In this way, the study of the Marxist Earth Income Theory helps us to understand that the set of <br> Sources of the maximum imperialist profit are: 1) the permanent overexploitation of the nations proletariat <br> oppressed; 2) the suppression or appropriation of land income from sources of raw materials and energy in <br> colonial/semicolonial countries; 3) Limitation of land income of the semmicolonial agro -export lattation that, <br> Although of enormous figure, it is far below what it would represent if it was capitalist land income; <br> 4) Suppression of land income of peasants; and 5) the restriction of the profit of national bourgeoisie, which <br> Reduced to a minimum profit help to conform the maximum profit of the imperialist bourgeoisie. Three of these sources <br> are directly related to land income: suppression of land income of peasants, limitation of <br> land income of the semicolonial landowner and suppression or appropriation of land income related to sources of <br> raw materials and energy of the oppressed nations. All these particular forms of land income were <br> studied by Marx, quickly reschedule some of his conclusions about these three sources and their <br> Importance for the global functioning of capitalist production. About the peasant production Marx concludes <br> what: <br> “The moral of history, which can be extracted from other observations on agriculture, is that the system <br> capitalist opposes a rational agriculture or that rational agriculture is incompatible with the <br> capitalist system (which in the meantime favors its technical development) and needs the action of the <br> small farmer who lives from his own work, or control of associated producers. ” <br> (Marx) 357 <br> That is, insofar as the peasant economy sells its production for a value below the price of its <br> Cost, this contributes to the bourgeoisie to increase the added value, as it allows it to reduce salaries. No <br> because peasant production, parcel, is more productive than large production, but because it does not <br> Requiring medium profit or capitalist land income benefits the bourgeoisie by increasing the rate of added value <br> and the profit rate. In turn, the semicolonial landowner, upon the agricultural goods produced <br> Costs of the natural riches of the oppressed nations, helps the imperialist bourgeoisie in reducing income <br> land in its own country, and especially providing this increase in surplus value as <br> the concentration of the earth imposes the existence of a peasant economy permanently ruined in the<br>food production below its cost: <br> “(...) in a country like the United States [in the nineteenth century], (...) it is possible for a long time (...) that the <br> surplus value produced by the lessee above the average profit is not performed on the price of its <br><br><br> product, but has to share it with the capitalist brothers, such as the added value of all <br> goods, which when performed in the price, gives them an excess profit, raises the respective rate <br> of profit above general. In this case it would rise the general profit rate because wheat etc., like other <br> Manufactured goods, would be sold below the value. This sale below the value does not <br> would constitute exception, but rather would prevent wheat from constituting an exception in the face of other <br> goods of the same category. ” (Marx) 358 <br> This situation, particular from the United States in the nineteenth century, whose production of wheat for the English market <br> Provided the increase in the general profit rate for the bourgeoisie of England, becomes the market rule <br> world food in the imperialist stage. The agricultural goods of the oppressed nations, as a rule, are <br> Sold below its value, below the production price of the worst land; although it increases huge profits and, <br> Therefore, they do not constitute a class oppressed by imperialism, pocket money the costs of dilapidation <br> of the natural riches of the semicolonial countries in consortium with the imperialist powers. Similar situation <br> with the raw materials, whose reduction in market price below the production price, will already be <br> highlighted as a decisive economic measure, by Marx, to increase the profit rate: <br> “This is the importance of the industrial countries of low prices (...) raw materials. <br> It is also inferred that foreign trade influences the profit rate, even though all its <br> Influence on wages, by cheaping the necessary subsistence means. (…) Economists <br> prisoners of the general principles, such as Ricardo, are unaware, on the other hand, the influence of the <br> world trade in profit rate. ” (Marx) 359 <br> Marx, unlike Ricardo, shows the double importance of the world market in shaping the <br> profit, both in trade in raw materials at low prices, as it results in constant capital economy and, <br> Therefore, reduction of cost price and increased capitalist profit; and by reducing the means of <br> Subsistence, food, as they allow salary reduction and increased value rate. In this way, <br> It is clear that for imperialism the suppression of capitalist land income, which would fit the goods <br> agricultural and minerals produced in colonies/semicolonies, constitute an unprecedented source for <br> Obtaining maximum profit. The methods of suppression of land income by financial capital obey the <br> same logic employed in all economic relations of monopolies. That is, the monopolistic control of <br> production and circulation, allows financial capital to suppress the capitalist income of primary products from <br> colonies/semicolonies, be paying a modest compensation, royalties capable of bribery <br> numerous colonial/semicolonial landing class that, although relatively high values, are very <br> Below what would be the capitalist land income for these goods. Or financial capital resorts to <br> employment of dynamite, so used by Yankee imperialism, to loot the natural resources of nations <br> oppressed. As Lenin points out about this logic: <br> “The monopoly paves the way everywhere, using all means, from the payment of <br> an 'modest' compensation to the US resource of employment of dynamite against the <br> competitor." (Lenin) 360 <br> The result of the use of these two methods by imperialism is always the same: the control of capital <br> financial about all the production of colonial/semicolonial countries. When this control is established, the <br> land income that had previously been suppressed becomes artificially high, establishing <br> Thus the particular form of the market price at the imperialist season: the monopoly price. This phenomenon was <br> Studied by Marx, but was an exception in the circulation mode of free competition. As demonstrated <br> Lenin, becomes the norm in the imperialist stage: “(...) where it is possible to seize all or the most <br> important sources of raw materials, the appearance of cartels and the constitution of monopolies are <br> particularly easy. (...) govern monopoly prices ”361. <br> The monopoly price itself, as we mentioned, is a phenomenon distinct from the price of <br> Monopoly of agricultural goods resulting from absolute income. This is an important economic issue, <br> to understand the particular characteristics of the imperialist monopoly. We saw that income theory <br> absolute formulated by Marx elucid<br>if the law of value is violated. In the case of agricultural goods there is a monopoly price not because they sell themselves <br> these goods above their value, but because it is the market price higher than the production price of the worst <br> ground. In this case, it is the absolute income that generates the monopoly price. In the case of the monopoly price <br> itself, the opposite is given, it is the monopoly that generates income: <br><br><br> “These are two things to distinguish: (1) or the income derives from the monopoly price because there <br> independent monopoly price of products or soil itself, or (2) the products are sold to <br> Monopoly price for existing income. (…) The monopoly price there generates income. On the other hand, income <br> generates the monopoly price when cereals are sold above the production price and still above the <br> value due to the land property prevents the application of capital in uncultivated lands, if it does not <br> pay you income. ” (Marx) 362 <br> The maximum imperialist profit is precisely in this case: it is an income generated by the monopoly price <br> and not generated by the remuneration of the worst land. The maximum profit of imperialism is income generated by the price <br> monopoly; This monopoly price in turn is guaranteed by the monopolistic control of production and <br> violence in interimperialist competition and, especially, by the national subjugation of countries <br> oppressed. The typical monopoly price of imperialism and the income it provides, costing a <br> violation of the law of value? That is, it is possible to obtain a consistent income from the price of monopoly, <br> sale of goods for a price above their value? Yes, it is possible that this occurs, without violating the law <br> value; Let's see how Marx deals with the question: <br> “Finally, if the leveling of the average value in average profit finds, in the different branches of production, <br> obstacles in artificial or natural monopolies and especially in the earth's monopoly, so that <br> It is possible to make monopoly price above the production price and above the value of the goods <br> Object of the monopoly, the limits given by the value of the goods would not be eliminated. O <br> monopoly price of certain goods would only transfer part of the profit of others <br> goods producers. Would be indirectly and topical disturbed the office of the surplus value <br> Among the different branches of production, but would not change the limit of the surplus value. The goods <br> with monopoly price, if you enter the necessary consumption of the worker, will rise the salary and in <br> consequence will reduce surplus value if the worker continues to receive the value of his <br> work. May reduce the salary at the level of the workforce, but only if the salary <br> is above the minimum vital limit. In this case, the monopoly price would be paid upon reduction <br> of the real salary (the mass of value that the worker receives in exchange for a given mass of <br> work) and the profit of other capitalists. The limits within which the monopoly price <br> would impair the normal regulation of goods prices would be clearly defined and could <br> be exactly calculated. ” (Marx) 363 <br> Marx provides us with a brilliant analysis of the global operation of the monopoly price, very important <br> for the deeper understanding of imperialism. The monopoly price, the sale of a goods <br> for price above its value, or its production price, does not allow greater creation of wealth, a <br> Additional production of added value. What the monopoly price allows is a greater concentration of wealth <br> for those capital that control the production of goods that can be sold at this price. A <br> realization of the monopoly price of a commodity occurs at the expense of the profit of other capitalists and the <br> greater exploitation of the proletariat. In the world market, therefore, it is not possible that all goods <br> are sold at monopoly price, but as this price ensures the income that conforms to the maximum profit, it is <br> easy to conclude that the goods produced by financial capital are those that can impose <br> Monopoly price as its market price. Constitutes a particular form of the interimperialist competition to <br> dispute for production and market conditions that ensure the monopoly price. <br> But how does land income be behaved in this assault of added value to the monopoly price? <br> We depart once again Marx's considerations on the question: <br> “Capital profit (businessman's profit + interest) and land income, therefore, <br> private components of the value of the value, categories that are distinguished according to this is intended for <br> Capital or land property, classification, however, that in no way alters its essence. The sum of these <br> components forms the whole more social value. ” (Marx) 364 <br> All social value value can be divided into two parts: profit from capital and land income. More-<br>Valia can only be created in the production process, land income does not compose the value of goods, as <br> Suppose Smith's value theory, it is a portion of the added value extracted by landowners <br> capitalists after completing the production process. Land income does not create value, absorbs value. Only as <br> negative income, that is, as unchallenged land income, allows the creation of more <br> social value. Imperialism acts to suppress, nullify the land income of the oppressed nations and <br><br><br> peasants of these; On the other hand, it seeks to raise it artificially when it becomes monopolistic as us <br> Examples of Lenin from the sugar and cement cartel. What is always at stake is the total added value <br> produced by society that cannot be added by the price of monopoly, but can be redistributed from <br> different way, which implies the existence of different profit rates: monopolistic profit and non- <br> monopolist. <br> In his average profit analysis, Marx demonstrates that the added value produced directly in agriculture <br> Participates in the conformation of the general profit rate. This is because the added value produced in agriculture when serving <br> for the payment of absolute land income to the landowners, it does not conform to the social value to be <br> divided between the different branches of industry. As seen, Marx assumes that all the added value produced in the <br> agriculture is retained by landowners in the form of land income, not allowing the <br> surplus value produced in agriculture is divided to other capitals. In the imperialist phase of capitalism, this <br> principle discovered by Marx remains valid, because the added value produced in agriculture in fact follows without <br> compose the general profit rate. Financial capital from colonial/semicolonial domain <br> on the part of this added value that in free competition capitalism would be responsible for landowners. At the <br> However, financial capital appropriates part of this added value not for the benefit of the general profit rate, <br> but of the maximum imperialist profit. <br> In relation to monopolistic income, that is, that income generated by the monopoly price, as is the typical case of <br> Maximum imperialist profit, Marx analyzes it as follows: <br> “Even the monopoly income (...) will be certainly fraction of the surplus value of other goods, this <br> It is, of the goods that change for this commodity that has a monopoly price. The sum of profit <br> medium and land income cannot be greater than the magnitude that both are parts and that <br> It is preexed to this office. ” (Marx) 365 <br> The sum of capital profit and land income conform to the totality of the social value produced by <br> society. Under the conditions of free competition capitalism, where the average profit law governs, income <br> Total land will be the result of the subtraction of total added value by the average global profit. At the time of <br> Imperialimo, the profit of financial capital needs to advance the land income of the oppressed nations to <br> become maximum profit. The imperialist bourgeoisie thus, in the lands of the semicolonies, its project of <br> suppression of private property of the earth. However, it suppresses private property over natural forces <br> Of the oppressed nations not to social progress, but for colonial enslavement of the maximum profit. When <br> controls the set of primary production in semicolonies, the imperialist bourgeoisie artificially increases the <br> Land income, which becomes monopolistic and not typically capitalist. Does it not for the benefit of the <br> where natural riches are extracted, but due to its gigantic capitalist accumulation. <br> In this way, financial capital seeks to artificially increase the land income of primary production <br> Under its control, in order not to reduce the profit of its own capital, but to reduce that of its competitors; <br> subtracting part of the previously appropriate added value. In this game of forces of financial capital, the <br> Rentist and parasitic content of imperialism that seeks to increase the price of primary products auvering <br> Monopolistic land income as a component of its maximum profit. Of course this finds a limit <br> in the capitalist production itself, because the dismissal increase in the price of raw materials and food <br> It implies reducing the rate of added value and profit rate by raising the value of the workforce. <br> But it is under these conditions that the phenomena of the competition of great capital occurs at the time of the <br> imperialism. <br> The phenomenon of the suppression of land income of semicolonial countries in the world market was quite <br> studied in the 1950s. The process characterized by President Mao as “exchange of values <br> unequal ”366, in the exploration relationship between imperialism and the Chinese peasantry, it was not a process <br> local, but of global coverage. Numerous statistical data raised at that time proved the<br>Imposition by financial capital of an international price monopolized of industrialized production. This one <br> monopolistic price, as we have seen, implied a greater capital profit that was offset by reducing the <br> Land income that would fit the primary products of the oppressed nations. This is the economic cause that <br> Explains the monopoly price of manufactured goods and the deficit in the prices of primary products. <br><br><br> After the 1970s, there is a reverse phenomenon, but in which the same essence is retained: there is a <br> significant increase in the price of primary products. This implied a greater realization of income <br> Land in these articles, particularly in oil. At first it causes a problem for imperialism, because <br> tends to decrease the profit of financial capital. But this is circumvented by imperialism as this <br> gradually assumes, through the intertwining of financial capital, economic, political and <br> military of these sources of raw material. The strengthening of the state of Israel, as a generation of imperialism <br> Yankee, in the Middle East, is part of this policy of control of the region's oil sources, as well as the <br> Usa's intertwining with the Saudi monarchy. This condition only reinforces the importance of the advancement of <br> Palestinian National Resistance Heroic for the world proletarian revolution. <br> In this way, Yankee imperialism with its capitals exported to oil producing countries <br> Infringes additional profit when the price of oil is high; On the other hand, it loses profit insofar as <br> The oil monopoly price implies a reduction in capital profit. Today, Yankee imperialism is a <br> large oil producer, but oil extraction in Yankee territory occurs in drilling rocks from <br> Betuminous shale. This is the worst terrain of oil production, as it is of the lowest economic fertility. For <br> that the producers Ianques earns profit it is necessary that the market price goes up until they get income <br> Absolute, in addition to a sumptuous profit. Therefore it matters to Yankee imperialism that oil is above <br> From the $ 50 the barrel. However, as an industrialized economy, whose capitals control large sectors <br> of industrial production, it does not matter that the price rises far above this level, on the contrary, <br> Atomic superpower Russia, whose industrialization is lower and the most fertile oil sources come out <br> benefited from the artificial increase in the price of oil. Yankee imperialism, as it is the worst ground, <br> It is essential to remove more fertile sources from the competition controlled by capitals of diverse powers. Per <br> means of the war and the policy of embargo, restricts as much as possible, participation in the world market for <br> Iran and Venezuela raw oil, for example. This military control, economically artificial, is inaccurate <br> For Yankee imperialism to conform the maximum profit of their corporations. As the background of this question is the <br> particular behavior of land income at the time of imperialism. <br> The same question can be said in relation to soy. USA and Brazil are today the two largest producers worldwide <br> soy, whose production is built by China. Although, there is a lot of Yankee capital <br> exported to this production in our country, Brazilian sobroads also appear as competitors of the <br> Yankee soy. Of course it is a completely disproportionate competition, because most of the soy <br> Produced in Brazil depends on seeds, pesticides and machinery produced in USA; so that the <br> Growth of soy production here directly benefits the economy of imperialist superpower. At the <br> However, as the soy production in Brazil grows, there is a tendency to reduce the price of <br> market, a situation that would directly benefit Chinese imperialism, but which would harm the <br> Financial capital applied to Yankee soy. With the process of war in Ukraine, the invasion of superpower <br> atomic Russia, from the Ukrainian territory, the production price of agricultural inputs increased, increasing the <br> Soy cost price produced in both USA and Brazil. Here, the impact was distinct, because the <br> expansion of soy planting to the Amazon region allowed a relative advantage over the <br> Competition of Yankee soy. With new land of the overthrown forest, fewer inputs were consumed to <br> produce a larger amount of soy per hectare. By this trend, the state of Mato Grosso quickly, <br> In its Amazonian area, it became the largest soy producer in the country, surpassing the state of Paraná. That <br> High fertility allowed a greater advance of Brazilian soybeans in compraction with the Yankee. One of the forms <br> of the imperialism of the USA to limit this competition is the intensification of its environmental policy, <br> monitoring of the overthrow of the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado, aiming at not the conservation of the natural environment and<br>of our national wealth, but to ensure that the best land is expelled from the market, <br> thus ensuring the maximum profit for its financial capital invested in the production of Yankee soy. <br> Artificial lifting phenomena of land income can also be observed in Europe. The deal <br> European agricultural (AOA), for example, establishes the number of hectares that should be <br> Produced in each country, as well as what will be produced. Lands forced to leave the competition receive <br> A land income paid by the European Union are paid for nothing to produce. This artificial form of <br> Limiting competition aims to ensure a higher market price for French wine, for example. This is, <br> Therefore, an imperialist policy of manipulating land income to earn maximum profit. It is aimed at <br> Also, in this case, social control. Therefore, the taxation imposed by the European Union, to the milk of Uruguay, for <br> example, it aims to artificially conserve the land income of small milk producers on the continent <br> European. What European society pays to the most for its food, ensures this artificial form of <br><br><br> Small production yield. This is a way of European imperialism, keeping under its control and <br> corporately the continent's peasantry, which in the 1990s gave important demonstrations of <br> Fighting and organization capacity. This phenomenon was studied by Lenin and is analogous to that of the aristocracy <br> Worker: <br> “In addition, a characteristic trait of Danish imperialism is to obtain superlukers, thanks to <br> its advantageous monopolistic situation in the dairy and meat market market: by the more <br> Cheap, provides Londes, the largest market in the world. Despite this, the Danish bourgeoisie and the <br> Dane rich peasants (bourgeois of pure strain, despite the fables of Russian populists) <br> converted to 'prosperous' parasites of the English imperialist bourgeoisie, and share their <br> particularly safe and particularly abundant profits. ” (Lenin) 367 <br> This phenomenon of a peasant aristocracy in imperialist countries is another byproduct of this stage <br> particular of capitalism. It is important to be studied, because its existence today shows that despite <br> partially paralyzed, this class, as the crisis of imperialism deepens, may constitute <br> important strength alongside the proletariat in socialist revolutions in imperialist countries. Just like the <br> working aristocracy cannot be maintained for long, the same will occur with this aristocracy <br> Peasant. <br> The study of imperialism and Marxist theory of land income, allow us to understand in a <br> deeper the current phenomena and the perspectives of the world proletarian revolution. The domain of this <br> Marxist Arsenal of Political Economy, it is key to understanding the relationship between contradictions <br> fundamental in the world today and because the contradiction between oppressed nations and imperialism is the <br> main contradiction of the time. <br> 3- The main contradiction of the monopolistic stage of the capitalist process <br> The struggle of two lines that traveled MCI in 2022, driven by the publication of the base of <br> Discussion, proposed by the parties and organizations that made up the then CCIMU, focused on <br> special way in the issue of fundamental contradictions in the world and which of which today constitutes the <br> main contradiction. Rightly the struggle should focus on this point, because its correct delimitation is <br> It is essential for the establishment of a political line common to MCI, which allows its unification. <br> On this issue also gave important fights of two lines during CIMU itself and how <br> result of this struggle, the political and principles of LCI's principles established that: <br> “The process of capitalist society as a whole has as its fundamental contradiction to <br> contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, but when it goes from non -monopolistic capitalism to <br> monopolistic capitalism, or imperialism, develop in the world three contradictions <br> Fundamental: <br> First contradiction: between oppressed nations, on the one hand, and superpowers and imperialist powers, <br> for another. This is the main contradiction at the present time and, at the same time, the contradiction <br> main of the time of imperialism. <br> Second contradiction: between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. <br> Third contradiction: interimperialist. ” (LCI) 368 <br> This definition is an important political leap in the MCI line, as it develops the established by the <br> PCCH in the 1963 Chinese Letter, as well as rectifies important errors and deviations in the MRI statement <br> 1984, already pointed out by the PCP in the 1980s. Continuing the debate and the fight around this issue is <br> Important to raise MCI's understanding of the foundations of its general political line. Our <br> Party estimates that the debate in 2022 was fruitful, as it served to clarify many issues. As part of<br>struggle of two lines that follows in MCI, after the founding of the LCI, we also manifest publicly <br> on this issue, taking it in two aspects, one first: philosophical and a second: economic and <br> political. Before analyzing this key issue of MCI from these two aspects we will make a brief <br> retrospective of the development of formulations on this theme in the course of the development of ideology <br><br><br> of the international proletariat. Thus we aim to counter the terminological tergiversactions made by UOC (MLM) <br> in debates last year. <br> In studying, the economic essence of capitalist society, Marx masterfully established the <br> Economic fundamentals of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie. In anti-dühring, Engels finished <br> This formulation, presenting it in its most developed form. In utopian socialism to socialism <br> scientific, the formulation becomes even more accurate, as Engels already incorporates in this the emerging elements <br> of monopolistic capital in the analysis of Genesis, development and resolution of the contradiction. Highlighted <br> following the transformation of free competition into monopoly: <br> “When reaching a certain phase of development, it is no longer enough for this form; the great <br> national producers of an industrial branch are unite to form a truste, a consortium <br> intended to regulate production; determine the total amount that must be produced, divide <br> Among them and thus impose a sales price in advance fixed. (…) In the trustes, the free <br> Competition becomes a monopoly and the production without a plan of capitalist society <br> Capitula before the planned and organized production of the nascent socialist society. Of course, <br> At the moment, for the benefit and benefit of the capitalists. ” (Engels) 369 <br> And summarizes as follows the fundamental contradiction and its manifestations: <br> “Production becomes a social act; the exchange and, with it, the appropriation remains acts <br> Individuals: The social product is appropriate by the individual capitalist. Fundamental contradiction, <br> which derive all the contradictions in which today's society moves and that the large industry <br> clearly highlights: <br> A) (…) bourgeois and proletariat antithesis. <br> B) (…) contradiction between the social organization within each factory and the social anarchy of the <br> Total production. <br> C) (…) UNLECTED DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTIVE FORCES, OVER OFFER ON THE DESCRIPTION, <br> Overproduction, cracking of markets, crisis every ten years, vicious circle: overproduction <br> (…) Contradiction is sharpened until it becomes a contradiction: the mode of production revolts <br> against the form of exchange. The bourgeoisie proves to be unable to continue to direct its own forces <br> productive social. (…) <br> D) partial recognition of the social character of the productive forces, pulling their own <br> capitalists. Appropriation of large production and transportation organisms, first by <br> corporations, then by the Trustes, and later by the state. ” (Engels) 370 <br> Developing the formulated in anti-dühring, Engels then demonstrates that the constitution of monopolies <br> private and state in capitalism corresponds to the compulsory partial recognition of the social character of <br> productive forces, but not the resolution of this contradiction. When President Mao, in about the <br> Contradiction, summarizes the Marxist findings in the social sciences, part precisely of this formulation of <br> Engels, and establishes the question as follows: <br> “When Marx applied this law [that of contradiction] to the study of the economic structure of society <br> capitalist, he found that the fundamental contradiction of this society was the contradiction between the <br> social character of production and the private character of property. Such contradiction is manifested by <br> contradiction between the organized character of production in isolated companies and the <br> organized from production at the scale of the whole society. And, in class relations, manifests itself in <br> contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat ”. (President Mao) 371 <br> That is, the economic foundation of the social contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie is the contradiction between the <br> social production and capitalist private appropriation. In turn, as the economic base is not restricted to <br> sphere of production, the fundamental contradiction manifests itself as a reflection of the sphere of circulation, that is, the <br> free competition on production, such as the contradiction between the organized character of production in the <br> individual companies and the anarchic character of social production. Improving the formulation of Engels, the <br> President Mao presents the same fundamental contradiction, in his different manifestations: politics and <br><br><br> economic (production and circulation). Both are dealing with the same question, so much so that Engels summarizes <br> following the proletarian revolution: <br> Proletarian revolution, solution of contradictions: the proletariat takes the political power and, through<br>It converts to public property the social means of production (…). From now on it is already <br> possible social production according to a previously elaborated plan. The development of <br> Production transforms a class survival into anachronism. As the <br> Anarchy of social production, the political authority of the state is also diluting. Men, <br> owners, at the end of their own social existence, become lords of nature, masters of themselves <br> same, free men. ” (Engels) 372 <br> The resolution of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie, in its political aspect, begins with the <br> of power by the proletariat and, in the economic aspect, socialization of the means of production and planning of <br> production, now totally socialized. This set of measures transforms the classes into anachronism <br> social and the state is extinguished, losing part by its duties until its complete extinction <br> With the disappearance of the traces of the classes, culminating the proletarian revolution with communism. O <br> President Mao Enhances and simplifies the formulation of Engels, showing the same social contradiction in <br> Its different manifestations, economic and political. The content of the formulation, however, is the same. <br> Regarding Stalin's formulation of the most important contradictions, in the imperialist stage, something occurs <br> like. Stalin, also starting from the same formulation as Engels, analyzes the <br> most important contradictions in the imperialist time: <br> “Lenin called the imperialism of 'agonizing capitalism'. Why? Because imperialism leads to <br> contradictions of capitalism to its maximum limit, to its extreme degree, beyond which <br> revolution. Among these contradictions there are three that should be considered as the most <br> Important: <br> The first contradiction is that existing between work and capital. <br> (…) <br> The second contradiction is that existing between the different financial groups and the different powers <br> Imperialists in their struggle for sources of raw materials, for the territories of others. <br> (…) <br> The third contradiction is that existing between a handful of "civilized" nations and hundreds <br> millions of men from colonies and dependent countries. <br> (…) <br> Such are, in general, the main contradictions of imperialism, which converted the old <br> 'Flowering' capitalism in agonizing capitalism. ” (Stalin) 373 <br> President Mao, when referring precisely to this passage states that: <br> “Stalin, in explaining the historical roots of Leninism in its famous work the foundations of <br> Leninism, analyzed the different contradictions of capitalism, reached its extreme degree under the <br> conditions of imperialism and showed how they made the proletarian revolution a practical issue <br> immediate and created the favorable conditions for the direct assault on capitalism. ” (President Mao) 374 <br> President Mao could not repeat the same term used by Stalin, main contradictions of the <br> imperialism, precisely because in contradiction was formulating for the first in the history of <br> Marxism that in every complex process, in which there are many contradictions, in a certain phase <br> There will always be only one main contradiction. Stalin is not dealing, on the grounds of Leninism, <br> of this philosophical issue, so it uses as synonyms most important contradictions and contradictions <br> main. Then the qualitative leap in the Marxist philosophy established by President Mao, <br> Of course, these terms can no longer be used as synonyms. Regarding the content <br> political and social, there is no difference between the formulation of Stalin and President Mao on this issue, in the <br> However, there is an important improvement in the formulation of the contradictions of the imperialist time, <br> improvement this corresponding to the development in philosophy achieved in the third stage of the <br> Marxism. That is, when dealing with a phenomenon, by identifying its contradictions it is necessary to establish <br> what are the fundamental contradictions and, of these, which is the main in each stage of the process of <br> transformation of that phenomenon. <br><br><br> Therefore, in the Chinese letter, the CCP thus presents the contradictions of the imperialist time: <br> “The starting point to define the general line of the international communist movement, is an analysis <br> concrete classes, economy and politics worldwide and the concrete conditions of the <br> World, this is the fundamental contradictions in the contemporary world. <br> (…) <br> What are the fundamental contradictions in the contemporary world? Marxist-Leninists support <br> invariably that they are: <br> - The contradiction between the socialist field and the imperialist field; <br> - the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in capitalist countries; <br> - contradiction between the oppressed nations and imperialism; <br> - The contradiction between imperialist countries and between monopolistic groups. ” (CPCH) 375<br>President Mao, when referring to the development of the Chinese Revolution, also uses the <br> fundamental contradictions for process characterization: <br> “The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation and the contradiction between feudalism and the great <br> Popular masses constitute the fundamental contradictions of modern Chinese society. (…) But <br> The contradiction between imperialism and the Chinese nation is the main contradiction. ” (President Mao) 376 <br> This improvement of the nomenclature of the concepts, made by President Mao, both in relation to Engels <br> Like Stalin, they correspond to the philosophical development of the Maoist Step. It makes no sense, therefore, <br> continuing using terms that were not wrong when used, they became outdated with the <br> Development of ideology. We must unify, therefore, the concepts and, instead of more contradictions <br> important, we adopt fundamental contradictions and we will highlight within them what is the contradiction <br> main. Waste a lot of time on this issue, as UOC's direction (MLM) does, is to reduce the philosophical debate <br> to a matter of semantics that shuffles the issue to confuse - especially themselves. <br> Seeking to respond to the PCC-FR, they criticize it for “abandoning the idea of the most <br> important to welcome the fundamental contradictions ”. And UOC (mlm) even find this <br> “Error” in the CCCH document: <br> “Returning to the problem of fundamental contradiction, no doubt the '25 points' or‘ Letter <br> 1963 Chinese ’incurs inaccuracy by planting four fundamental contradictions.” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 377 <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) says that we who conform to LCI we sink “the general line of 1963 as <br> if it were the tablets of Moses. ” What we do is take it as the most advanced formulation of the general <br> MCI, during President Mao, and we seek to apply it to the new conditions. At the same time, <br> We identify limits in this very important document, such as the lack of specification of which <br> It was the main contradiction in the world. Similarly, we recognize the positive aspect that represented the <br> 1984 MRI conference, but mainly we criticize ideological and political errors in its <br> Declaration, expression of the rotten Avakianist theses, so applauded by UOC (MLM). In this statement, the <br> issue of fundamental contradiction appears formulated as follows: <br> “All the most important contradictions of the world imperialist system are accentuating <br> Quickly: the contradiction between the distinct imperialist powers; the contradiction between the <br> imperialism and the oppressed peoples and nations of the world and the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the <br> proletariat in imperialist countries. All these contradictions have a common origin: the mode of <br> capitalist production and its fundamental contradiction. The rivalry between the two imperialist blocks, <br> headed by the US and the USSR, respectively, will inevitably lead to war, the less <br> that the revolution prevents it, and this rivalry is already having a great influence on <br> world events. ” (MRI) 378 <br> The great mistake implicit in this formulation is that it is contained in it one of the dogmas of Avakianism: the <br> Interimperialist contradiction is the engine of history. For this reason, it appears listed as the first contradiction and <br><br><br> highlighted at the end as the contradiction that will greatly influence world events. Other <br> error, which our party judges the necessary correction, is the characterization today of the contradiction between proletariat <br> and bourgeoisie as restricted to imperialist countries. After all, already in the beginning of imperialism, as it demonstrates <br> Stalin in the fundamentals of Leninism, this contradiction becomes international, in force in all countries of the <br> World, regardless of the percentage of workers in the population of an oppressed nation. <br> Compared to the 25 -point letter, we consider that there are two inaccuracies, resulting from the weight of the <br> Right in the direction of the CCP, before GRCP. The first inaccuracy already mentioned above is that they are <br> Four fundamental contradictions are presented, but it is not specified which one is the main one. In the end, <br> according to the law of contradiction fully established by President Mao, being the world at the time <br> Imperialist a complex process in which there are several contradictions, one of them is the main contradiction. <br> In the case this is, as President Mao always stated, the contradiction between nation and imperialism, <br> relying on the formulated by the great Lenin that the time of imperialism the world was divided between <br> a handful of advanced nations, powers, on the one hand, and for the vast majority of late nations, for <br> other. <br> The second inaccuracy is in the characterization of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie in countries only <br> capitalists; This coincides, in part, with the position of Liu Shao-Chi, who defended the Farster Theory of the End of<br>contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie in socialism. These two errors were rectified by the CCP, in the <br> preparatory debates and resolutions of its 9th Congress in 1969. The Political Declaration and Principles <br> approved in CIMU corrects all these issues and therefore constitutes the most developed formulation of <br> Marxist-Leninist-Maoist to MCI. <br> 3.1- The philosophical aspect of the problem <br> Clarified the content of the issue and demonstrated the biblical misrepresentation that makes the direction of UOC (MLM), <br> Let us fully address its philosophical aspect. There are two important philosophical problems in this <br> debate: 1) the dialectical relationship between universality and particularity of contradiction, and 2) the question of <br> main contradiction in a process and in the stages of this process. These two problems are part of the law <br> contradiction and are already sufficiently clarified by President Mao. Your resolution, therefore, can <br> be found directly on the contradiction itself. <br> Let's start with the first problem: <br> In its formulation of the law of contradiction, President Mao highlights the need for the study of <br> universality and the particularity of contradiction. It begins its exposure with the universality of contradiction, <br> because it is the simplest aspect, and defines that the universality or absolute character of contradiction is <br> that contradiction exists in the process of all things and phenomena and that its existence travels from the beginning <br> until the end of the whole process. Thus shows that at the beginning of a phenomenon, even if the struggle between contrary <br> Not apparent, the contradiction is already present. Moreover, it demonstrates that “the universality of <br> contradiction ”“ resides in the particularity of contradiction ”, establishing the dialectical relationship in advance, <br> contradictory, between the universal and the particular. <br> After this definition, “the special analysis of the particularity” of the contradiction begins. This is an analysis <br> special because it is the most complex particularity than universality, and more difficult to understand <br> by dogmatic thinking. Shows that various forms of movement of matter each have a <br> particular character. That in the study of contradiction it is necessary to take what is common between a certain <br> form of movement of matter and other qualitatively distinct forms and, especially, is made <br> It is necessary to examine what is particularly in that form of movement studied. The common element <br> between different forms of movement is the universal aspect, what is distinguished in each form of <br> movement constitutes its trait or particular aspect. <br> Shows how different sciences, because they study different forms of movement of matter, deal with <br> different particular contradictions and points out that in the social sciences the particular contradiction is in how <br> The contradiction between productive forces and production relations manifests itself. Reveals, however, that in every way <br> of the movement of matter there are different processes that are qualitatively different from the <br> that, therefore, it is not enough to study only the particular contradiction of a large system of <br><br><br> forms of movement of matter, which is necessary to study “(...) the particular contradiction and the essence of <br> each process ”379 In this form of movement. To discover the particularity of contradictions in the process <br> development of something or phenomenon, that is, the essence of this process, highlights the need for <br> study “the particularity of each aspect of each contradiction”. <br> Finally, it points out that it is not enough to study the particular contradictions of a process and the opposite aspects of <br> each of the contradictions of this process; in the study, of the particularity of contradiction, it is necessary, <br> also, study the particular traits of each of the stages of the development process of a <br> thing: <br> “Not only the total process of the movement of contradictions in the development of one thing, <br> considered in its interconnection, and each aspect of each contradiction have traces <br> particular, to which we must pay attention, but each step also has its traits <br> individuals, which must be equally served. ”380 <br> Concludes by stating that “(…) the fundamental contradiction of the process of developing something” and the <br> essence of this process do not disappear until this process is not ended. Emphasizes, however, that in a <br> given process “the situation varies from step to step”, although, this does not mean that the contradiction <br> fundamental process is changed in the course of these steps. That is, in the course of the development of a <br> same process, when succeeding steps in these, each will have particular traits, which do not imply <br> in modifying the essence of this process. <br> In short, in the study of the particularity of the contradiction, President Mao part of the forms of movement <br> of matter, advances to the different processes existing within a certain form of movement<br>of matter, until it reaches the different stages of the process of developing one thing. Here already <br> presents the dialectical relationship between the universality and the particularity of contradiction: the characteristics <br> common in different forms of movement of matter constitute the universal aspect, while the traits <br> distinct, constitute the particularity of each form. Taking the same form of movement, each <br> process has particular contradictions, while what is common to these processes is its <br> Universality. Taking separately a single process of developing one thing, the <br> particular contradiction that distinguishes it from other processes, becomes the universal aspect of this process, <br> while the specific characteristics of each step constitute the particularity of a step against <br> Another step. <br> After studying philosophically this dialectical movement from Universal to the particular, President Mao illustrates <br> This process with the examples of social science, discovered by Marxism. Thus shows that Marx and <br> Engels, in studying society, as a certain form of movement of matter, discovered the <br> contradiction between productive forces and production relations, the contradiction between the exploited classes and <br> Explorers and, originating from these, the contradiction between the economic base and the superstructure. When applying the law <br> contradiction in the study of a process determined within this form of movement, that is, <br> capitalist society, points out that Marx discovered the fundamental contradiction of this society between the character <br> social production and the private character of property - as seen in the previous topic. And describes the <br> dialectical relationship between universal and private present in Marxist discoveries: <br> “Since the variety of things is immeasurable and their development has no limits, which is <br> Universal in a context is particularly made in another context, and vice versa. The inherent contradiction <br> to the capitalist system, among the social character of production and private property of the means of <br> production is common to all countries from which there is and develops capitalism, and therefore <br> universal in relation to this. However, the proper contradiction of capitalism corresponds only to a <br> certain historical stage in the development of class society in general and, therefore, has <br> particular character in relation to the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production <br> within the class society in general. ” (President Mao) 381 <br> What is universal in a context is particular in another context, and vice versa, this is the essence of the relationship <br> dialectic between universality and particularity, both are interdependent, opposite and, in certain <br> Circumstances, become each other. The contradiction between social production and private appropriation, by <br> example, when the capitalist society is taken as a process, it constitutes the universal aspect of this <br> process. However, when it is the class society that is taken as a process and society <br><br><br> capitalist as a stage of this process, the contradiction between social production and private appropriation, constitutes the <br> particular aspect in the capitalist society of contradiction between productive forces and production relations. <br> In this passage it is possible to note, therefore, the dialectical relationship between process and step managed by the <br> President Mao. In taking, class society as a whole, capitalist society is a stage of this <br> process; In turn, if the capitalist society is taken as a process, imperialism is a stage <br> particular of this process. <br> And President Mao concludes the chapter of the particularity of contradiction to give us the example of <br> Analysis of the Stalin comrade on the particular contradictions of the imperialist stage of the capitalist process. <br> It states, as soon as: <br> “The particular and the universal are united, and not only the particularity, but also the <br> universality of contradiction are inherent in every thing: universality lies in <br> particularity; So when studying something certain, we should try to discover these two <br> sides and their interconnections, the particular and the universal and their interconnection, and to discover the <br> Interconnections between said thing and the numerous things outside it. Stalin, when explaining the roots <br> historical of Leninism (…) analyzed the different contradictions of capitalism, reached its degree <br> extreme under the conditions of imperialism (…). In addition, it analyzed why Russia was the homeland of <br> Leninism, because the Tsarist Russia constituted the point of convergence of all contradictions of the <br> imperialism and because the Russian proletariat became the forefront of the revolutionary proletariat <br> International." (President Mao) 382 <br> In this example three levels are gathered, whose philosophical understanding is key to moving firmly <br> in the common understanding of MCI about contradictions in the world, it is the universal, the private and the<br>specific; that is, capitalism as a process, imperialism as a stage of this process and the <br> Manifestation of the particular contradictions of imperialism in a specific country, in this case Russia. Like this, <br> we have a double relationship between universal and private, first, the particular contradictions of imperialism <br> Faced with the capitalist universal process; and, second, universal contradictions, common to the whole world in <br> imperialist epoch and its particular manifestation in a unique country. Due to this management of the relationship <br> Dialectic between Universal and Private, by Stalin, President Mao says: <br> “Stalin analyzed the universal of the contradictions of imperialism, demonstrating that Leninism is the <br> Marxism of the time of imperialism and the proletarian revolution, and at the same time, what <br> particular had these general contradictions in the case of the imperialism of the tsarist Russia, <br> explaining why Russia became the cradle of theory and tactics of the proletarian revolution and how <br> said particularity ended the universality of contradiction. This analysis of Stalin offers us a <br> model for understanding the particularity and universality of contradiction and its interconnection. ” <br> (President Mao) 383 <br> The particular contradictions of a step cannot suppress the particular contradiction of a process; then <br> If in a stage it was eliminated the particular contradiction of the process, it would no longer be the stage of a <br> process but of a new process. However, there will only be a change of step in the same process, if <br> There were distinct particular contradictions between one stage and another. Were it not like that, there would be no steps in the <br> Process, only mechanical growth of the same contradictions. President Mao shows how <br> through the sharpness of the fundamental contradiction of the process, certain contradictions are deepened, <br> Others are resolved and new contradictions arise. It is this modification of the particular traits in the course of the <br> process of developing something that marks the emergence of a new stage, or the overcoming of <br> an old one. <br> In public debate last year, criticism of the definition of the main contradiction in the world, was raised <br> The argument that highlighting a main contradiction in the world could bring parties and organizations <br> revolutionaries to mechanically and immediately identify the main contradiction in the world with the <br> main contradiction of your country. Although such argument showed insufficiency in understanding the <br> law of contradiction had some meaning as a warning, since in the past, particularly in the years of <br> 1960 and 1970, there was a tendency for parties and malery forces to erroneously identify contradiction <br> main of its revolution with the main contradiction of the time, that is, between oppressed nations and <br> imperialism. Including in the history of the Communist Party of Brazil this error occurred, the different fractions <br> Maoists existing in the Brazilian revolutionary process in that period characterized the military coup <br> fascist of 1964 as a direct intervention of Yankee imperialism, and thus mistakenly defined that <br><br><br> The country's main contradiction was between the nation and imperialism. Thus underestimated the fact that the <br> main contradiction in Brazilian society was the one that opposed the poor peasant <br> expressed as a contradiction between nasses and semi-feudality, manifesting itself in sharp and massive struggle <br> Peasant. There were very significant efforts and results of the maleist intervention in the countryside in that <br> period, notably the heroic guerrillas of Araguaia, the first attempt to trigger the war <br> Popular in our country. However, the error in this understanding of the main contradiction in society and the <br> Brazilian revolution, they opened gaps for the diversion of the Popular War Way to Revisionism, after <br> the military defeat of that important initiative. Which resulted in great ideological damage to the party, <br> with its almost complete settlement. <br> What is needed to prevent this error from repeating is to elevate the understanding and management of the law of <br> contradiction by the communist parties. It is necessary to apprehend the dialectical relationship more <br> between the universal and the private, to apprehend that in the imperialist stage, contradictions are configured <br> distinct individuals from the previous stage of free competition, while maintaining essential characteristics, <br> universal, common. That also these characteristics of imperialism that are particular to the <br> capitalist process as a whole, constitute “the universal of the contradictions of imperialism” that this <br> Universal manifests itself in a particular way in each of the countries of the globe. And that, therefore, the general line <br> MCI cannot never replace the need for the development of the political line of each revolution, which <br> will have their particularities and specificities, as well as, they will have universal aspects common to all<br>The revolutionary processes of the globe. <br> Thus, we entered the second philosophical problem we mentioned: the question of contradiction <br> main in a process and in the steps of this process. President Mao studies him in a chapter part of <br> On contradiction, but emphasizes that the issue of the main contradiction is part of the problem of <br> particularity of contradiction. Shows that in the process of developing a complex thing <br> There are many contradictions and one of them is necessarily the main one. This main contradiction, for its <br> instead, it is the contradiction “whose existence and development determines or influences the existence and <br> development of other contradictions ”384. <br> By illustrating the problem of the main contradiction, President Mao compares the complexity of the processes <br> revolutionaries in imperialist countries with the Chinese revolution. Thus states that in the revolutions in <br> imperialist and capitalist countries developed “the two contradictory forces, the proletariat and the <br> bourgeoisie, constitute the main contradiction ”385. In semicolonial countries, such as China, he says, “ <br> Relationship between the main contradiction and non -main contradictions offers a complex framework ”386. <br> Shows, then, that when imperialism is untied a war of aggression against a semicolonial country <br> different social classes can be temporarily united in a revolutionary national war: <br> “(…) Then, the contradiction between imperialism and the country in question becomes the contradiction <br> main, while all contradictions between the different classes within the country (including the <br> contradiction, which was the main, between the feudal system and the large popular masses) <br> temporarily relegated to a secondary and subordinate position. ” (President Mao) 387 <br> As seen earlier, President Mao considered in the years 1930, the existence of two <br> Fundamental contradictions in Chinese society: between oppressed nation and imperialism; and between feudal system <br> and popular masses. What he is demonstrating now is that, depending on the circumstances, these pairs <br> contradictory can change places and one assume the mainness while the other becomes subordinate, and <br> vice versa. The modification of the main contradiction determines the modification of the stage of the Chinese revolution, <br> Single Front Policy of the CCP and Military Strategy in the Popular War. Perceive the modification of <br> Main contradiction, in a specific revolutionary process is decisive for its correct driving. <br> In doing this analysis of China's revolutionary process, President Mao presents a formulation that is <br> Key to the present controversy of MCI: <br> “But what happens, there is no doubt, that in each stage of development of <br> A process there is only one main contradiction that plays the ruling. ” (President <br> Mao) 388 <br><br><br> That is, in the case of China, until there was no imperialist direct aggression, the main contradiction <br> From that phase of the Chinese revolution was the one that opposed the popular masses to the feudal system. It is this <br> contradiction that determines the party's political and military line. In turn, when there is aggression <br> imperialist, modifies the main contradiction and it governs all the others, including the one who opposes the <br> masses to feudality. Therefore, at the time of the revolutionary national war the President Mao did the <br> distinction between the landowners who supported the invading enemy of those who participated in the resistance <br> national. Only pro-japanese landowners were attacked by the party during the period of the war of <br> Anti -Japanese National Resistance. That is, the main contradiction of that stage of the Chinese Revolution had <br> modified in relation to the main contradiction of the previous step. The process was the same: the revolution <br> Chinese; but the main contradiction changed from one phase to another, from Agrarian to Nacional, both <br> part of the new democracy revolution. <br> Imperialism is the upper, last and particular stage of capitalism. Their particular traits are governed <br> by the sharpness of the fundamental contradiction of the capitalist process, which manifests itself in class relations <br> as the antagonistic contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie. This contradiction is universal for the whole <br> process, will exist until the complete disappearance of the bourgeoisie and other social classes, a task that <br> will travel, as has already shown the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the whole period of acute <br> Transition struggles to communism. However, in the course of the development of the capitalist process <br> at least three steps were configured: from its dawn, which emerges as a mode of production subjugated by the <br> Feudal production mode; of its “flowering” in the stage of free competition; and your agony, in the stage<br>imperialist. Throughout this long process, the proletariat and bourgeoisie contradiction followed as a contradiction <br> particular and fundamental of this process. Will follow in the transition period, socialism, but as a new <br> qualitatively distinct phenomenon, as the proletariat will pass the dominant aspect and the bourgeoisie aspect <br> dominated from contradiction. The experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and the formulations of the president <br> Mao, demonstrate that this contradiction follows as the main contradiction in the whole process of revolution <br> socialist until we reach all over communism. Becoming aware of this continuity is decisive to support <br> The dictatorship of the proletariat, to appeal to restoration attempts and transit the bright communism. Although <br> This particular contradiction of the process followed and continues as a fundamental contradiction until the extinction <br> complete of the social classes, in each of the stages of this process of matures a contradiction that <br> makes the main one. A new stage only arises in a particular process when a new <br> main contradiction that determines the new particular characteristics of this new stage. As seen in <br> example above the modification of the main contradiction and the emergence of new phases in the process of the <br> Chinese revolution. <br> There is full correspondence, therefore, between the law of contradiction established by the President Mao and the definition <br> contained in the political declaration of principles of LCI that contradiction between oppressed nations and <br> Imperialism corresponds to the main contradiction of the entire imperialist stage. Dialectically this <br> Delimitation is not only possible, as necessary. The fact that any of the other contradictions <br> fundamental can become, depending on the conditions, the main contradiction in the world, as in the case of <br> an interim world war, means that the imperialist stage is also subdivided into phases <br> qualitatively different. Here again we see ourselves with the dialectic between the Universal and the Private. <br> As well as taking class society as a process, we can characterize society <br> capitalist as a stage of this process, we can consider imperialism as a process whose <br> Different phases correspond to steps in their development. Thus each phase in the step <br> characterizes by a change in the main contradiction, but the mainly tends to return to the <br> main contradiction that marks the stage of the process. <br> The fundamental contradiction of a process, therefore, is that particular contradiction that distinguishes it from <br> Other qualitatively different processes (capitalism and feudalism, for example). But when taking the <br> stages of the same process, the fundamental contradiction will be the one that will continue to governing the process <br> as a whole, through the modification of the main contradiction in the different stages of it (free <br> competition and imperialism, for example). Every complex process is composed of numerous contradictions, <br> But what are the fundamental contradictions? Are those contradictions that conform the nature of the <br> process and its steps or phases of the step. Among the fundamental contradictions one will be main in the stage <br> in progress and the other secondary. <br><br><br> We have seen that, philosophically, it is correct to identify the fundamental contradictions in the world today, in the stage <br> imperialist. In addition, we also saw that among these fundamental contradictions, depending on <br> Circumstances, one will be the main contradiction; that this does not nullify the existence of a contradiction <br> fundamental, particular, of the process. On the contrary, this is the form of universal contradiction to manifest itself, <br> for the universal can only exist specifically in particular. At the same time, we seek to demonstrate how <br> each particular stage is also marked by a particular contradiction, or by the main contradiction of the <br> Step, that the change in this main contradiction determines the overcoming of phases in the same step. And by <br> end, it was seen that the existence of a main contradiction in the world does not correspond to that the contradiction <br> main in all countries is the same. <br> The difficulty in understanding this complex relationship lies in the apprehension and management of the dialectical relationship between <br> the universal and the particular, decisive element of the law of contradiction formulated at higher level by the <br> President Mao. However, philosophy is not enough to correctly identify what are the <br> Fundamental contradictions of the world today and of these what is the main contradiction of the imperialist stage. This <br> It is only possible, as the letter of 25 points highlights, from a “concrete analysis of the classes, <br> world economy and politics ”. This is what we will seek to do next. <br> 3.2- The economic and political aspect of the question <br> The immediate economic manifestation of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie, social classes <br> fundamental of the entire capitalist process, is presented brilliantly by Marx in his work<br>Salary, price and profit. In this work, the founder of the scientific ideology of the proletariat, demonstrates that the <br> immediate economic contradiction between the fundamental classes of capitalist society, was in opposition <br> Between the wage of the worker and profit of the bourgeois. In making this exhibition, directed to the direction of I International, <br> Marx had already fully formulated his added theory. Thus, it demonstrates in solid bases <br> scientific as the struggle to achieve the wage increase implied the immediate reduction of profit <br> capitalist. Thus refuted the erroneous understandings within the labor movement, which argued that <br> Every salary increase could be annulled by the subsequent increase in subsistence media prices. <br> Marx demonstrates that salary and profit composes two parts of the same unit: the new value added in <br> Productive process and therefore increasing salary implies reducing profit. At the same time, Marx <br> demonstrates in this same work, how the struggle of the proletariat cannot be summarized to a greater appreciation of the <br> Workforce, to a “fair wage”. Demonstrates that while there is wage labor, while the <br> bourgeoisie is the owner of the means of production, the proletariat will be a subjugated, exploited and <br> squeezed by competition with their own brothers through the jobs, mechanism through which <br> Capitalist class can impose the salary reduction and recovery of its profit. <br> In the capital and anti-dühring, Marx and Engels demonstrate that the economic contradiction of the background of the <br> Capitalist society is the one that opposes social production and private appropriation. This contradiction is not resolved, <br> nor momentarily, with the salary struggle, its resolution corresponds to the socialization of the means of <br> Production, a task that can only be fulfilled, as Marx demonstrates, through the dictatorship of the proletariat. A <br> immediate manifestation of this contradiction, however, occurs in the continuous effort of the capitalists to reduce <br> the value of the workforce at its minimum and, often below it, to increase the increase in <br> extraction of added value, which provides the bourgeoisie its faustic life and its gigantic accumulation of <br> wealth. The surplus value is, therefore, the immediate economic base of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie. <br> What, in turn, is the economic base of contradiction between oppressed nations and imperialism? As seen <br> Previously, when dealing with the maximum profit, it rests on three pillars: 1) obtaining a rate <br> higher value, as it suits it and it is possible to explore the nations proletariat <br> oppressed to a more extreme degree than in imperialist citadels; 2) The restriction of the profit of the bourgeoisie <br> not monopolistic, imposing a minimal profit; and 3) the suppression or appropriation by the financial capital of the <br> Land income of primary products of the oppressed nations. The struggle of the proletariat of these countries for <br> Better wages constitute the immediate, fair and necessary response against this overexploitation. Interest to <br> imperialism, therefore, the maximum violence, political control, the minimum of union freedom, to <br> impose a salary below the value of the workforce. The national bourgeoisie reacts to the restriction of its profit <br> claiming protective measures from the old state to the fragile, small and medium, national industry. Like yours <br> production is, as a rule, subjugated to monopolistic production, has economic and political conditions <br> very precarious to achieve these goals. <br><br><br> Agroexporter Latifundium, for receiving high performance for its production, maintains a stable alliance <br> with imperialism, although it is always threatened by an overproduction crisis and a low <br> widespread international prices of its monoculture, are at the mercy of the financial oligarchy <br> International. Regarding national riches, the oppressed nations struggle to ensure national control <br> of this production and for guaranteeing a price policy that minimally ensures the right to land income <br> capitalist. As the ruling classes of these states are Lacao of imperialism, in general, this struggle for <br> Land income is reduced to bargains by benefits, or by “modest indemnities”, as characterized Lenin. <br> The resolution of the contradiction between nation and imperialism, as well as the contradiction between bourgeoisie and <br> proletariat, cannot be merely economic; no consortium measure of the oppressed countries, or <br> import replacement, can solve this trend of subjugation, permanent overexploitation of the <br> proletariat of these countries, the restriction of the profit of the national bourgeoisie or the suppression of land income <br> of national resources. Only national liberation, the definitive achievement of political independence front <br> To imperialism, it can ensure the realization of these claims; And this political liberation is only possible to be<br>achieved through the prolonged popular war in a revolution of new uninterrupted democracy <br> socialism, which builds from the beginning, a joint dictatorship of the revolutionary classes as transit <br> to the dictatorship of the proletariat. <br> The economic base of the interim partnerist contradiction is, in the first term, the control of the as much as possible <br> all the surplus value produced worldwide. For this, it is necessary, the control of <br> colonies/semicolonies to monopolize the permanent overexploitation of these proletarians, thus restricting <br> The volume of proletarian masses exploited by the financial capital of rival powers. In addition, the control <br> of semicolonies to suppress the land income of primary products of these, thus reducing the costs <br> with constant capital allowing it to reach maximum profit rates. When controlling certain sources <br> of raw material, by establishing monopoly price on this primary production, thus can reduce the <br> Your favor of rival imperialist powers who are just buyers of these goods. <br> The form of resolution of this contradiction is the imperialist wars, which begin with aggression to nations <br> oppressed controlled by rival powers, until it reaches the point of direct confrontation between the <br> powers in their territories. This contradiction can only be eliminated with the drinking of the imperialism of <br> face of the earth, for while imperialism there will be the inevitability of the war and <br> interimperialists and, as an inseparable part of the search for financial capital by the maximum profit. <br> Any of these fundamental contradictions can become the main <br> development of other contradictions. However, in the imperialist stage which of these contradictions <br> mainly the dominant role among the others? From the economic point of view, stop responding to this <br> question needs us to depart from the particular form of survey of the added value in the imperialist stage that is the <br> Maximum profit. The main contradiction of the imperialist stage, therefore, is the one that determines the <br> development of other contradictions to achieve, maintain and dispute the added value produced in the <br> The world to achieve the maximum profit will be the main contradiction of the imperialist stage. <br> Analyzing this issue from an economic point of view, helps to shed light on exploration and <br> Production in the stage of monopolistic capitalism; to understand the role of social classes, in general, and the <br> Required relationship between imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, semi -feudal. <br> As the suppression of capitalist land income is a necessity for the maximum profit of capital <br> Financial, imperialism has always been interested in maintaining a feudal or semi -feudal monopoly of the earth. <br> This is the economic reason for the narrow ideological-political relationship between large landowners in the <br> countries overwhelmed with their mes in the imperialist powers. Either for food production, or for <br> Extraction of raw materials, the existence of large property in semicolonials is essential for the <br> Suppression of capitalist land income in the semicolonic. After all, it is much cheaper to financial capital <br> pay income to a small class of large parasitic owners, for the extraction of wealth <br> Natural from a country, than paying what the capitalist land income would be for an entire nation. When the <br> old state is the owner of these natural riches, in general, is content with the payment of royalties <br> on the part of the financial capital, which are always under what would be the land income rate <br> capitalist. The royalties paid by financial capital, either to the large owners or the old state <br> Bureaucratic, they are a semicolonial land income and not a capitalist land income. The difference <br><br><br> quantitative between the two is the added value retained by financial capital, which will compose its <br> Maximum profit. <br> The role that the exploration relations of imperialism with the oppressed nations is in the production of <br> maximum profit is similar to the exploitation of the people and poor masses of these countries by bureaucratic capitalism <br> and by semi -feudality. Bureaucratic capital is necessary to reproduce the peasant economy; because the <br> peasant produces for the domestic market in exchange for a small yield, which in no way <br> corresponds to the capitalist land income. Thus, peasant production even having a productivity <br> much lower than large mechanized production often provides a food product <br> cheaper. This is possible, not because small production is more efficient than the big one, but because <br> the subjugation of the peasantry and its permanently ruined production, because it was sold at prices below <br> of costs ensures these lower prices. In this way, bureaucratic capital indirectly explores the<br>peasantry, because the isolated peasant in his portion cannot face the capitalist domestic market <br> Monopolized and always is obliged to sell your production for the price they pay you. The yield that <br> Receives is just enough to reproduce its ruined economy. In turn, this ruined production only <br> It can be maintained under these conditions being surrounded by all sides by large property. If it was not <br> Thus, the peasant would seek better conditions to grow and prosper. In this way, it is the system <br> landowner that ensures peasant oppression, its miserable condition and the overexploitation in which <br> provides food to the domestic market without earning either income or profit, as was the case with the peasant <br> Irish analyzed by Marx. Yield, therefore, that earns these peasants, is not an income <br> Capitalist landlord, it is a semi -feudal land income. This is the first economic reason for why <br> Peasant production, although in constant ruin, is never completely eliminated in imperialism. <br> However, there is another economic reason for this phenomenon. The reproduction of the peasant economy <br> ruined by large landlord property, serves as a workforce reserve, always available <br> for the seasonal works of agriculture; but, in addition, the field in semicolonial countries exports <br> always, from time to time, waves of workers to the cities, obliged to subject themselves to the worst <br> exploration conditions in industry and service sectors. The reproduction of the peasant economy is fulfilled <br> thus a key role to constantly produce a relative overpopulation, which in turn is <br> essential for the other maximum profit factor: the permanent overexploitation of the working class. At the <br> Brazil, the heaviest works of the construction industry, as a rule are performed by <br> newly expert peasants from the countryside. If this peasant economy is liquidated, this source is exhausted <br> invaluable for workers to be overrexploited that in general constitutes the peasant regions of countries <br> oppressed. <br> Latifundium, due to its semi -feudal condition, is the social agent of imperialism that ensures the suppression of <br> capitalist land income that would fit the peasants, in the case of agricultural production, and that would be the nation, <br> In the case of natural riches looted by imperialism. Latifundium is essential for capitalism <br> bureaucratic because it ensures revenues with the export of agricultural and mineral goods, and, on the other hand, <br> ensures cheap production by the food peasant to the domestic market and the production of a <br> surplus overpopulation that migrates from the countryside to the city, thus ensuring the overexploitation of the class <br> worker in the semicolonian industries. In this way the landlord contributes both to the monopolistic profit <br> bureaucratic capital as for the maximum profit of financial capital; On the other hand, bureaucratic capital and <br> Finance capital ensures the landlord all military, political and legal security for the most <br> atrocious against peasants and original populations. Ensure the income of this class of parasites <br> Enemies of the people. This relationship of dependence, between large estates and bureaucratic capitalism; between capitalism <br> bureaucratic and imperialism, it is the basis of the exploration system that ensures the maximum profit <br> imperialist. <br> In turn, this alliance of reactionary classes, these three mountains (semi -feudality, imperialism and <br> bureaucratic capitalism), which weigh on the masses of the countryside and the city of the oppressed countries, <br> in this way the proletariat, peasants and national wealth, its last product <br> the endless mass of immigrants, which year after year reaches imperialist countries, to be <br> overexplored in all kinds of work. European industry would not survive without immigrant masses <br> Turks, Kurds, Poles, Arabs, Africans etc; the service sector would not work without the Indian masses, <br> From Bangladesh, Senegal, Vietnam, Ecuador, etc. Just as Yankee imperialism does not <br> It would survive one day without the masses of Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, etc., that everything produce in that country. O <br><br><br> bureaucratic capitalism, having by one of its foundations, the landlord, is responsible for the production and <br> export of this contingent essential for imperialist production. A proletariat harassed by <br> migratory policies, for the police persecution, which is forced to accept the conditions of overexploitation <br> in the metropolitan centers of the imperialist powers themselves. It is the third party of the first <br> World, as President Gonzalo well analyzed. <br> The monopoly price, studied in the previous topic, is another important economic element for <br> comprise the causes of the continuous reproduction of the laddown industry of the national bourgeoisie and the<br>ruined peasant economy in the colonial/semicolonial countries. Although with a level of productivity <br> much lower than that of large industry, as soon as the monopoly price of capital is established <br> Financial in a certain branch arises the opportunity for survival of the non-monopolistic economy. <br> With a much higher production cost, the small and medium production become viable when <br> The monopoly price arises as it allows them to earn a minimum profit. In Brazil, beans is one of <br> main food products of peasants and workers; Traditionally it was a commodity <br> produced by the peasants and was therefore sold at a very low market price, which benefited <br> The industrial bourgeoisie, as it implied a reduction in the value of the workforce. With pro- policies <br> Latifundium during Petista and Dilma's petista management (2003-2016), the peasant economy declined its <br> production. The lack of peasant beans in the market, caused a significant increase in the price of <br> Market of this merchandise, which was dominated by large latifundist production. The landlord, to <br> contrary to the peasant, can impose its market price, generating a 200% increase in the price <br> of this commodity. On the one hand, this impacted the masses of the population with increased cost of living and, for <br> another, allowed the return of peasant beans to the market, which with this new price was again viable for the <br> Peasantry, despite the low productivity. The monopoly price thus explains the survival of <br> domestic industry in cities, and the small and medium production in the field. <br> The maximum imperialist profit is explained, therefore, for this complex relationship between imperialism and capitalism <br> bureaucratic, between imperialist bourgeoisie and bureaucratic bourgeoisie and buyer, between imperialism and <br> Latifundium, between large estates and peasants in the colonial/semicolonial countries. Thus, they are under these conditions <br> individualist stage that the contradiction between social production and the appropriation develops <br> private, as well as its manifestation in the class relationship between proletariat and bourgeoisie, which cannot be <br> Explained only from itself, only from the immediate relationship between salary and added value. So much <br> Thus, that the emergence of imperialism determines the consolidation of the phenomenon of the working aristocracy in the <br> imperialist countries. In this way, colonial/semicolonial national oppression implies a modification in <br> Conditions of development of contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie in imperialist countries. <br> In turn, it is imperialist domination that ensures for its own benefit the existence of the monopoly <br> semi -feudal of land in the oppressed countries; This monopoly of the earth ensures the reproduction of an economy <br> rolling peasant production of basic and determining foods in the low salaries of the proletariat in <br> by providing fundamental goods for the reproduction of the workforce produced below the <br> cost price. Thus ensuring the reproduction of a gigantic industrial reserve army, which <br> miserable living conditions is the source of the constant export of surplus population to the large <br> urban centers. The mass of poor expelled from the countryside to the city by the semi -feudal monopoly of the earth <br> It ensures, in turn, the permanent overexploitation of the proletariat in colonial/semicolonial countries. <br> Overexploitation this is a source of values for the bribery of the working class in countries <br> imperialists. The semi -feudal monopoly of the earth, the craving of large cities in the oppressed countries and <br> The permanent overexploitation of the proletariat, pressures the export of huge proletarian contingents <br> for imperialist centers. The mass of immigrants in imperialist countries presses down the salary <br> of the workers of the metropolises corroborating to the deterioration of the working aristocracy. The imperialist bourgeoisie <br> it increasingly needs increased extraction of surplus value in its own territory, as it fights <br> Constantly against the law of tendency to profit rate, brilliantly discovered by Marx. <br> President Mao states that the main contradiction is that “whose existence and development <br> determines or influences the existence and development of other contradictions ”389. Economic analysis, <br> political and social of imperialism demonstrates that the main contradiction of this stage of capitalism is between <br> oppressed nations and imperialism that determines the others. Because as we have just seen it is national oppression <br> colonial/semicolonial, supported by the landlord, which conditions the overexploitation of the proletariat in the countries <br> oppressed and also in imperialist countries. In turn, it is the colonial/semicolonial national oppression and its <br><br><br> inseparable suppression of land income in these countries that ensures the maximum profit over profit<br>of rival power. Control of these sources of raw materials, the colonial/semicolonial national oppression, <br> also determines the interim contradiction, which comes down as Lenin establishes in the struggle for <br> Break of the world between a handful of powers. <br> It is therefore that the main contradiction of the imperialist time is between oppressed nations and imperialism. AND <br> This does not nullify the existence of the fundamental contradiction of the capitalist process and its manifestation in the <br> class relations between bourgeoisie and proletariat. Because it follows as a fundamental contradiction of the process, <br> even during the imperialist stage, after all, economically all the maximum profit appropriate for the powers <br> It is fundamentally conformed by the added value extracted from the proletariat. In addition, the maximum profit <br> also conforms to the suppression of land income of agricultural products and the extractive industry in <br> oppressed countries, which directly conducive to increased profit (by reducing constant capital costs) and <br> indirectly the increasing increase (when goods enter the consumption of the proletariat). A <br> main contradiction of the stage does not nullify the fundamental contradiction of the process, it is the dialectical relationship <br> Between universal and private, established masterfully by President Mao in the law of contradiction. <br> IV- Unite under Maoism! <br> “The celebration of this I International Conference and the founding of the new international organization are <br> of historical importance and great transcendence, they are an achievement of the international proletariat and <br> a clear blow to the offensive counterrevolutionary general of imperialism and world reaction, so <br> as against revisionism and all opportunism. If it took a big step to reunite and <br> overcome dispersion in MCI and opened a new stage of the struggle organized by the reconstitution of the <br> Communist international, under the command and guide of Maoism, a new stage that will be marked by the <br> development of new popular wars that will add to those already underway. ” <br> (Political and Principles Declaration, International Communist League) 390 <br> The preparation and realization of CIMU was guided by the consign of uniting under Maoism! A UOC (MLM) <br> took part of the fight of two lines at the international level in the preparations of CIMU only from the publication <br> of the basis of discussion because it refused to do so before, taking part in the divisionist meeting of January <br> 2020, convened by PCM (Italy). After intervening in the fight of two lines, they did not proceed to proceed <br> This struggle in the conference itself. In 2022, the two -line struggle turned around key philosophical issues <br> of Marxism. This year, with the publication of the UOC Magazine (MLM) of criticism of our party and LCI, and <br> with the two editions of the magazine Fight of Two Lines, directed by this organization and PCM (Italy), <br> made the political differences of these organizations more evident with those who participated in CIMU. <br> With this document, so far we seek to analyze the most important political differences, however if <br> It is necessary to reveal the true ideological background of these differences. <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) for many years argues that Maoism is a new, third and superior <br> Step of Marxism. However, when we analyze the application that make this stage of the ideology of <br> international proletariat in defining the political line for the world revolution and in its own country, <br> You can see how empty this proclamation becomes. UOC (MLM): 1st) denies the law of contradiction as the law <br> unique fundamental of matter; 2) denies the effectiveness of the Revolution of New Democracy in Colombia; 3) denies the <br> need for the national democratic stage as a preparation of the uninterrupted passage to the socialist revolution <br> in the oppressed countries; 4) denies the strategic importance of peasantry in the revolutions of countries <br> semicolonials; 5) denies the correction of the definition of fundamental contradictions in the world today, established <br> by the Chinese letter (proposition about the general line of the International Communist Movement); 6) in your <br> Balance of the proletariat's dictatorship experience in the twentieth century, concludes that “in practice, Kautsky won <br> The battle in both Russia and China ”391. We sincerely question the direction of UOC (MLM): which <br> of the contributions and developments of Maoism you use to formulate the political line of the revolution in <br> Your country? <br> UOC (MLM) in its political proselytism makes the defense of Maoism, that the ideology of the proletariat <br> international is “Marxism Leninism Maoism” and the importance of President Mao for the Revolution <br> Chinese, valuing the importance of the new democracy revolution and the city's siege strategy for <br> field in this experience. Also, it defends the importance of GRCP and the contributions of Maoism for the <br> Construction of socialism. However, to solve the present problems of the World Revolution and the <br><br><br> Colombian revolution, not part of the universal contributions and developments of Maoism. Thus treats the<br>President Mao's contributions as an ideology that was important in the past and perhaps is <br> necessary in the future. For the present adopt formulations foreign to the ideology of the international proletariat, <br> as the characterization of semicolonial countries as “oppressed capitalist countries”; Defends the existence <br> of a progressive tendency of imperialism; argues that the task of national liberation is resolved with the <br> Dictatorship of the proletariat; Defends the immediate collectivization of the peasant lands; And finally, it states that <br> nature of the revolution in India, the Philippines, Brazil, Bangladesh, as well as in Colombia, is <br> socialist, that is, that the bourgeois democratic revolution has already taken place in these countries through the trend <br> Progressive imperialism. And says that such conclusions are the result of a concrete analysis of the situation <br> concrete. This means that the Maoist parties of these countries who defend and apply the <br> Fundamental theories of Maoism are mechanistic transporters of the experience of the revolution <br> Chinese. It really believes it does an innovative analysis of the Colombian reality and the other oppressed countries, <br> when they are actually copying old Trotskyist “theories”, specifically the counterfeit TMD of <br> Gunder Frank, Rui Mauro Marini et Caterva. <br> In the ideological field there is no empty territory, where there is no Maoism Medra revisionism. Let's see which <br> They are the real ideological foundations of UOC (MLM). <br> 1- To assume Maoism is to relentlessly combat all the revisionism: the old, the <br> Modern Kruschovista-Thenguista-Hoxhist and the 21st century revisionist modalities <br> The direction of UOC (MLM) formulate that the result of the supposed “progressive tendency of imperialism” was <br> the emergence in the world arena of such “oppressed capitalist countries”, in which by work and grace of capital <br> Financial were “swept the modes of pre-capitalist production”. In the international magazine struggle of two <br> lines, it does not affirm what is the source of this formulation, but when seeking in materials published in <br> Spanish, it's easy to find it. Because there it openly says that it takes it from the “comrade Bob Avakian”, valuing <br> as well as this excerpt from the 1980 MRI statement proposed by the US PCR and the <br> Chile: <br> “There is an undeniable tendency that imperialism introduces important elements of relationships <br> capitalists in the countries that dominates. In some dependent countries this capitalist development <br> It achieved such importance that it would no longer be correct to characterize them as semi-feudal countries; he would be <br> better qualify them as predominantly capitalist countries, even if they can be found <br> however important traces of semi -feudal production and that they reflect themselves at the level of <br> superstructure." (PCR-EUA AND PCR-CHILE) 392 <br> The great forgery of this Avakianist formulation lies in the fact that in the imperialist stage the <br> Capitalist development occurs the same way than in the free competition stage. As <br> It was established by Lenin, imperialism is the reaction in every line. Imperialism in your search for profit <br> maximum capitalism in semicolonial countries supporting, retaining and reproducing relations <br> of land ownership and more late production and more reactionary political regimes. That is, by <br> means of export of capital engenders a type of capitalism that does not destroy pre-capitalist relations, <br> how had the revolutionary bourgeoisie of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, quite the opposite, given its character <br> reactionary as monopolistic capital, parasitic and decaying capital, and agonizing capital, <br> imperialist bourgeoisie is based on the rotten bases in force in these countries, its financial capital merges with <br> Capitals of feudal origin and other precapitalist forms and drives a bureaucratic capitalism. <br> Thus formulated Lenin about imperialism and thus deepened him the Mao. Classify countries <br> semicolonials as “predominantly capitalist” with only “semi -feudal traces in superstructure” <br> is to deny the Leninist and Maoist formulations about imperialism, is to deny fundamental theories of <br> Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. It is, finally, to apologize for imperialism, as if it were possible under its <br> mastery some kind of progress in social relations. <br> UOC (MLM) part of this Avakianist forgery to accentuate its trotskyist characteristics, although <br> 1980 Declaration speaks in dependent countries and not dependent capitalism, the category of the <br> Kruschovista-Brejnevista and TMD Trotskism revisionism. “Predominantly capitalist countries” <br> formulate the revisionist thesis of the existence of “oppressed capitalist countries”, in which the revolution would already be <br> immediately socialist. <br><br><br> Regarding the peasant problem, the direction of UOC (MLM) applies to Colombia the Avakianist deviations in<br>same sense. In the 1984 MRI statement, the avakianist smuggling of “virtual elimination appears <br> peasantry ”in imperialist countries; UOC (MLM), in turn, defends the virtual elimination of <br> peasantry in such "oppressed capitalist countries". States that: “In Colombia, it is a fact the decomposition <br> and differentiation of the peasantry between agricultural proletarians and bosses ”, that is, applying Avakianism in <br> analysis of your country, concludes that there are no longer peasants themselves in the field, only workers <br> agricultural and agrarian bourgeoisie. The peasantry, like semi -feudality, would be just a trace. <br> The first revisionist ideological foundation, with which the UOC (MLM) converges is, therefore, the <br> Avakianism. Their theses on the supposed progressive tendency of imperialism, the existence of such <br> oppressed capitalist countries, of complete differentiation (or virtual elimination) of peasantry in countries <br> Semicolonials, they all start from the fallacious Trotskyist-Avakianist formulations. The importance of these <br> Formulations are explicitly recognized by the UOC Board (MLM) in their Spanish publications: <br> “[The revolution in the oppressed countries] has been a problem faced by the communists since <br> Lenin's times; treated, resolved and developed masterfully by Mao TStung and by <br> Chinese communists; resumed with special emphasis by MRI since the documents presented by <br> their precursors in 1980, in the 1984 statement and several articles of the magazine a world <br> to win; highlighted by the comrades of the PCR (EEU) and especially the comrade Bob Avakian. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 393 <br> Evident, that Avakian does not continue the development of the great bosses of the proletariat about the <br> important problem of revolution in the oppressed countries. Avakian, starting from revisionist positions, <br> Small Burgers, notably Trotskyists, distorts and confuses the issue. Underestimate the importance of <br> contradiction between nations/people oppressed and imperialism and accuses comrades Stalin and President Mao de <br> nationalist errors. UOC (MLM) starts from these antimarxist conceptions and accentuates trends <br> Trotskyists of Avakianism. <br> Let's see now the direct convergence of UOC's (MLM) tergiversações with the Trotskyist formulations. A <br> UOC (MLM) in defending the supposed progressive tendency of imperialism, only repeats the analyzes of the <br> Sicophanta Trotsky and traitor of communism that considered the Japanese invasion to China as positive, because <br> it would lead to the increase of the proletariat in this country, thus creating the conditions for its revolution <br> permanent: <br> “If Japan drove to keep positions won for about ten years, that would mean, <br> above all, the intensive industrialization of northern China to serve the military interests of the <br> Japanese imperialism. New railways, mines, plants, mining and metallurgical companies and <br> cotton plantations emerged rapidly. The polarization of the Chinese nation would receive a boost <br> FEBRIL. New hundreds of thousands and millions of Chinese proletarians would mobilize in the shortest time <br> possible. On the other hand, the Chinese bourgeoisie would fall into an increasing dependence on capital <br> Japanese. It would be less capable than in the past of putting yourself in front of a national war, <br> both and a national revolution. Before the foreign aggressor would emerge the Chinese proletariat, <br> numerically stronger, socially strengthened, politically mature, intended to direct <br> Chinese village. ” (Trotsky) 394 <br> Trotsky, this inveterate antileninist, considered colonial enslavement as progressive. The direction of <br> UOC (MLM), following the same steps, considers imperialism capable of sweeping semi -feudality. O <br> Great Lenin points out that imperialism exacerbates the contradictions of capitalism as much as possible <br> that solves them. <br> In relation to the necessary revolutionary national stage of the Popular War in the semicolonial countries, the <br> ‘Maoist’ UOC (MLM) states in his program that: <br> “The content of the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement in this era and in capitalist countries <br> Oppressed, it is no longer democratic of liberation and becomes socialist. ” [UOC (MLM)] 395 <br> And still: <br><br><br> “The semicolonial problem is part of the problem of the proletarian revolution, is part of the problem of <br> dictatorship of the proletariat. ” [UOC (MLM)] 396 <br> What a difference there is between this position and the defended by Trotsky in his revisionist work “The Revolution <br> Permanent"? Compare: <br> “For the countries of retarding bourgeois development and, in particular, for colonial countries and <br> semicolonials, the theory of permanent revolution means that the true and complete solution of <br> their democratic and national-liberators are conceivable only through the dictatorship of the <br> proletariat, which assumes the direction of the oppressed nation and, first and foremost, its peasant masses. ” <br> (Trotsky) 397<br>Let's look at what the chief of the Chinese Revolution, President Mao, says on such thes <br> Democracy: <br> “We advocate for the theory of continuous development of revolution, but not by theory <br> Trotskyist of a permanent revolution. We are willing to achieve the triumph of <br> socialism, crossing all the necessary steps of the democratic republic. We oppose <br> Second, but we also oppose adventurerism and ultra-revolutionarity. ” (President <br> Mao) 398 <br> The Maoist UOC (MLM), as well as the renegade Trotsky, conceives the solution of the national issue in countries <br> oppressed through the immediate dictatorship of the proletariat or as part of it. This is the complete denial of <br> Leninist thesis of the revolutionary democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants and, even more, the thesis <br> Maoist of the joint dictatorship of revolutionary classes to carry out the socialist revolution in countries <br> oppressed. <br> In an article entitled We Are Trotskyists?, The direction of UOC (MLM), when answering negatively, <br> formulates that the defense of the immediate socialist revolution in Colombia would not be trotskism, because according to them, <br> “Trotskyism does not consist of denying the steps through which the revolution must be passed” 399. Trotskism is <br> composed of numerous lies and falsifications, among them, are the denial of the revolutionary role of <br> Campesinate directed by the proletariat in the Democratic Revolution, a decisive issue to advance to the revolution <br> socialist, proven by the experience of the proletarian revolution, the denial of the need for stages of <br> revolution, and the denial of the need for the joint dictatorship of the revolutionary classes in the countries <br> oppressed. Note: <br> “The Epigons Comintern began by canonizing to the entire East the formula of‘ dictatorship <br> Democratic of the proletariat and peasantry '. ” (Trotsky) 400 <br> AND: <br> “In the course of its development, the democratic revolution transforms directly into <br> Socialist Revolution, thus becoming a permanent revolution. ” (Trotsky) 401 <br> Like Trotsky accusing the IC of canonizing a formula for the Revolution in the East, UOC (MLM) accuses <br> Dogmatism LCI for stating that the New Democracy Revolution is valid for all countries <br> semicolonials. Just as Trotsky enhances in denial of the need for steps in the process <br> revolutionary in semicolonial countries; UOC (mlm) formulates in its program including: <br> “Whatever the particularities, the capitalist character of a society in the oppressed country <br> By imperialism, it requires an anti-imperialist movement, not in step the part. ” [UOC (MLM)] 402 <br> In fact, Trotskism is not limited to the denial of the stages of the revolution, but this is the apology of <br> imperialism, the denial of the effectiveness of the democratic revolution under the direction of the proletariat and the denial of <br> Peasant problem. All these elements are shared by Avakian and, even more explicitly, <br> by UOC (MLM). Let us now compare its formulation and that of antileninist Trotsky on the issue <br> Peasant. As already seen, in relation to the peasant problem, UOC (MLM) advocates the need to: <br><br><br> “(…) Teaching the peasants, who to save should be combined with the proletariat to fight <br> private property and convert property of its land into property and exploitation <br> collective ”. [UOC (MLM)] 403 <br> Trotsky, in turn, defends the same old anti -pampon program: <br> “If the representatives of the proletariat enter the government, not as hostage without power but as a strength <br> leader, then will settle the limit between the minimum and maximum, that is, they will include the <br> collectivism on the agenda ”. (Trotsky) 404 <br> The identity of UOC positions (MLM) with Trotskism is very large and cannot be “denied” <br> Vacant statement that Trotskism does not consist of denying the stages of the revolution. Of course, it's a much more <br> nefarious, but this denial of it is the most fundamental in its rotten theories of revolutionarity <br> Radical appearance breakfast and anti-proleary right-wing content. UOC (MLM), when abandoning the <br> contributions and developments of Maoism for the revolution in the semicolonial countries, part of the smuggling <br> Avakianistas to end at the Trotskyist swamp. Behind such a boomed antidogmatic view, comes <br> anticientific formulations such as the supposed progressive tendency of imperialism and end up doing <br> The defense of the Falaz Trotskyist “Permanent Revolution” in the semicolonial countries. <br> The second ideological foundation of the false political propositions of UOC (MLM), therefore, is Trotskism. <br> For UOC (MLM) the revolution of new democracy would be true in the past, but false to the <br> gift; while the “permanent revolution” would have been false in the past but true in the present. <br> UOC (mlm), it should exist this late Trotskism and truly assume Maoism. But, to our<br>Seeing, this will not be a simple task, as the trotskyist roots of their analysis are very deep. Your <br> convergence with this type of opportunism ranges since its political analysis of imperialism and <br> semicolonial countries, openly from Avakianism to flow into Trotskism, until its analysis <br> economic formations of the oppressed countries when it is covered in the so-called <br> “Marxist theory of dependence”. TMD was formulated in the 1960s/70, by Trotskyist academics <br> Latin Americans linked to ECLAC. The main exponent of this theory was Brazilian Ruy Mauro Marini, <br> which for many years was a teacher in Chile and Mexico. <br> This supposed “Marxist theory of dependence” was an attempt of Latin American Trotskyism of <br> Economically substantiates also the supposed theory of Trotsky's “permanent revolution”. Supporting <br> in Kruschov's revisionist positions and his fallacious and infamous “secret report”, this mud <br> counterrevolutionary lies and resentments thrown over the heroic and glorious experience of dictatorship <br> of the proletariat in the USSR and on the contributions of the comrade Stalin, Trotskism has rehearsed a resurgence to <br> international level in the late 1950s. After the Cuban Revolution, in 1959 and, especially after the <br> announcement by decree, in 1962, made by Castro, that the revolution had become socialist, the <br> Latin American Trotskism sought to update the Trotskyist “Permanent Revolution” defending the thesis <br> revisionist that for the oppressed countries the immediate socialist revolution would solve the tasks <br> democratic, without the need for the revolution of new democracy. Exactly quite the opposite of <br> historical experience of proletarian revolutions in the oppressed countries, an experience in which the revolution of <br> new democracy that advanced socialist tasks, in confiscating the landlord and the great local capital and <br> Foreigner, as President Mao demonstrated, on the new democracy and other works of his. <br> To economically substantiate this ideological-political position, Marini and his consorts formulated <br> a false theory of dependence that aims to nullify the importance of national democratic tasks of <br> proletarian revolution in semicolonial countries. Falsifying Marxism, Marini seeks to reduce contradictions <br> of semicolonial countries exclusively to the one who opposes proletariat and bourgeoisie, and summarize the oppression of <br> imperialism solely to the overexploitation of the proletariat, passing over the mechanisms of <br> suppression and appropriation of land income from primary production produced and exported by countries <br> oppressed. In addition, Marini denies the existence and political importance of the bourgeoisian average (national bourgeoisie) <br> in the revolutionary process in these countries. As already seen in this document, the positions of UOC (MLM) <br> They fully coincide with these formulations of the Trotskyist theory of dependence. Let's go now, still <br> that quickly, only the direct comparison between the economic formulations of UOC (MLM) and those of <br> Marini. <br><br><br> Both UOC (MLM) and Trotskyist Marini conceive imperialism as a mode of production <br> worldwide in which different economies would be “chained” or “integrated” in the same and only <br> process. Both UOC (MLM) and TMD theorists conclude that the result of this chain is <br> that the native bourgeoisie of the semicolonial countries become “partner” of the exploration regime <br> imperialist, even reaching the same profit rate as financial capital. Of the enormous inequality of <br> labor productivity in imperialist countries in relation to dependent countries. That is, from the high <br> mechanization and application of more cutting -edge technologies in the production processes of the first and the low <br> industrialization of the seconds; superior organic composition of imperialist capital and composition <br> inferior organic of local monopolistic capital, both conclude that there would be a mechanism for <br> “Compensate” this huge difference in productivity that would be the overexploitation of work in countries <br> oppressed. This overexploitation would have to be exclusively of the semicolonial bourgeoisie, because if it existed <br> Also in advanced countries, there could be no such compensation mechanism. Let's see how <br> Marini formulates the question: <br> “Let us recall, to avoid misconceptions, that it low in the profit rate in dependent countries, such as <br> counterpart of the elevation of its organic composition, it is compensated for the procedures of the <br> overexploitation of work, in addition to the peculiar circumstances that favor, in the economies <br> agrarian and miners, the high profitability of variable capital. ” (Marini) 405 <br> Similarly, for the direction of UOC (MLM) the supposed compensation that would allow the bourgeoisie <br> semicolonial reaching the same profit rate as financial capital is thus presented:<br>“The cheaping of the elements that form constant capital, that is, the depreciation of capital <br> existing or maintaining production without renewing machinery and facilities, <br> expressed especially in 'import replacement', guided by imperialists to countries <br> oppressed until the 1970s in the transfer of 'obsolete' machines from imperialist countries to <br> oppressed countries, where overexploitation compensated for the local bourgeoisie the profit rate <br> average capital. ” [UOC (MLM)] 406 <br> The exclusivity of the overexploitation of work, allegedly belonging to the bourgeoisie of countries <br> semicolonials, as a compensation mechanism is thus presented by Marini: <br> “(…) This bourgeoisie depends, for the development of an industry, a technology whose <br> Creation is private of these monopolies. Then, then, but the alternative to offer these <br> a society in the production process itself, arguing with the extraordinary <br> profit possibilities that the coercive containment of the working class wage level contributes <br> to create." (Marini) 407 <br> And even more explicitly by the direction of UOC (MLM): <br> “The reduction of salary under its value, that is, under the value of the workforce, has <br> proper name in the oppressed countries: overexploitation. ” [UOC (MLM)] 408 <br> No! The reduction of wages under its value, identified by Marx, is called overexploitation of the <br> proletariat in both imperialist and semicolonial countries. The origin of this mechanism does not <br> originated in the oppressed countries, on the contrary, it emerged along with its industry in the most capitalist country <br> of your time: England. <br> Both Marini and UOC (MLM), distort the content of overexploitation of work, as if it is <br> could only compensate for the brutal difference of productivity in imperialist countries and in countries <br> semicolonials. Falsifying the law discovered by Marx of the tendency to the profit rate, say a <br> supposed advantage of overexploitation of work in the face of mechanization, because according to them, the <br> overexploitation would allow to increase the most-value mass produced without the “danger” of reducing the rate of <br> profit. However, as Marx demonstrates in detail in The Capital, when two capitalists <br> competitors, produce under different conditions of machinery, the one that produces in the best conditions <br> will obtain extraordinary added value, as it produces goods in a working time less than the <br> socially necessary. Overexploitation of work can reduce this difference, but never compensate it, <br> Marx thus exemplifies the question: <br><br><br> “The English director of a cotton wiring in Oldenburg [Russia] states that the work lasts there <br> 5½ in the morning to 8 pm, including Saturdays, and that workers at this time with <br> English supervisors, do not produce as much as English workers in 10 hours, and with <br> German supervisors much less. The salary is much lower than in England, falling into many <br> 50%cases, but the number of workers in relation to machinery is much higher, in the proportion of <br> 5 to 3 in several sections. Redgrave gives detail and exact information on the factories <br> Russian cotton textiles. Provided him with data an English manager who recently was there <br> employee. In this Russian soil, so fertile in infamies of all species, are in full <br> Flowering the old horrors of the first phase of English factories. The directors of the factories <br> Russians are naturally English, since the native Russian capitalist does not give this kind of <br> activity. Despite the excessive, uninterrupted, day and night work, despite the miserable <br> salaries, Russian products only get their placement in the domestic market because <br> import from foreigners. ” (Marx) 409 <br> Although the daily workday in Russia is from 14:30, including on Saturday, which totals a journey <br> weekly 87 hours; While in England the daily journey was 10 hours and the 60 hours weekly. <br> Although salary in Russia is 50% lower than in England; Although the possible intensity is high, <br> for the Russian factory was led by English directors; Despite all this the Russian goods only <br> They were able to compete with the English because their importation was prohibited. This practical example of <br> Marx completely overthrows the theory of Marini and UOC (MLM) that the overexploitation of work can <br> compensate for the difference in productivity and thus provide extraordinary added value to <br> “Dependent bourgeoisie”. <br> Completely falsifying the foundations of Marxist political economy, both Marini and <br> UOC (MLM), seek to present the overexploitation of work as a magical mechanism that <br> It would make it possible to compensate for the difference in productivity and grow the mass of added value and the profit rate<br>of the buying and bureaucratic bourgeoisie of semicolonial countries in competition with the bourgeoisie of countries <br> imperialists: <br> “The three mechanisms already identified - intensification of work, the extension of the workday <br> and the expropriation of part of the work necessary to the worker to replace his workforce - <br> configure a mode of production founded exclusively on the greater exploitation of the worker <br> and not in the development of its productive capacity. (...) This allows you to decrease the composition- <br> capital value, which, added to the intensification of the degree of exploitation of work, makes it <br> simultaneously elevate the added and profit rates. ” (Marini) 410 <br> And its disciples of UOC (MLM): <br> “The considerable disproportion of variable capital within total capital makes the salary <br> below the middle level and therefore increases, both the mass of surplus value and the rate of <br> profit." [UOC (MLM)] 411 <br> The extraordinary added value obtained by the bourgeoisie of “underdeveloped” countries, thanks to the “secret” <br> overexploitation of the proletariat, would allow the local bourgeoisie to reach the same profit rate, the same rate of <br> accumulation of capital, and would thus allow these bourgeoisie to become exporters of capital, <br> Configuring what Marini calls subfirialism: <br> “What was placed was the imperialist expansion of Brazil, in Latin America, which corresponds to the <br> truth to an submirialism or an indirect extension of American imperialism (not <br> let us forget that the center of such an imperialism would be a Brazilian economy integrated with <br> North-American)." (Marini) 412 <br> For the direction of UOC (MLM) the bourgeoisie of the “oppressed capitalist countries”: <br> "(…) [Reached] a great accumulation of capital making it excessive too.” It cannot be <br> “Evading your true monopolistic character and imperialist aspirations.” [UOC (MLM)] 413 <br> By taking the Trotskyist theory of dependence, UOC (MLM) concludes that the overexploitation of the proletariat in <br> oppressed countries, a real phenomenon, would allow the semicolonial bourgeoisie to obtain a profit rate equal to the <br> Financial capital, to the point of becoming an exporter of excessive capital and thus submirialist. So much <br><br><br> Marini as UOC (MLM) summarize imperialist oppression to overexploitation of work, unaware of <br> thus the other factors of the maximum profit of financial capital: the suppression of land income and the restriction of <br> Non -monopolistic bourgeois profit. Simplify the complex picture of reality to a single contradiction <br> between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, denying the revolutionary role of the peasantry in particular and <br> Small bourgeoisie in general, as well as the height of the national bourgeoisie and national oppression: <br> “Imperialism has broken the national borders and has faced in the world arena classes against <br> class." [UOC (MLM)] 414 <br> AND: <br> “Nowadays the heaviest and most dark yoke about the work of society is financial capital, the <br> king of imperialist capital that extended through the ends of the world, rocking whole people and taking <br> with the cause of its existence, survival and development: the overexploitation of <br> proletariat." [UOC (MLM)] 415 <br> The cause of the existence of financial capital is not only explained by the overexploitation of the proletariat, but <br> Also due to the suppression of the land income of the oppressed nations, for the looting of their natural riches. <br> Clarify this is to deny the contradiction between oppressed nations and imperialism, to summarize the contradictions <br> Fundamentals of the world to one: from class against class, right to the taste of Trotskism. Or how <br> Marini: "The foundation of dependence is the overexploitation of work." This is a foundation but not the <br> single. What's more, it is not exclusive to the bourgeoisie of the oppressed countries; on the contrary, overexploitation <br> permanent proletariat in the oppressed nations, as Lenin demonstrates, is the source that will supply the profit <br> maximum of financial capital. This prevents the Lacaia bourgeoisie from the semicolonies to enjoy this condition <br> On the same proportion. This overexploitation, therefore, does not allow the compensation of the theorized profit rate <br> by Marini and repeated by UOC (MLM). It is part of the privileges of financial capital given to its nature and <br> imperialist condition. <br> Convergences between UOC (MLM) and Marini analyzes are so many that do not believe they are <br> Only a fortuitous coincidence. In this way, we can conclude that the Trotskyist theory of dependence is <br> A third ideological foundation of the false political conceptions of UOC (MLM). <br> In addition to these convergences, UOC (MLM) still approaches other revisionist variants. In your <br> Criticism of the international line of our party and LCI, the UOC (MLM) repeatedly accuses us of deviations <br> "Third Worlds". With this means that we are supporters of the rotten theory of Teng's “three worlds” <br> Siao-papa. Our party defended and defends the position on the basis of discussion, but is not<br>present in the political declaration and principles, that is, that the formulated by President Mao is correct <br> that “three worlds are outlined” and that this focus is opposite to the falsification of traitor Teng Siao-Ping. <br> As is known to everyone, in the 1950s and 1960s, President Mao presented this thesis in <br> which one drew attention to the contradictions within the imperialist field, between superpowers and <br> imperialist powers. President Mao's thesis pointed to the design of the following three worlds: <br> imperialist (first world) superpowers, imperialist powers (second world) and socialist countries <br> and oppressed countries (Third World). Teng Siao-Ping falsifies this formulation and presents in 1974 and 1977 the <br> his rotten “theory of the three worlds”, an revisionist international line that aimed to sabotage the world revolution and <br> demoralize maoism. In his fateful speech, at UN, in April 1974, Teng Siao-Ping presents <br> publicly for the first time your rotten theory: <br> “Considering from the changes in international relations, the world today consists of three <br> Parts, or three worlds, all interconnected and in contradiction with each other. The states <br> United and the Soviet Union are part of the first world. Developing countries in Asia, <br> Africa and Latin America and other regions are part of the Third World. Developed countries <br> Between these two make up the second world. (…) At the same time, all these countries <br> developed are in varying degrees controlled, threatened or intimidated by one or another <br> superpower. (…) In various degrees, all these countries [from the second world] have a desire to get rid of <br> of slavery or control and defend its national independence and the integrity of its sovereignty. ” <br> (Teng Siao-Ping) 416 <br><br><br> That is, for the renegade Teng there would be imperialist countries (first world), developed countries <br> but oppressed (second world) and developing countries (third world). UOC (MLM), as <br> We have seen, analyzes that the world is divided into imperialist countries, oppressed capitalist countries and countries <br> semi -feudal; although he brands against the third worldism ending up converging with the same categories <br> of the rotten theory of Teng's “three worlds”. Just like this, they conclude about the existence of a “second <br> World ”composed of countries with developed capitalism, although oppressed by imperialism. Or how <br> formulate in their criticism of our party and LCI: <br> “It is possible that there are countries that are neither imperialist nor semi -feudal and colonial, but <br> that are relatively late capitalist countries ”. [UOC (MLM)] 417 <br> This possibility of UOC (MLM), however unusual from an organization <br> Politics that define itself as Marxist-lenist-Maoist, it is nothing new, it has already been presented in 1974 <br> by the rotten revisionist Teng Siao-Ping. This convergence with tenguism, therefore, constitutes the fourth <br> Ideological foundation of the false political positions of UOC (MLM). <br> Finally, in relation to the philosophical issue, dealt with in the first part of this document, it is necessary to consider the <br> Emphasis that UOC (MLM) gives the Law of Denial of Denial. Reaching the height of concluding that the fact of this <br> law, supposedly, was discarded by Stalin and President Mao would be one of the causes of restoration <br> capitalist in the USSR and China. As we highlight in the first part of this document, UOC (MLM) in its <br> formulations on the denial of denial at no time marks the difference between the meaning of the <br> Marx use of the conciliatory position of Proudhon and Pachanda and the false interpretations of Dühring and <br> Avakian. We show how for Marx the denial of denial occurs as a complete suppression of <br> private property on the means of production and not as a combination of social property and <br> Private propriety. That is, the process of permanent revolution until communism aims to put an end to the <br> interdependence between social production and capitalist property, it aims at the division of this unit to the contrary <br> in two, the development of the new aspect in a new contradiction and the historical disappearance of the <br> Old appearance. UOC (MLM) by not demarcating this distinction between the denial of denial in Marx and between <br> revisionists, approach the philosophical conception sustained by the renegade Prachanda that takes the denial <br> of denial as the process in which two combine in one. <br> By abandoning Maoism, reducing this powerful sword of the international proletariat, the teachings <br> Past or future, without validity in the present, UOC (MLM) ends in poor company: Avakian, <br> Trotsky, Marini, Teng and Pachanda. Apply a nominal and formally violating theories <br> its fundamental and without unfurling all its revolutionary content, it is not possible to combat the <br> Revisionism consequently. UOC (MLM), by not applying the revolutionary content of Maoism to the<br>current and concrete analysis of concrete contradictions in the world and in its own country, ends up housing in <br> Fundamentals of their old revisionist theses for a long time defeated in MCI. Of these <br> erroneous conceptions, the most serious and rooted in their formulations, are Avakianistas and Trotskyists, well <br> as the economic foundation of the false Marxist theory of dependence, which seeks precisely, <br> to substantiate a supposed validity of the Trotskyist “Permanent Revolution” in Latin America and in the countries <br> semicolonials as a whole. <br> 2- Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and the Democratic Revolution <br> The problem of the relationship between the direction of the proletariat in the revolution by socialism and the revolution <br> Democratic is not a new issue for the international proletariat and MCI. On the contrary, it was present <br> since the founding of its scientific ideology with Marxism and remains in force, updated and <br> developed at the time of imperialism. In the course of the process of development of the ideology of <br> Proletariat, this question was the subject of important two -line struggles. Just as today it is again in <br> Field of Maoism. <br> In the manifesto of the Communist Party, Marx and Engels state that: “The German bourgeois revolution <br> It may be but the immediate prelude of a proletarian revolution ”418. In the balance of the defeat of the revolution <br> Democratic of 1848, Marx analyzes the difference between the breakfast position and the proletarian, in the course of <br> German revolution, concluding that: “While the breakfasts want to end the revolution the most <br><br><br> possible (...) our interests and our tasks are to make the permanent revolution until the <br> proletariat conquers state power. ”419 <br> This permanent revolution formulated by Marx, has nothing in common with the Trotskyist Mirage of <br> revolutions on the never performed paper that provides for the abandonment of democratic tasks, on the one hand, and the <br> Parliamentary cretinism, on the other*. Marx and Engels followed, throughout his life, defending the <br> Need to defend bourgeois democratic flags in the fight against semi -feudality in Germany, <br> even when these flags were abandoned by the bourgeoisie. Thus highlights Engels, in the years 1870: <br> “Therefore, it is in the interest of the workers to support the bourgeoisie in their struggle against all elements <br> reactionaries, as long as it remains faithful to itself. All gain that the bourgeoisie extracts from the reaction <br> It ends up benefiting the working class if this condition is fulfilled. (…) But what if the bourgeoisie is not <br> true to themselves and betray their own class interests, along with the principles, the <br> What would this imply? So there are two paths left for workers! Or boost the bourgeoisie <br> against your will and oblige it, as far as possible, to extend the suffrage, to grant freedom <br> press, association and assembly and thus create an arena for the proletariat, in which he can <br> move and organize yourself freely. This is what English workers have done since the bill <br> of reform of 1832 and the French workers since the July 1830 Revolution (…). Or, <br> alternatively, workers can withdraw entirely from the bourgeois movement and leave the <br> bourgeoisie to your own luck. This is what happened in England, France and Germany after failure <br> of the European workers' movement from 1848 to 1850. (…) this cannot happen when the <br> Working class is in good condition, as it would be the equivalent of total political abdication. ” <br> (Engels) 420 <br> In 1891, Engels, in his critique of the Erfurt program, also criticized German social democracy for <br> Do not unfurl the democratic claim by the Republic in Germany as opposed to the Prussian monarchy. <br> The relationship, therefore, between the proletarian revolution and the democratic revolution, unfurled in 1848, followed <br> as an important question for Marxism throughout the nineteenth century. In the first stage of the ideology of <br> international proletariat, the fight of two most important lines around this relationship was against the <br> Lasalist Small Burge Socialist Positions. Lassalle acted near Marx and Engels during the <br> Revolution of 1848 and remained close to Marxism until the late 1850s. <br> 1860, begins to defend openly opportunistic positions and shortly before his death in 1863 founded the <br> General Association of German Workers. The struggle against Lassalismo was of great importance in <br> development of the specific line of the revolution in Germany and is at the center of Marx's controversy with the <br> Social Democratic direction formulated in his genius critical work of Gotha's program. <br> Lassalle was a right -wing opportunist, who sought to cover up the content of his position, with phraseologies of <br> left. In this way, he advocated a pure social revolution, arguing that the proletariat abstained <br> of the democratic struggle of the bourgeoisie against the dominant feudal forces in the kingdom of Prussia. The essence<br>Directist of this position is explicit in the question of the forms of unification of Germany. Marx and Engels <br> argued that unification should occur through a democratic revolution, supported by the proletariat, <br> to crush the feudal reaction and the monarchy. Lassale, in turn, supported the reactionary unification route <br> German defending the prussian monarchy in a dynastic gerra against Austria. In the War Episode <br> Austro-Franco-Italian, Lassalle proposed that the “Mission of Prussia” would be to support Napoleon III in destruction <br> from Austria: <br> “Regardless of how you think about the form of this unity, if we think of it as a republic <br> German, as a German empire or, finally, as a strict federation of independent states <br> - All these questions can remain open at the moment. In any case, all these parts, if <br> have intelligence to understand each other, they must work together in the essential condition for each <br> *“The central consign of Stalinists, both in India and China, is still the democratic dictatorship of workers and <br> peasants. (…) The course of the historical process converted the 'democratic dictatorship' into a hollow fiction, and also <br> TRACK TRACK FOR THE PROTORIA. (…) Instead of giving the revolution an abstract democratic character and allow it <br> reach the dictatorship of the proletariat only after any kind of mystical or superstitious 'democratic dictatorship', <br> our strategies reject the central political consign of all revolutionary democratic mobilization, precisely <br> CONSITENT ASSEMBLY CONSIGN. (…) The Constituent Assembly, Ond and Formally the representatives of all the people <br> adjust their accounts with the past, but where in reality the different classes adjust reciprocal accounts, is the expression <br> widespread, natural and inevitable of the democratic tasks of the revolution, not only in the consciousness of the peasant masses that <br> arouse but also in the conscience of the working class itself. (…) Give the consign of the Constituent Assembly a <br> particularly deep revolutionary democratic content. ” (Trotsky, The Indian Revolution, Bold Our) <br><br><br> One of these cases: the annihilation of Austria. (…) Napoleon is about to do this work <br> preparatory to the constitution of the German unit. ” (LASSALLE) 421 <br> The Marxist position on the issue, supported by Engels in The Powder and the Rhine, pointed to converting the <br> Attack of the French Empire in a revolutionary national war that would lead to German unification on bases <br> democratic and republican. Lassalle hid his right -wing position with a leftist phraseology, <br> saying that in addition to the proletariat the rest of the German population would be a “reactionary mass”, and that the <br> National issue would be resolved by a dynastic war without the participation of the working class. Engels <br> describes this Lassalista dogma as follows: “They adopt the sound but historically false dictation <br> LASSALLIANO: In relation to the working class all other classes are just a reactionary mass. ”422 <br> Thus, like Trotskism, Lassalism had a directist essence covered by the leftist verbiage. <br> Years later, Lassalle's secret agreements with Bismarck were discovered, clearly revealing that <br> behind the discourse of abstracting from political and national issues, the position was essentially <br> that saw in the feudal aristocracy and absolutist monarchy a progressive tendency. Correspondence <br> Secret to Bismarck, Lassalle wrote that: <br> “[The workers] would be inclined, despite the republican convictions, (…) to see in the crown <br> natural bearer of a social dictatorship as opposed to the selfishness of bourgeois society, since <br> that the crown (…) decides to truly walk along the revolutionary and national path, and <br> convert from a monarchy of privileged layers, into a social monarchy and <br> revolutionary. ” (LASSALLE) 423 <br> Lassalle's positions caused important damage to the German proletariat. The lack of understanding <br> among the relationship of the proletarian revolution with the democratic revolution, widespread widespread in Germany, <br> seriously influenced the errors of the spaced left in the German revolution of 1919. Franz Mehring, one of the <br> exponents of the Spartaquista League, for example, evaluated that Lassallse's position regarding the issue <br> national was correct. Mehring evaluates this question as follows in 1918: “Once the <br> possibility of a bourgeois revolution, Lassalle realized correctly that German unification, until <br> where it was possible, it could only be the result of dynastic commotion ”424. <br> This assessment of Mehring was not restricted to a historical balance of the German revolution. She was <br> loaded with positive considerations about lasallism, particularly the convergence with the evaluation <br> about the existence of a reactionary mass. This position, for example, influenced the erroneous league line<br>Spartaquist on the issue of nationalities and the peasant issue, on which they opposed <br> self -determination of nations and the agrarian revolution as a way to the nationalization of the earth. These two <br> issues, in turn, were masterfully resolved by Lenin, precisely because he knew how to drink in <br> Ideological source of Marx and Engels and unleashed with Lassalle. Trotsky, on the contrary, expressed <br> his profound admiration for this small-bourgeois socialist: <br> “From the experiences of the Hungarian and German revolutions, Lassalle got the conclusion that, from there <br> Given, the revolution could only lean on the class struggle of the proletariat. ” (Trotsky) 425 <br> In the second stage of the ideology of the international proletariat, particularly in the course of the three revolutions <br> Russian: 1905, February and October 1917, Lenin established a big leap in this issue. Showed how <br> that the Russian Revolution, as a democratic revolution, would be done not with the Russian liberal bourgeoisie, but <br> against this bourgeoisie. However, not falling in the Lasasalista tale of pure social revolution, unfurled <br> need to raise the democratic flags of the end of monarchical absolutism, agrarian revolution and <br> self -determination of peoples as a step necessary for the socialist revolution. With the entrance to the Political Arena <br> of the peasantry, in the 1905 Revolution, it masterfully establishes the need for “dictatorship <br> revolutionary democratic workers and peasants ”. It also argues that the proletariat, <br> sustained in an armed force of its own, should dispute the direction of the Democratic Revolution, composing the <br> revolutionary government and aiming to bring the democratic revolution to the end to advance to socialism. <br> The February 1917 Revolution was the realization of this brilliant Bolshevik line. The monarchy was <br> knocked down, the Soviets of workers, soldiers and peasants were established, but this one, still with a lot of weight <br> of the Mecheviks positions did not take power, on the contrary, it began to support a provisional government <br> Hegemonized by the liberal bourgeoisie in composition with monarchical elements. Lenin showed, then, <br><br><br> that it should not be participated in this provisional government; but, yes, advance to the socialist revolution with the <br> Conquest all power for Soviets. And it is what is realized in October with the great revolution <br> Socialist, the party sends power at the insurrection of Petrograd and surrenders to the Soviets Congress of all <br> the Russia. For the first time in history, the dictatorship of the proletariat. <br> The Trotskyist Theory contrary to the democratic stage in the Russian Revolution, was formulated in 1905, taking <br> Loan the formulations of another opportunist, parvus. With the triumph of the socialist revolution in October, <br> Trotsky will seek to falsify the story, denying the importance of the February Democratic Revolution and <br> He shamelessly affirming that in October his rotten theory of permanent revolution was confirmed. <br> In his attempt to deform Leninism, Trotsky says Lenin late would have realized <br> Correction of his theory and that before April 1917, the Bolshevik tactic was identical to the Tactical Menshevik: <br> “It should be remembered that the official social democracy program at that time still remained <br> the same, both for the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, and that the practical tasks of the <br> Democratic Revolution were identical on both parties. ” (Trotsky) 426 <br> And still: <br> “In case of victory, this common revolt against the old regime should, according to Lenin, <br> Establishment of the 'democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasants'. This formula is today <br> repeated at the communist international as a general dogma, without being analyzed <br> Living historical experience of the last quarter of century. As if we were not actors and <br> Witnesses of the 1905 Revolution of the Revolution of February 1917 and, finally, the turnaround of <br> October! However, such a historical analysis is all the more necessary when the dictatorship regime <br> Democratic of the proletariat and peasants' never existed in reality. In 1905, Lenin <br> only spoke of a strategic hypothesis that should still be verified by the real course of the <br> classes. ” (Trotsky) 427 <br> Both counterfeit! The Bolshevik line was the winner, because the February Revolution was fulfilled as <br> Democratic Revolution. If they were not, there would be not enough forces to overthrow the monarchy; Moreover, <br> all the experience of the 1917 course was necessary to make the socialist revolution possible, which would have been <br> defeated if it were immediate. The revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasants existed <br> Yes, but did not take place in the provisional government, as the theses of 1905 predict, but in the Soviets since <br> February. However, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries refused to recognize him and preferred,<br>in its tibieza, support the bourgeoisie and English imperialism, strengthening the counterrevolutionary government <br> Provisional. And the struggle in this organ of power, the Soviets, was decisive, because there was the battle for the <br> conquest of the solid alliance between proletarians and peasants (and soldiers, which were in its vast majority <br> poor peasants). Alliance that begins with the general peasantry and in the course of the socialist revolution <br> It refers centrally on the poor peasantry. This is what demonstrates the precious balance of the two revolutions of <br> 1917, made by the great Lenin: <br> “At first arms given with 'all' the peasants against the monarchy, against the landlords, <br> Against the medieval (and, in this sense, the revolution remains bourgeois, bourgeois democratic). <br> Then, arms given with poor peasants, with the semi -proletariat, with all <br> exploited, against capitalism, including rich people, kulaks and speculators, and in this <br> Sense, the revolution becomes socialist. Want to raise an artificial china wall <br> between both revolutions, separate from each other that is not the degree of preparation of the <br> proletariat and the degree of its union with the poor peasants is the greatest tendency of the <br> Marxism, is to vulgarize it, to replace it with liberalism. ” (Lenin) 428 <br> Leninism has established in a new level the relationship between the democratic revolution and the revolution <br> socialist, demonstrated the need and possibility of transforming the first in the second, not through <br> of the artificial denial of the steps of this process, but from its realization in the facts. Lenin like this <br> summarize the question: <br> “The direct and immediate task of the revolution in Russia was a democratic bourgeois: ending the <br> remains of all the medieval, sweep them to the end, clean Russia of this barbarism, this shame, this <br> immense brake for every culture and progress in our country. (…) Both anarchists and the <br> Small Burger Democrats (that is, the mensheviks and the instarists as Russian representatives <br><br><br> of this international social type) said and say an incredible amount of confusing things about the <br> Existing relationship between the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution (that is, proletarian). <br> (Lenin) ”429 <br> And still: <br> “However, in order to consolidate to the peoples of Russia the achievements of the Democratic Revolution <br> Bourgeois, we should go further and so did. We solved the problems of the revolution <br> bourgeois democratic in the course of the passing, passing as a 'accessory product' of our work <br> main and true, of our proletarian, socialist revolutionary work. (…)  To the <br> bourgeois democratic transformations - we have said and we have demonstrated with facts - are a <br> Accessory product of the proletarian revolution, that is, socialist. ” (Lenin) 430 <br> How the great Stalin finishes: “(...) the idea of the transformation of the democratic-bourgeois revolution <br> Socialist Revolution, expressed by Lenin as early as 1905, is one of the ways in which the theory of <br> Marx's permanent revolution ”431. <br> In the third stage of development of Marxism, Maoism, the question acquires its classical form and <br> higher. President Mao states that the transformation of the Democratic Revolution into Revolution <br> socialist corresponds to the uninterrupted passage of the new democracy stage to the socialist stage of <br> Revolution in semicolonial and semi -feudal countries. Shows how in the course of the democratic revolution <br> perform socialist tasks, notably the confiscation of the large local and foreign capital (imperialism), their <br> nationalization in the hands of the new revolutionary state, that is, the complete socialization of the means of <br> production controlled by imperialism and the great local bourgeoisie. In addition, it formulates that in the course of <br> revolution of new democracy comes a new form of dictatorship, the joint dictatorship of the classes <br> revolutionary, indispensable transient form for the proletarian revolution in semicolonial countries, and with <br> the conquest of power across the country concludes the democratic stage, transforming the class of class <br> of the state in the dictatorship of the proletariat: <br> “This form [the dictatorship of the proletariat], however, cannot be adopted by a certain <br> historical period, in the revolution of the colonial and semicolonial countries. Consequently, in all <br> These countries, the revolution can only adopt a third form of state in the said period: the Republic of <br> New democracy. This is the form corresponding to a particular historical period and therefore is <br> a form of transition, but mandatory and necessary. ” (President Mao) 432 <br> Note that it is the President Mao who establishes the universality of the revolution of new democracy in <br> colonial and semicolone countries; and not in such semi -feudal countries as the UOC (MLM) falsifies, doing <br> Reborn the Trotskyist “Permanent Revolution” with “Maoist” seal. This universality is neither work of <br> President Gonzalo, neither of LCI's “dogmatism”, is the purest Maoism.<br>Once again, in the history of MCI, the question of the relationship between the proletarian revolution and the revolution <br> Democratic is put in the order of the day, dividing the fields, now, with whom denying fundamental theory <br> of Maoism it is maleist. In this sense we consider it very correct, the <br> observations on this issue raised by the PCI (m) in its greeting to the conformation of the party <br> Revolutionary communist of Nepal: <br> “Our party believes that only by performing the tasks of new democracy, in struggle <br> cross in the path of the prolonged popular war against imperialism, buying capitalism <br> bureaucratic and feudalism, at the base and superstructure, it is possible to successfully advance to <br> achieve new democracy and genuine popular democracy in semicolonial systems and <br> semi -feudal like Nepal and India. ” [PCI (M)] 433 <br> We evaluate how very correct this point made by the PCI (m), because it goes to the political issue <br> Central in the current fight of two lines in MCI: the problem of the effectiveness of the new democracy revolution. O <br> ideological foundation of this question is the recognition that the theory of the revolution of new democracy, <br> that came from the Leninist theses of the Revolution in the colonial/semicolonial countries, it is one of the main <br> Marxism developments achieved by President Mao in the course of the Chinese Revolution. This one <br> problem, therefore, is related to the question of the definition of Maoism, what is the universal content <br> President Mao's contributions, of being the new democracy revolution a specificity for the revolution <br><br><br> Chinese or to be a fundamental universal contribution of Maoism to the revolution of the semicolonial countries, the <br> what are the vast majority of countries in the world and whose populations correspond to the overwhelming majority of <br> Popular masses of the earth. <br> In his critique of the CIMU process, on which there is already a response from LCI434 itself, PCI (m), when dealing <br> of the development of the ideology of the international proletariat, it points out that: “Thought Mao Tsetung <br> (…) It was established as a new and superior stage in the development of proletarian ideology in <br> time of the IX Congress of the CCP. ”435 Then he points out that he was President Gonzalo“ the first to <br> formulate Maoism as the third, new and superior stage of Marxism ”. We agree with the PCI (m) of <br> that the IX Congress of the CCP had great historical importance for the establishment of Maoism. In this <br> Congress on the left consolidates the logos achieved in the course of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the <br> reestablishment at a higher level the definition adopted in the VII Congress, of 1945, in which it was defined that <br> The CCP was guided by "Marxism-Leninism and the ideas of Mao Tsetung." Definition that had been <br> Repealed by the right in 1956 at the VIII Party Congress. <br> The definitions of the IX Congress, highlighted by the PCI (m), for example, advances in various issues such as the <br> establishment of the contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie as the main contradiction, in the internal level, <br> of socialist construction; of the defense of GRCP, the need for the struggle of two lines for development and <br> forge of the Communist Party. However, it does not emphasize, for example, how it is explicit in President Mao, <br> In about the new democracy, the universality of the new democracy revolution for countries <br> semicolonials. Therefore, the definition of the Maoism made by President Gonzalo in 1988 in the course of war <br> Popular in Peru, it is not restricted to appointing the development of the ideology of a new stage. The main <br> President Gonzalo's contribution to MCI was the definition of the content of this new, third and higher stage <br> which is Maoism. <br> This is a profound ideological question on which important political errors may take place. As if <br> explicit in the formulations of UOC (MLM), which proclaims, for example, that Maoism is a third step, <br> but it is against the universality of the new democracy revolution to the semicolonial countries. A <br> Definition of Maoism, established by President Gonzalo, leaves no room for deviations like this, because <br> He establishes that Maoism is a leap in the three constitutive parts of Marxism, as unity, because the <br> President Mao in Marxist philosophy established the law of contradiction as the only fundamental; in the economy <br> politics gave great development to socialist construction and sat the foundations for the theory of capitalism <br> bureaucratic; and in scientific socialism resolved the question of the revolution of new democracy, the great <br> Proletarian cultural revolution and established the theory of prolonged popular war. <br> The delimitation of the universal aspect, in each of the stages of the ideology of the international proletariat, is not <br> A simple question. Highlight the universality in the theoretical and practical work of Marx, Lenin and Presidente Mao <br> It corresponds precisely to the respective definition of what Marxism, Leninism and Maoism is. The definition<br>of each of these stages of the formulation and development of the ideology of the international proletariat <br> corresponded precisely the clear delimitation of its universality, as well as the complete exposure of each <br> one of them as a doctrine. The definition, therefore, encompasses a synthesis, but is not reduced to it. <br> In the current fight of two lines in MCI, starting from the formulations about the thought Mao Tsetung made in the IX <br> CCP Congress seems to us insufficient. After all, to say how UOC (MLM) does that the new revolution <br> democracy is not valid for all semicolonial countries is to relegate Maoism to the experience of the revolution <br> Chinese, is therefore reduced to the condition of guide thinking and not a new stage in ideology. This is it <br> which makes UOC (MLM), for example, when comparing the 1980 and 1984 MRI statements: <br> “[In the 1980 Declaration] it was accepted since in some dependent countries capitalism was <br> a good development and that these were no longer semi-feudal (…). In the MRI Declaration ’ <br> (1984), it is back in relation to the previous point of view to generalize: ‘Still in countries <br> predominantly capitalist oppressed (…) it is generally necessary that the revolution <br> go through an anti-imperialist democratic stage before you can start the socialist revolution. ’ <br> In this way it took a step back, because the concrete analysis of the concrete situation, the living soul of the <br> Marxism, is replaced by mechanism, which intends to bring the conditions of China of 1938 <br> for today's conditions, as if capitalism had been detained, as if time had <br> frozen." [UOC (MLM)] 436 <br><br><br> For UOC (MLM), rigor, the revolution of new democracy was only valid in China from the 1930s. Today, today, <br> It would only be valid in such “semi -feudal countries,” which no one knows for sure what they would be. For Marxism- <br> Leninism-Maoism, from the Communist Party manifesto to the latest works of President Mao, the <br> Relationship between the proletarian revolution and the democratic revolution has always been a matter of paramount importance. <br> The revolution of new uninterrupted democracy to socialism is an inseparable part of the proletarian revolution <br> worldwide. To deny the validity of the new democracy revolution is to fall into the most rotten revisionism. <br> 3- President Gonzalo generalizes and develops the Maoist Theory of Capitalism <br> bureaucratic <br> In defining Maoism as new, third and superior stage of Marxism, President Gonzalo underlies <br> the universality of the new democracy revolution, for all colonial and semicolonial countries in the <br> World, in the generalization and development of the Maoist Theory of Bureaucratic Capitalism. THE DEFENSE OF THEORY <br> maoist of bureaucratic capitalism was done quite properly by the PCC-FR, in 2022, <br> Important document response to the Communist Workers Union (UOC) pronouncement on the proposal <br> of the Coordinating Committee for the Unified Maoist International Conference (CIMU). How this is a <br> essential question to defend the effectiveness of the New Democracy Revolution, as an indispensable part of the <br> World proletarian revolution, nowadays, we will address, even if passing through, this decisive contribution of the <br> President Gonzalo to the ideology of the international proletariat. <br> Taking Maoism as a unit, President Gonzalo summarizes and applies the theory of capitalism <br> bureaucratic formulated by President Mao to Peruvian reality, developing it in numerous aspects and the <br> Generalizing to the conditions of all the oppressed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America. O <br> bureaucratic capitalism is part of the world imperialist system and the formulation of his theory by the president <br> Mao and his robust development by President Gonzalo is a continuation of the imperialism theory of <br> Lenin and D'O Capital of Marx and Engels. <br> Bureaucratic capitalism is defined by President Gonzalo as “the capitalism that generates imperialism <br> in late countries, tied to feudality that is lame and subjected to imperialism that is the last phase of the <br> capitalism, which serves the majorities but the imperialists, the great bourgeoisie and the landlords ”and, <br> From President Mao, synthesizes its basic characteristics: <br> “1) that bureaucratic capitalism is capitalism that imperialism develops in countries <br> late, which comprises the capitals of the large landowners, the great bankers and the tycoons <br> the great bourgeoisie; 2) Explains on the proletariat, peasantry and the small bourgeoisie <br> and restricts the middle bourgeoisie; 3) It crosses a process by which bureaucratic capitalism is <br> combines with state power and owe state monopolistic capitalism, buyer and feudal, <br> deriving at first that develops as a large non -state monopolistic capital and <br> second, when it suits state power, it develops as monopolistic capitalism <br> state-owned; 4) Mature the conditions for the Democratic Revolution upon reaching the apex of its<br>development; and 5) confiscating bureaucratic capitalism is key to cable the revolution <br> Democratic and decisive to pass to the Socialist Revolution. ”(Communist Party of Peru-PCP) 437 <br> Therefore, bureaucratic capitalism is diametrically opposed to national conformation, preventing liberation <br> productive forces, exploring the working classes of the city and the countryside and the small bourgeoisie, <br> restricting the average bourgeoisie and oppressing all the people and materializes the nation's subjugation, serving <br> imperialism to control the economic process, whether in colonial or semicolonial countries; and, tied <br> to the landlord, it maintains the lame forms of semi -feudal, feudal and other exploration relations <br> more delayed, perpetuated in society through the evolution of their forms, whether by state roads and <br> non-state, associative or non-associative or mixed forms of them. Thus it leaves with all <br> revisionist theses, casters, guevarists, trotskyists and others of “dependent capitalism” that amino <br> imperialist domination and the evolution of feudal forms to now change the character of revolution in countries <br> dominated by predicting “socialist revolution already”, sometimes they set aside their revolutionary phraseology and pass <br> openly to defend capitulation and pacifist reformism to integrate with the old state as <br> “Cold accumulation for the socialist revolution”. In fact, traffic with the interests of the popular masses, <br><br><br> set up in your movement through opportunistic organizations, electoralism and cretinism <br> Parliamentary, in the conquest of “proficient places” in the structure of the old state. <br> In the study of Peruvian society and its economic and social formation, President Gonzalo founded the <br> Three moments of the process of bureaucratic capitalism in which it is 1) begins and develops, 2) deepens and <br> 3) goes into general crisis; process whose course takes place in cycles with gradients of “transitory recoveries, <br> but each new cycle starts from a lower point than the previous one. ” <br> President Gonzalo planting that the great bourgeoisie is divided into two fractions, the bourgeoisie buying and <br> The bureaucratic bourgeoisie: the first is older and more intermediate in the export processes, if <br> Develops mainly in banking and commercial branches and expresses itself as particular capital; Already the fraction <br> bureaucratic, appears when monopolistic capital merges with the state, being its main lever, and <br> concentrates mainly in industrial branches. Such differentiation is key, as it arms the proletariat against the <br> tale of the mermaid of the opportunistic “fronts” that argues to be towed one or another fraction of the great <br> bourgeoisie in its Pugna and collusion relationship for the Management of the Old State. <br> Studying the process and conditions under which bureaucratic capitalism is located is a decisive task to define <br> the character of the revolution in the countries oppressed as a revolution of new uninterrupted democracy to socialism, <br> whose content is agrarian, antiphaudal and anti-imperialist and the targets are the three mountains that oppress the people and <br> The nation: imperialism, feudality and bureaucratic capitalism. Such characteristics correspond to <br> Fundamental contradictions that are managed in these societies: contradiction between nation and imperialism; <br> contradiction between people and bureaucratic capitalism, as a broader expression of the contradiction between <br> proletariat and bourgeoisie, in the oppressed countries; and the contradiction masses-feudality, as an expression of the <br> Contradiction between mainly poor peasantry and landlord system. The first and last can come to <br> be mainly according to the phases of the revolution and modify their expressions in their course, but in general, it is the <br> contradiction masses-feudality the main when there is no military invasion of superpower or power <br> imperialist, being resolved through the agrarian revolution and, when the military invasion occurs <br> imperialist, the main nation-imperialism contradiction passes, whose resolution occurs through <br> National or anti-imperialist liberation revolution, as National Liberation War. The second <br> proletariat and bourgeoisie contradiction, which manifests as a contradiction between people and bureaucratic capitalism, <br> In turn, it changes and becomes main in the uninterrupted passage of the new democracy revolution <br> triumphant with the destruction of all semi -feudality and national liberation to the socialist revolution, guaranteed <br> by the confiscation of all bureaucratic capital and destruction of bureaucratic capitalism. <br> By taking the study of bureaucratic capitalism, President Gonzalo teaches how to pay close attention not only to <br> Economic base, but also in the ideological, political, legal and cultural superstructure; See semi -feudality <br> in its complete expression throughout society, from the base in the concentration and monopoly of the property of the <br> land, in which the servant and semi -wide relations are raised, even in gamonalism, which expresses the hegemony of<br>large semi -feudal property in politics and state mechanism, a factor against which <br> spearhead the agrarian revolution; Still, it draws attention to the political aspect of bureaucratic capitalism, which <br> rotten and sick is born and while perpetuating, the objective conditions for <br> development and triumph of the revolution. <br> The generalization and development of the theory of bureaucratic capitalism is, therefore, a great contribution of <br> Universal Validity of President Gonzalo; corresponds to a development of Marxist political economy <br> indispensable for the reasoning of the new democracy revolution in all countries <br> colonial and semicolonials in the world today. In this document, when we study the operation of income <br> land of the peasants and colonial and semicolonial countries, in the imperialist phase of development <br> capitalist, we are just adding some economic elements to this great contribution established <br> by President Gonzalo. <br> 4- Two fields were turned off, the dividing line is the effectiveness of the New Revolution <br> Democracy for the vast majority of countries and the vast majority of the population of the earth <br> The fight of two lines started last year around the base of discussion, published by the then CCIMU, <br> as preparation of the Unified-Cimu International International Conference, as the product of a long <br><br><br> process of struggles and efforts to overcome the dispersion of forces in MCI and its unit, mobilized how there is <br> much did not see the parties and Maoist organizations in a frank and direct debate, indispensable for <br> boost the ongoing process. Initially, the divergences focused on philosophical issues and, in <br> around President Gonzalo's universal validity contributions. The realization of CIMU corresponded to <br> Continuity of this struggle of two lines between the parties and Marxist-Leninist-Maoist organizations <br> LCI founders and its result, the political declaration and principles and as to the organic the Constitution <br> of a management committee, the sovereign body to the International Conference and the Council of Representatives <br> conforming by parties and member organizations. The continuity of the two -line struggle after the Foundation <br> from LCI, particularly with the UOC document (MLM), published in January 2023, and the two editions <br> from the Journal Fight of Dois Lines, published by this organization and PCM Italy, served to clarify <br> that the divergences with the LCI presented in them are not directly in the question of the contributions of the <br> President Gonzalo, but around Maoism's own fundamental theories, particularly <br> Question of the Revolution of New Democracy, the importance of peasantry in the revolution <br> World proletarian, the necessary relationship between imperialism and semi -feudality and the weight of the contradiction between <br> oppressed nations and imperialism. <br> We already knew the position of the UOC (MLM) of denial of the underlying semi -feudality in countries <br> SEMICOLONIAIS and its denial of the effectiveness of the New Democracy Revolution in the world today. However, <br> as a result of the development of the struggle of two lines in MCI, with the publication of the magazine <br> Two lines, No. 2, we learn that this position is also shared by PCM Italy, which <br> in his criticism of LCI states: <br> “A dogmatic appreciation on the 'semi -feudal' feature of all oppressed countries, <br> while some comrades of some of these countries reject this dogmatic appreciation, on the basis <br> of their own revolutionary experiences and analysis (such as Colombia Os <br> comrades of UOC (mlm); in other countries such as Tunisia, Iran and Nepal, some comrades are <br> advancing in this direction). ” (PCM Italy) 438 <br> According to PCM Italy there is no semi -feudality in Colombia, Tunisia, Iran, nor in Nepal. I.e, <br> For these semi -feudality does not subsist in any country in the world! Conclude this in the name of <br> antidogmatism. However, they only repeat, with the same words, the theses of Bob Avakian <br> presented to the 1980 Conference, let's see: <br> “(…) It is necessary to do a concrete analysis in each country, and to avoid mechanistic trends to <br> respect, it is a general principle that the level of revolutionary activity in the field in development <br> of the revolutionary movement is directly linked to the relative quantitative importance of <br> peasantry and to what extent there are still pre-capitalist relations in the countryside. ” (PCR-EUA E <br> PCR-Chile) 439 <br> The same cacarejo as ignorant about the peasant issue, of types that never put their foot outside the <br> large cities and post themselves to say that there is no longer semi -feudality in semicolonial countries. Orphans of <br> Avakian who join the Ratzanas of Peru's Lod Ryc, who repeat the same argument by saying that <br> There is no more semi -feudality in the Andes and therefore the revolution there would be immediately socialist. Such<br>which TKP-ML and MKP capitulators, which reject the peasantry as the main force of <br> Revolution of new democracy in Turkey as a justification for the abandonment and betrayal of the popular war. <br> The editors of the Journal of the Journal of Two Lines inherit the worst existed in MRI, both in relation to the <br> Avakianist-Trotskyist content of his position, regarding the methods of the relationships between parties and <br> Organizations. On the one hand, they censor a huge part of the PCI document (m), they blatantly cut 6 <br> 15 pages and call it "a small mistake." And cut precisely the excerpts in which the PCI (m) <br> defends the weight of contradiction between nation/oppressed peoples and imperialism, and the siege of the city by the countryside <br> in the prolonged popular war. On the other hand, they do not publish the dozens of pages of the UOC article (MLM), <br> in which the revolution in India, Philippines and Brazil would be suggested to be immediately socialist. No <br> publish the excerpts in which they argue that capitalism is developing in the field of these countries and <br> Sweeping semi -feudality: <br> “Briefly, capitalist production in agriculture is mainly realized for exchange and <br> using salaried work. Whatever the late forms of exploration or <br><br><br> land lease, can only reduce the speed of the capitalist transformation of agriculture, but <br> cannot stop it. Lenin showed this very clearly in the case of Russia and can also be seen <br> In the context of other countries today, such as the case of India or Brazil. ” [UOC (MLM)] 440 <br> UOC (MLM) transplants Lenin's analyzes on the development of capitalism in the field of Russia, <br> made at the time of free competition capitalism for India and Brazil at the time of imperialism; <br> To conclude that such as here, the capitalist relations of production would sweep semi -feudal relations. O <br> that should be swept away, is the nonsense Trotskyist thesis of UOC (MLM) of progressive tendency <br> imperialism. As for semi -feudality in the field in India and Brazil, only the prolonged popular war <br> can sweep your relationships. And this is our commitment and concrete practice. <br> The current fight of two lines in MCI, which began in 2022, around the realization of CIMU and the founding of the <br> LCI, patent the demarcation line between Maoism and Revisionism (in its old and current <br> modalities). Maoists hold clearly and bluntly that the main contradiction in the world <br> Today is the one that opposes nations and oppressed peoples against imperialism. The Heroic National Resistance <br> Palestine, the enormous support manifested by large masses around the world, thoroughly confirm this <br> Truth defended by the Maoists. The only way to resolve this contradiction is the new revolution <br> Democracy, uninterrupted to socialism, through the popular war directed by genuine parties <br> Communists. Therefore, it constitutes a clear demarcation line between maoism and revisionism the recognition of <br> Revolution of the Revolution of New Democracy for all colonial and semicolonial countries in the world. To deny <br> This is the truth to fall into the most village revisionism, it is to abandon the revolutionary path in the oppressed countries. <br> Communists from around the world, in addition to recognizing this validity, must assume that the revolution of <br> New democracy is the main force of the world proletarian revolution, because it encompasses most countries and <br> The overwhelming majority of the popular masses in the world. The international communist movement encompasses two <br> large currents: the international proletarian movement and the national liberation movement, and the <br> First is the direction and the second the base. Contrary to what Avakianism and other revisionists argue, the <br> international proletarian movement is not only present in imperialist countries, but in all <br> countries of the world. We are in the age of imperialism and the proletarian revolution, and the communist parties in <br> Each country constitute the avant -garde detachment of the proletariat whose main objective is the achievement of <br> Political power through the socialist revolution in imperialist countries and the new democracy revolution <br> in the colonial and semicolonial countries. The direction of the international proletarian movement on the <br> national liberation materializes in each country oppressed solely through the new revolution <br> Democracy through the prolonged popular war. The more the new revolutions advance <br> Democracy in the oppressed countries, the better conditions for the advancement of socialist revolutions in <br> imperialist countries. <br> Unfurl and defend the effectiveness of the new democracy revolution and especially apply it through <br> Revolutionary concrete practice is a decisive line of demarcation between maoism and revisionism. The direction <br> of UOC (MLM) for years openly oppose this issue and without rectifying this serious revisioner deviation<br>It will overcome its isolation from the masses. Will only be sinked to the swamp of electoralism, practice <br> reformist and economist. So much so that this year the direction of UOC (MLM) abandoned the boycott <br> electoral and tried to justify this right position for his militancy: <br> “These same considerations are the ones that this year led us to the decision not to campaign <br> Anti -election policy (…). At this time vote or not vote, vote for candidate X or the candidate <br> Y, or blank as some propose no importance. ” [UOC (MLM)] 441 <br> Argue that the electoral boycott is unimportant, that from the point of view of the politicization of the masses <br> makes vote or boycotting the elections, only the preparation of the terrain appears to advance a practice <br> Economicist for an electoral practice. After all, this is the inevitable result of the abandonment of Maoism and the <br> Denial of the Revolution of New Democracy in the countries oppressed by imperialism. <br> Finally, we would like to respond to the low attacks of the UOC Board (MLM) to the Communist Party of <br> Brazil -P.C.B .. <br> UOC (MLM) in its criticism of our party and LCI accuses us of "leftists" and sectarians. However, <br> the general line defended by it holds that the revolution in most semicolonial countries, such <br><br><br> “Oppressed capitalist countries,” would be immediately socialist. Defends, let's see more, for the revolution in <br> His country, an agrarian program that provides for the “collectivization” of the peasant lands. Argues that there is no <br> Need for a revolutionary national stage in the popular war in the semicolonial countries. Nega na <br> PRACTICE THE UNIVERSAL REVIEW OF THE NEW DEMOCRACY REVOLUTION FOR ALL SEMICOLONIAL COUNTRIES. Anyway, <br> It assumes in essence several Trotskist conclusions and we are “leftists”? <br> In the fight of two lines started last year (2022) with the publication of the discussion base, three <br> Colombian organizations took part in the debates: the proletarian power party organization M-L-M, the <br> Communist Party of Red Colombia and UOC (MLM). All these parties and organizations, in <br> different measures, criticized in some respects certain propositions contained in the base of discussion, <br> criticisms that have had counterpositions by other parties and organizations, due to some aspects of <br> Critics positions to the discussion bases. Of the three organizations of Colombia, only UOC (MLM) <br> refused to participate in CIMU. Both PPOPMLM and PCC-FR took part of the CIMU and participated <br> actively in the fight of two lines in the sessions of the conference. UOC (MLM) was the only organization of <br> Colombia who abandoned the fight of two lines in her first phase and sectaries are the parties and <br> Organizations that founded LCI? <br> UOC accusations (MLM) on “leftism” and sectarianism by the founders of LCI, <br> They simply do not support themselves. However, launching unfounded accusations seems to be becoming a <br> Specialty of the direction of UOC (MLM). At the end of its long critical document to P.C.B. and to <br> Founders of LCI, launch the following attack on our party: <br> “By the way, the second aspect of the incorrect method of comrades [sectarianism], we had already <br> known at a broad meeting in Brazil in 2016, for which we were formally invited, but <br> Given the presentation of our proposal to formulate a general line for MCI, the bosses <br> of the event incited as treatment 'death to revisionism!' (If the 'thought gonzalo' position, <br> intends to 'kill' revisionism, it means that they have not assimilated the A-B-C of the teachings and practices of <br> GRCP to combat it). <br> Despite the grotesque and humiliating that resulted in the treatment received in Brazil - except for <br> workers' comrades whose hospitality was exemplary and internationalist - we did not report <br> publicly (…) expecting some reconsideration of the hosts, who years later spoke to <br> comrades of another organization about a self -criticism, which we never receive directly (…). <br> Parodying the words of Engels, we have the hard choir to support the spikes of our own <br> comrades of struggle; Neither in Brazil 2016, not now, intimidate us their offenses. ” [UOC (MLM)] 442 <br> And this repulsive attack was, unfortunately, backed by leaders of the party's construction committee <br> Maoist Communist of Galicia, insofar as, in its position on the founding of LCI, <br> issue of referring to this low attack from UOC (MLM) to our party, including doing it <br> generic and vague, as you can see: <br> “In all the international contacts we had at MCI, all organizations always <br> treated with great courtesy and campaign, the same did not happen with UOC (MLM), which was <br> subject to unfair treatment by an organization that dedicates efforts to contribute <br> with the strengthening of MCI. ” (CCCPMG) 443<br>UOC (MLM) wants to become a victim in the ramant goal of disqualifying P.C.B. <br> By stating that they were treated “grotesque and humiliating” by P.C.B. in Brazil and, including with <br> cheap demagogy that “except for workers' comrades whose hospitality was exemplary and <br> internationalist". What sense would this event be like if it was P.C.B. Who invited UOC (MLM), as <br> attests to his own words in the document we now appreciate. Also, by stating that it did not report <br> Publicly said treatment - which for P.C.B. it would not be and it is not, in itself, any problems - because, not only <br> did so, as he said that we would have presented a "self -criticism" to another Colombian organization, without <br> Refer which one, about this alleged attack. To the direction of the CCP-FR, which in correspondence communicated to P.C.B. <br> that would have received from UOC (MLM) such prosecution, and to whom we respond that, in all facts that occurred in the <br> 2016 events in Brazil, the direction of P.C.B. had no information on such an occurrence and that <br> considered such an accusation absurd. The direction of UOC (MLM) did not even give us any criticism of <br> this supposed attack; did not even do his delegation to events in Brazil or later his <br> Direction by correspondence. <br><br><br> In fact, our knowledge about said attack, we only had by the said correspondence of the PCC- <br> FR to our party, and soon by a document published on the UOC web portal (MLM) that criticized the <br> joint statement in celebration of the bicentenary of the birth of the great Karl Marx, in 2018, that the <br> P.C.B. Firm; and in the document object of our present appreciation. Never our party would demot the fight <br> Ideological-political, just as we would never do a public controversy over such a low thing. Also, <br> our party did not do any self -criticism about it, because we do not treat any organization, however much <br> Be our differences, in a “grotesque and humiliating” way. We see now, with the persist of the direction of <br> UOC (mlm) In this cheerful attack on P.C.B., which is also of its methods the subjectivism of playing with the <br> words and trampled. Who do you want to deceive? To MCI or your own bases? <br> In 2016, shortly after that event the UOC (MLM) public appreciation on the activity was opposite: <br> “The celebration of the 50th anniversary of the great proletarian cultural revolution was also very <br> Well organized, a revolutionary and internationalist event. (…) In addition, the presence of <br> children, youth and women - mostly African descendants - who develop in the middle <br> of the struggle with great revolutionary conviction. There were also great agitators experienced <br> that gave vitality to the everybody. The revolutionary convictions, the state of spirit of the assistants, the <br> firmness of the paintings that has continued the revolutionary process in Brazil, allows you to trust <br> that imperialist capitalism will not last long in its agony process because <br> forces that will bury it. (…) For the communists of Colombia it was an honor to attend the event. ” <br> [UOC (MLM)] 444 <br> UOC (MLM), on the same activity, makes two antagonistic public appreciations in 2016 exalt their <br> realization; In 2018, in the same press agency they say they were “treated as dogs”, attacks that <br> repeat in their document of 2023. Which of the two evaluations express what actually occurred and what is the <br> true position of the direction of UOC (mlm)? <br> Such insistence from the direction of UOC (MLM) repeating lies forces us to clarify the facts well. Your delegation <br> was in Brazil, invited like all the others, to participate in the three scheduled activities: a seminar <br> About bureaucratic capitalism, a meeting at closed doors only from the delegations of parties and organizations <br> M-L-M, to discuss the meaning of the great proletarian cultural revolution (one day, duration of <br> 12 hours) and a political-cultural act of masses. In all of them, his delegation was franchised at the same time <br> intervention that to all other parties and organizations present. As UOC itself (MLM) states <br> In his attack on our party, his delegation was able to talk freely with the movement's militants <br> Revolutionary and their mass bases present in the two semi -open events. In which, without any <br> Restriction, they distributed photocopies of their proposal to formulate a general line to the MCI. What's <br> of “grotesque and humiliating” in this? Did the UOC Delegation (MLM) lacked decent hosting? No <br> Has you provided proper feed? Has not the use of the word been allowed to be allowed? Was denied him <br> Treatment equal to that dismissed to other guests? No, absolutely none of this occurred! <br> What the direction of UOC (MLM) does not report is that, convened its delegation to compose the event table <br> Political-cultural, she did not present herself and did not even deign to give any satisfaction. It was uncomfortable to have<br>found in the debates of previous events, that most parties and organizations present were <br> Defenders of President Gonzalo's contributions to the world proletarian revolution or because it was filled <br> With the hardness of clashes on bureaucratic capitalism? UOC's direction (MLM) launches all sorts of <br> epithets seeking to discredit the parties and Maoist organizations that defend the contributions of validity <br> Universal of President Gonzalo. It would then be the case that the direction of UOC (MLM which is very “fierce” in <br> Time to make your criticism and be too sensitive when receiving them? <br> Let's look at all the events of those events the only where we could deduce a possible cause <br> for the allegations of “grotesque and humiliating” treatment by our party to the delegation of <br> UOC (MLM), as absurd as this interpretation, was in the context of debates on capitalism <br> Bureaucratic, the fact that many of the participants echoed the consign of “death to revisionism”. If a <br> UOC Directorate (MLM) understood this as an “offense” directed to its organization, when in the context of <br> hard debates on bureaucratic capitalism, the blows were frontal and relentless against revisionism and <br> every opportunism, we just have to say that if it served as a carapuça, it is a problem with the delegation and direction of <br> UOC (MLM), this is a consign raised in any activity of Maoist revolutionaries. The direction of <br><br><br> P.C.B. It is the one who claims, understanding said consigns as directed to his organization is a very defensive attitude for <br> who points against so many Marxist-Leninist-Mauo parties, including those who support <br> Fight the popular war and accuse, as the Avakianists and Trotskyists do, of being dogmatic, who <br> start from the concrete analysis of the concrete situation present, that is, that violate the same soul of Marxism, <br> because they defend the new democracy revolution through the prolonged popular war in countries <br> oppressed. If it is not the case of sticking the hood in the head, we add to the said by Engels and quoted in <br> Your document of 2023, the teaching of President Mao, who at a conference of CCP frames <br> (1962), as if anticipating the radicalization that would come from the class struggle in the party between proletariat and <br> bourgeoisie, between Marxists and followers of the capitalist path, between left and right, summoned them to <br> "Thicken the scalp" to prepare to cross the storms. Because, unlike the <br> That affirms, your leather is still, very, very delicate. <br> A CCCPM leader of Galicia was present in this activity and surprised us very negatively <br> the support that gives the attacks of UOC (MLM), acting dubiously without openly directing the criticism of the <br> P.C.B .. In the struggle of two lines centrism serves to spread the confusion generated by the right and to breastfeed it. <br> We charge from Galicia CCCPM a clear position, which says whether or not the accusation of the <br> UOC (MLM) against our party, without tergiversalations, whether or not they were treated “grotesque and <br> humiliating ”for our party when they were in Brazil. The comrades of the CCCPM of Galicia were <br> proletarianly treated when they were in Brazil as it has been with the others and returned from the <br> even when a delegation of Brazilian revolutionaries were in Galicia. The communists <br> They should contribute to raising the level of the struggle of two lines and as a testimony of the alleged “unfair treatment” <br> To UOC (MLM), they must lend themselves to clarify the issue and not feed lies. <br> To conclude, we head to the Glorious MCI, the Heroic Communist Party of Peru - PCP and Party <br> Communist of Turkey/Marxist -Leninist - TKP/ML, founders of LCI, aiming at the bright wars <br> popular directed by their parties we have worked hard on boosting internationalism <br> proletarian and for developing the revolution in our country. The obligation and responsibility that imposes on us the <br> contingencies of the controversy, we saw ourselves in the duty to write at length about subjects that are <br> knowledge of all Marxists-Leninist-Maoists, aiming to raise the ideological struggle to the <br> Two lines. We also address the Heroic PCI (M) and PCF, torches of the world proletarian revolution, <br> we greeted the public positions of fraternal parties and publicly reaffirm our decision to <br> boost the old relationship between our parties, relationships that, unfortunately, were interrupted by <br> contingencies of the revolutionary class struggle and not for other reasons, aiming to take more steps towards <br> complete overcoming of dispersion in MCI and its solid unity. Particularly, PCI (M) and PCF, <br> As it is placed in its LCI assessments to its criticism of the political and principle declaration, P.C.B. <br> reaffirms the commitment to follow the debates and clarifications with the PCI (m) in bilateral form and <br> others, direct and organized ”.<br>We also address the other participating and supporters of LCI. In the present <br> document we seek to correspond to the very high level of discussions and the fights of two lines locked <br> at the Unified International International Conference. We greeted everyone for the intense campaigns and the resolute <br> and tireless revolutionary work brought to practice in the course of this year, driven by the thriving <br> Fight for the future reconstitution of the communist international international. <br> Finally, we head to the direction of UOC (MLM), we believe in the struggle of two lines, the critic <br> transformation. We seek to answer here, from the theoretical and ideological point of view, the erroneous positions <br> planting by your organization, we seriously study your documents and seek to extract from them <br> important lessons. We hope that the present fight of two lines contributes to the rectification of these errors, <br> for the boosting the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Colombia, for the development of <br> Revolution in this important Latin American country. The fate of the peoples of our countries is intertwined <br> Inevitably in the fight against the common enemy, imperialism, especially Yankee. The hordes <br> bloodthirsty of this colossus of clay feet, sooner than late, will be buried between the forest <br> Amazonian and the Andes of the Andes and the American people will bury him forever and ever. We are <br> certain that under the direction of their respective communist parties, the proletariat and the Colombian peasantry <br> And Brazilian will come together in this common task, in the service of the world proletarian revolution! <br><br><br> Long live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism! <br> Below revisionism and all kinds of opportunism! <br> Long live the invincible popular war! <br> Long live proletarian internationalism! <br> Long live the world proletarian revolution! <br> Long live the 130th anniversary of President Mao Tsetung's Christmas! <br> Long live the International Communist League! <br> Communist Party of Brazil - P.C.B. <br> Central committee <br><br><br> International Communist Liga, Political Declaration and Principles, 2022, our translation and our blacks. <br> 2 International Communist Liga, Political Declaration and Principles, 2022, our translation and our blacks. <br> 3V.
