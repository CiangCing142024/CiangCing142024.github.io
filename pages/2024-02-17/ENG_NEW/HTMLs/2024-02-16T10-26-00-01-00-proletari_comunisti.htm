   <br/>
   <br/>
   The numbers can be inhumanizing. Alone, hardly 
 they could transmit the reality of the Israeli genocide in progress to 
 Gaza. The latest official numbers, however, are critical.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The government office for the media of Gaza has published an update 
  On the scope of the destruction made by the Israeli army 
 in the besieged gaza strip, starting from 7 October.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The count is not definitive, due to the fact that over 7,000 
 Palestinians are dispersed and are presumed to have died - under the 
 rubble of their homes, or scattered through the streets in areas that 
 Civil Protection operators cannot reach.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The numbers, statistics and estimates that concern the period between 7 October 2023 and 11 February 2024.
