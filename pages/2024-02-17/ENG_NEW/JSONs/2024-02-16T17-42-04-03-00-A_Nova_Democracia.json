Based on stereotypes, this approach has created habitable habits among Arab viewers, for whom cinema has become a kind of opium. He pushed the public out of real problems, overshadowing his lucidity and conscience. At times throughout the history of Arab cinema, of course, there have been serious attempts to express the reality of our world and their problem, but they were quickly suffocated by the supporters of the reaction, who fought fiercely against any emergency of a new cinema.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although recognizing the legitimate concern these attempts had, it should, however, be clear that, in terms of content, they were usually underdrew and, at a formal level, always inadequate. It seems that one could never escape the heavy heritage of conventional cinema.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The June 67 defeat, however, was a shocking experience and raised some fundamental issues. Finally, young talents committed to creating a completely new cinema in the Arab world, convinced filmmakers that a complete change should affect both form and content have also appeared.\n </p>\n <p>\n  These new films raise questions about the reasons for our defeat and take courageous positions in favor of resistance.

The attempts of world Zionism since 1897 in exploring the use of cinema and its ability to influence the broader masses can no longer continue, in their domination, just as before, due to the defeats that imperialism received from the hands of peoples in Fight in the world.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the Palestinian resistance movement, the techniques of film production were developed, which recorded the reality of the revolution. However, in their early days, they did not go beyond the recording of some documentation, without moving to a broader scope, in vision and obscurity. Perhaps the initiative of the Popular Liberation Front of Palestine, from 1970, played an important role in this field, when it began to produce documentaries, in view of the ability of these films to express the revolution and their thinking and to be a linked base to reality in a material way. This activity occurred at several levels:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Permanent exhibitions on Fedayins and Palestinian refugee fields;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Film shows in organizations and cultural clubs and working areas;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Greater attention to film festivals, to consolidate relationships: on the one hand, for the frequent participation of Palestinian cinema and progressive international cinema, on the other, the possibility of Palestinian resistance, in particular the Popular Front, to show the true facts of Palestinian struggle and the implications of the Palestinian cause. Thus, he exposed the essence of Zionist forgery and portrayed the closest image of the truth about the Palestinian cause, raising the voice of the Palestinian cause for the first time through the Leipzig Festival in 1971. After that, Palestinian cinema went through many festivals, us What is the relationship between Palestinian revolutionary cinema and world cinema was strengthened, so that it unified in the same line of exposing the fascist methods of colonialists and invaders, and portray the continuous struggles and victories of peoples;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Distribution of Palestinian films to political parties and student and workers' organizations around the world. The role of these films was very important, both to incorporate the thought, strategy and continuous struggle of the revolution, and to refute the allegations of Zionism and its exploiting and fascist way of thinking.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Preserve the cinematic and photographic documentation of the Palestinian Revolution in a special archive, as a source material not only for Palestinian filmmakers, but also for friends who want to participate in the revolution through Palestinian films.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Train the combatants to record movies and forge frames that can use the camera side by side with the rifle in the fight for liberation.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  In addition to this cinematic work, the activity included another side in the field of cinema culture, creating human consciousness, in order to highlight the value of revolutionary cinema and the role of cinema in the march of the revolution, and, from the experiences of cinema in The whole world, clarify its role in the struggle against imperialism, monopoly and the values of capitalist thinking, through the art of making cinema.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was through the cultural section of\n  <em>\n   the goal\n  </em>\n  , the main magazine that speaks in the name of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, as well as through courses and lectures organized by the Front Artistic Committee. Aware of the importance of this vehicle of culture, FPLP is striving to develop this aspect through continuous productions and exhibitions, as well as the consolidation of ties with all filmmakers in the world that strive to expose all types of domination and exploitation, in order to break the monopolistic strangulation that is applied by the world capitalist companies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Palestinian cinema has played an active and effective role during its short life and within the limitations of its activity. After the cinema has long been absent from participation in the course of events, now the Palestinian films have been a new and growing phenomenon within the broader phenomenon that is armed, linked to it and expressing it of a phenomenon that is a phenomenon. form or another. Although the total sum of Palestinian film activity remained confined to some initiatives and below the proper planning and programming standards, it has made a long leap. There is no doubt that the criterion for the development of Palestinian cinema lies in the maturation of political and cultural conscience about the importance of cinema, to absorb more deeply and firmly the Leninist assessment of cinema, not just as an admiration and East to the potential importance that the teacher of the proletariat has seen in the cinema as a means of provoking the awakening and resurgence (of all the arts, considered the cinema the most important). We will work with all our efforts and capabilities to direct these words, so that Palestine's combatant cinema can advance to the first ranks within the world film movement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   4.

The unit had 3 members: two (Hani Jawharieh and Mustafa Abu there) had studied cinema in London; The third - a comrade (Sulfa Jadallah) - had studied in Cairo. They immediately asked if artistic standards studied were corresponding to Palestinian aspirations at a time when the armed struggle was beginning to develop. Should they speak to their audience with London or Cairo -learned shapes or should be seeking to develop an original style capable of playing the Palestinian and Arabs masses? Even more: could they express our armed revolution in foreign forms? Should they imitate invented and used styles by film language combined with colonialism, or should it create and develop new modes of expression - a new cinematic language linked to Arab heritage in general and particular Palestinian resistance?\n </p>\n <p>\n  This was the important question that marked the nature and work of the unit group since its origin. It was clear from the beginning that the way would be long and difficult and that it would also lead us to evolve. The question was to find the way through which popular cinema could express the popular war.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The experience with the movie \u201cWith Soul, With Blood\u201d\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The answer to this question was given to us by doing \u201cwith soul, with blood\u201d by Mustafa Abu Ali. During the events of September 1970 in Jordan, the unit was able to film several sequences in synchronized sound. Adding to other scenes that had been filmed earlier, we had special material to advance and test our ideas about militant cinema. Unfortunately, after September 1970, all the unit's work rested on the shoulders of only one of its three members: Sulafa Jadallah was hit by a bullet, which left her partially paralyzed, and Hany Jawharieh was isolated by the siege and unable to regroup. Mustafa Abu Ali felt the need to offer a political analysis of events in Jordan and was asked to restrict her work to the sequences already recorded. It was only after several discussions that he agreed on the need to gather the sequences, based on a thorough political analysis.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The question, therefore, was no longer to make a documentary, but to make a militant movie. For us, the difference between the two lies in the fact that a militant film uses documentary recording and other materials as the basis for formulating an elaborate political statement, while a documentary is generally limited to the simple juxtaposition of documents. Thus, political analysis became the main axis of filmic work, in a sense replacing the scenario itself. The analysis was developed with the participation of the maximum resistance frames the possible, with the director restricting themselves to translating it into technical and material terms. The interaction between the political and cinematic element lasted for four months, during which various editing styles were tested, usually based on two rhythms - fast and slow - particularly during the first sequence, where illustrations were used to better illustrate the content . Each editing rhythm was tested on exhibitions in the refugee camps, and it was in this way that we decided to abandon the fast pace. This also led to the decision to abandon the illustrations and replace them with instructive scribbles made by children. The author thought that the scribble would be closer to the real conditions than the illustrations and most easily understood by our audience.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But following this, after several consultations with the people, the unit decided to abandon the symbolic style of the beginning of the film.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Popular consultations\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Among the various consultations made by the unit, one was considered particularly interesting to grasp the reactions of the Palestinian people. These consultations, which were made in the refugee camps, in the guerrilla bases, and in advanced schools, concern the reception of films made by the unit, movies of foreign friends about Palestine and illustrative films of the action of national liberation movements around world. The unit raised a series of questions and distributed them to viewers before the screenings. The answers either were delivered back directly before the exhibitions, during another projection or sent back later, by any appropriate means. After a while, we met a pile of documentation and important information, most of them coming from Palestinians in Lebanon or Syria. All screenings included, among other films, \"with soul, with blood.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Six impressions were inevitable:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   The warm reception and applause that films have confirmed the concern that our people have in their primary interest: the revolution.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   This concern proves the significance of cinema as a popular environment and underlines the need for the filmmaker to have a strong political awareness.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Reactions to Vietnamese, Algerian and Cuban movies, and in general any movie that concerns armed struggle are no different from the reactions to Palestinian films. This confirms that our people are aware that their fight against Zionism clearly fits the most general context of international struggle against imperialism.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Spectators prefer realism to all other artistic styles.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Spectators used to commercial films tend to manifest defeatism in their reactions to certain films, most notably about \"with soul, with blood,\" which surprise them. Because they are not familiar with militant cinema, they become unable to form a clear opinion. However, discussions and reexivities help to clarify them.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The insistence with which the people ask for more exhibitions clearly demonstrate their need to discuss their concerns and discover the struggles of other peoples. Unit members have firmly convinced that whatever the question should be transmitted to the masses, as they are the main interested parties.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  In addition, the unit met with all foreign filmmakers who came to film or report Palestinian resistance, promoting discussions that were very fruitful in terms of the evolution of ideas about militant cinema in the Middle East and worldwide. The unit also won a lot when contacting progressive filmmakers at various international festivals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Conclusions\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The unit has made several conclusions of its experiences:\n </p>\n <ol>\n  <li>\n   Militant cinema is a new experience in the filmic world. It is observed that he really developed with the armed and popular revolutions in Vietnam, Cuba, Algeria and Palestine. It also emerges in the fighting of Latin America, and with struggles in North America and Europe, where collectives make films denouncing imperialism and celebrating popular resistance. It is from the popular war that our militant cinema takes the patterns of their work, as well as their inspiration.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The militant film collective must, in our view, perform all the operations from the writing of the argument to the projection of the film. At each step, a cell, strategic and tactically involved with the problem with which the film is leaning should be considered.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The production of a militant film has a double nature, as its authors must have two factors in mind: provisional tactics and long-term strategy in the fight. In any event, the militant movie should be \"useful as bread and not superfluous as a perfume.\"\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Militant work in cinema cannot achieve its purpose without projection of the film before the masses involved in the struggle in question. The filmmaker should therefore move to present his film himself, whether open or clandestine exhibitions, depending on the stage or nature of the fight. The relationships between the filmmaker and the masses must be continuous, pervading all the stages of the film's making.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   Finally, militant cinema must have a number of qualities. It must have truly revolutionary content; a serious approach; take into account the actual reception of the hearing to those who go; and be able to counteract the cinema that comes from the imperialist world.\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   5.

But in both cases the criterion must be its usefulness.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From another point of view, revolutionary cinema must meet four requirements:\n </p>\n <ul>\n  <li>\n   The justity of inspiration-the filmmaker must obey revolutionary ideology and devote himself to put it into practice.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The subject must be treated seriously-to this end, one should end the traditional methods of Hollywood cinema and replace them with methods adapted to the needs of the fighting people in order to express their hopes and aspirations as accurately as possible as possible as possible .\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The message must be transmitted correctly - language must be simple, clear aesthetics; Cinematographic extravagance and stylistic pyrotechnics need to be refused. Generally, complications should be avoided and fighting for clarity so that the masses understand the revolutionary content of the film. It is necessary to closely examine the question of the relationship between the film and the masses, starting from the very conception that people have from cinema so that they can transform it. Currently\u2026 cinema in its entirety has a negative influence. Why? Because it is considered as a hobby, even an opium, a drug. Only with the correspondence between the masses and the filmmakers will a new conception of cinema be established.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   The mission of revolutionary cinema must be, above all, to deal with local and more crucial problems, dealing with living reality in all its dimensions - political, social, economic and cultural. The description of this reality must also unravel the deep and fundamental causes of the evils that the people suffer and to define and clearly condemn those responsible. Finally, you need to exhort the masses to change what doesn't work.\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <p>\n  In this perspective, revolutionary filmmakers, who are they, should not forget that the main target must be military, economic and cultural imperialism that enslaves and loots Africa, Asia and Latin America. Ignorance, poverty and underdevelopment of these areas have their origins in the policy of imperialism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Needless to say that we are looking for contacts with all foreign friends to discuss these problems and, together, define a new type of cinema in all countries in the world, but especially in the Third World, which needs to break free from enslavement cultural of Western imperialism. We want a popular cinema where the people are in the process of making history.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   6. \u201cPalestinian images\u201d, latest photographs by Hani Jawharieh, 1978\n
