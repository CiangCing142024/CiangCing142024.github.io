First, the tuition fees for the graduate of the argument that it was \"another cycle of study\" and are therefore excluded from the protection of Article 16. Then came the \"foreign language\" programs with their astronomical tuition fees and pierced the Greek schools with the government's argument. That is something \"other\" from Greek programs. The Hellenic Open University has touched its degrees on the grounds that they are a \"fees\" of \"distance education\" which is something \"other\" from classical education. On all of the above, the Government closed to say in January that the historical oath of \"free\" is no longer in practice and that Article 16 is capable of \"interpretation\". Today, it is attempting the greatest step of everything with the establishment of private universities and at the same time introduces tuition fees to the \"regular\" Greek -speaking undergraduate with the argument that they will concern \"foreigners\" admissions. The cluster around the free character of studies in Greece narrows and the Pierrakakis bill is intended to be the leading act of reactionary work on the path of successive governments to abolish public free education.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u00b7 The Pierrakakis bill brings to Greece two -speed candidates to the Pan -Hellenic exams depending on the height of their wallet. Introduction to private universities through nationwide exams is a ridiculous transitional measure to blur the waters, as entry into private universities is a nail of the children of poor popular families who strive for a place in the sun. But how to hide the fact that the Molecules of Imports to Private Universities will be below half of the respective schools for which the \"Plaba\" will compete? And somewhere here they go for a walk the tragic arguments about excellence and the necessity of establishing the base of the 10 that, in order to be imposed, was exhausted by admissible students of previous years. Today, masks fall and class provocation in education is launching beyond any previous one.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u00b7 The Pierrakakis bill further simplifies the mergers and abolitions of sections that will now be made with the \"consent of the Independent Higher Education Authority\", while enhancing the role of evaluation. With a lever in evaluation, mergers at regional universities and the shrinkage of the Higher Education Charter means a reduction in admission positions, deterioration of conditions for students who are already within the merger of schools and the loss of professional rights. The case of the Democritus University of Thrace included in the bill is characteristic as it is planned to absorb parts of Drama and Kavala and the merger of schools in Komotini.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u00b7 Bachelor-Master-PhDs and the fragmentation of diplomas are directly provided by the bill as it describes the functioning of foreign private schools based on their parenting curricula. This means, among other things, that a three -year undergraduate studies are planned to come to Greece for the first time. The dissolution of the uniforms of diplomas and graduates brings the complete dissolution of professional rights and the even faster conversion of the degree into a simple card-card certificate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Pierrakakis bill is a reactionary incision that does not come to \"stay on the cards\" but to fully transform the landscape of higher education in Greece.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It doesn't have to go through!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our struggle must escalate with new rounds of general occupations and demonstrations. Our allies are the students who will massively suffer the consequences of all this policy, working parents, teachers and our whole people. The only answer that can be given is the massive struggle on the road that set the 2006-2007 movement to take the government back the Pierrakakis bill.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Neither \"on paper\" no nowhere - here and now the Pierrakkaki bill to be withdrawn!\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   NO IN PRIVATE UNIVERSITY\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   NO REVIEW OF ARTICLE 16\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   PUBLIC FREE EDUCATION FOR ALL PEOPLE\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"672\" data-original-width=\"1920\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXT9g_bklPp2Cv6oDOLpfbvJO-ZrudV7hvRdKChoDW4Y7t1ptmYE1Dk7-hZAuzgPazZSE_QMedmzCs8UP-awMuv2OyTN9XOH7f8uvcyCKF2jOJZ8eYvMM-QM01vYN1Jn9VclhyfbTm2F6N5twmNavnz6Q-c6AtT5HQxT35RIZH9SZH38pq6CiwQRjAFuln/s320/logo_ak_site.png\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXT9g_bklPp2Cv6oDOLpfbvJO-ZrudV7hvRdKChoDW4Y7t1ptmYE1Dk7-hZAuzgPazZSE_QMedmzCs8UP-awMuv2OyTN9XOH7f8uvcyCKF2jOJZ8eYvMM-QM01vYN1Jn9VclhyfbTm2F6N5twmNavnz6Q-c6AtT5HQxT35RIZH9SZH38pq6CiwQRjAFuln/s320/logo_ak_site.png\" width=\"320\"/>\n </div>\n <br/>\n <b>\n  <br/>\n </b>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3.\u039c."], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1", "\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/blog-post_47.html"}
