The gathering was invited by ADEDY's DO on accuracy, at the request of teachers' associations, and the Student Association for Pierrakakis, who conveyed the established morning course in the afternoon. Despite this \"meeting\", and although it was supported by the KKE (which was his own idea) the course was relatively small, and in fact it did not show either one issue.\n <p>\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"2084\" data-original-width=\"3702\" height=\"225\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj19NZjU2EElLdIodyWScx0gk5oz7wM9G-7kBe6ySRKroyEgipX_7igodNCSZBHbJkmHsvauUU4ofmrid_BUm_EVTeWb4RxwwVX4mHjV4alNqBYHsV934q8WbfRbkW-PIacAl8r31q-9oVvKV5AAZb7PU4pZALPNlFEgpsTEOU4On9faNg7b3mq-UrUtooT/w400-h225/2024-2-15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj19NZjU2EElLdIodyWScx0gk5oz7wM9G-7kBe6ySRKroyEgipX_7igodNCSZBHbJkmHsvauUU4ofmrid_BUm_EVTeWb4RxwwVX4mHjV4alNqBYHsV934q8WbfRbkW-PIacAl8r31q-9oVvKV5AAZb7PU4pZALPNlFEgpsTEOU4On9faNg7b3mq-UrUtooT/w400-h225/2024-2-15.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n </div>\n <p>\n  The student club, the teaching club, the Association of Private Employees and the Racing Movements-Classroom with a common bloc, which was the most vibrant, participated in the process.\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Of course there is a need to unite on the way to the race students with workers on a common front of fighting. But the mobilization of ADEDY's DE was completely pretentious (not even banners), while on the other hand the refusal of KNE-EAK's block to take a clear and categorical position and attitude against the tele-exports, the dilution of the assemblies (every ten days ) And the lack of internal life in occupation (unique political action The event with a school teacher) threw the mass, despite the existing moods of the students.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9", "\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1", "\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/15_16.html"}
