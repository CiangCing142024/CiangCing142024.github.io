Exploration is also supported by the federal government. The prohibition issued by the local judiciary had been an achievement of the region's indigenous and peasants, who have already made several complaints against the imperialist company.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The judicial dispute began officially when, in 2023, the Federal Court of the 1st Federal Civil Court of the Judicial Section of Amazonas (SJAM) was forced to admit the obvious unconstitutionality of the licensing of the company Potassium do Brasil Ltda in the mineral exploration project in region, after numerous complaints from local indigenous peoples. This decision, however, does not seem to be consonant with the higher sectors of the judiciary who, last month, reacted to guarantee imperialist interests in the region.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169013\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real.png 997w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real-300x205.png 300w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real-768x525.png 768w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real-60x41.png 60w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real.png\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reproducao-Amazonia-Real.png\" width=\"997\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Urucurituba Indigenous Territory.

Months later, higher sectors of the judiciary reacted to popular conquest and decided to go back with the decision to guarantee imperialist interests in the region.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The reaction in question was by Judge Marcos Augusto de Souza, acting vice president of TRF-1. The jurist, in his veto decision, also made a point of rebuking the position of the state judiciary, where he should \u201cavoid improper interference from the judiciary in the regular exercise of administrative functions by the constituted authorities, which results in serious injury to public and administrative order \u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Federal Court's decision has vigorous government support. Still in March 2023, Vice President of the Republic, Geraldo Alckmin (PSB), said during the 308th meeting of the Suframa Board of Directors in Manaus, that the federal government will work \u201cwith commitment\u201d to make the exploration project possible of potassium in autozes. The project also has unconditional support from the Minister of Agriculture, Carlos F\u00e1varo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Meanwhile, hundreds of Mura -in -ethnic families who inhabit the Soares village are still dropped to their own luck. Indians require the demarcation of areas as an indigenous land since 2003, but organs such as Ibama and Funai have never given a deadline for the demarcation of the territory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Lesa-Patria Project had also been approved and locally favored by figures such as the governor of Amazonas, Wilson Lima (Uni\u00e3o Brasil) and state deputy Sin\u00e9sio Campos (PT).\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169012\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-1024x683.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-1024x683.png 1024w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-300x200.png 300w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-768x512.png 768w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-60x40.png 60w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-720x480.png 720w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom.png 2048w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-1024x683.png\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Governador-Wilson-Lima-com-o-presidente-da-empresa-Potassio-do-Brasil-Adriano-Espeschit-Foto-Secom-1024x683.png\" width=\"1024\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Governor Wilson Lima with the president of the company Potassium do Brasil, Adriano Espeschit.

In the same region, however, there is also a huge potassium chloride mine that quickly attracted the interest of Canadian imperialist companies. The case that has been lasting decades has been classified by the Royal Amazon Investigative Journalism Agency as \u201cthe Potassium War in Autozes\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The company fa\u00e7ade created to advance the exploration of the call by \u201cProject Autazes\u201d, was Potassium do Brasil Ltda. The allegedly national name hides, however, that more than 70% of the company's funds are controlled by Canadian and British investors, in particular, those of companies\n  <em>\n   Forbes&amp;Manhattan\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <em>\n   CD Capital\n  </em>\n  and the\n  <em>\n   The Sentient Group\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  When the investers began against the territory of the Soares village, the imperialists began with the classic tactics of bribe and harassment. Milton Menezes, one of the local indigenous leaders, described the first approaches, almost 10 years ago, from company agents to the Amazon Real:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThe first time, they arrived offering $ 900 to pierce my land. They insisted that it was a lot of money. I didn't authorize, I saw that it was not a good thing. But then they ended up piercing elsewhere without my consent. Then they wanted to buy my land. They said I could even be kicked out if I didn't sell. I didn't accept it, \u201dhe says.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169015\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-1024x656.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-1024x656.png 1024w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-300x192.png 300w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-768x492.png 768w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-60x38.png 60w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real.png 1170w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"656\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-1024x656.png\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Milton-Ribeiro-Menezes-do-povo-Mura-em-sua-casa-flutuante-a-margem-do-Lago-do-Soares-Foto-Bruno-KellyAmazonia-Real-1024x656.png\" width=\"1024\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Milton Ribeiro Menezes, from the Mura people, in their flashing house on the sidelines of the Soares Lake.
