After the 1964 military coup, Alipio did not abandon the fight and went on to clandestinity. He even lived in Cuba, where he planned his return to Brazil. Back in the country, he was arrested in 1970 and was brutally tortured by the gorillas of the military regime. Torture did not heat it.

In 2010, he participated in an expanded meeting of the Poor Peasant League Commission in Goi\u00e2nia, and in the same year joined the Editorial Board of\n   <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">\n    AND\n   </span>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: var( --e-global-color-primary ); font-family: \"barlow semi condensed\", sans-serif; font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.3; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: center;'>\n   Read the full LCP note below:\n  </h4>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n   <em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">\n    <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;\">\n     LCP-Brazil Message to Guadalupe Portelinha for the celebrations of the 95th year of birth of Al\u00edpio de Freitas\n    </span>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n   On February 17, 2024, 95 years of the birth of the revolutionary Al\u00edpio de Freitas, president of honor of the League of the Poor Peasants-Brazil, are completed.\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n   We greet your celebrations, how important it is to do!\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n   Here in Brazil, the companions of the Belo Horizonte Construction Workers Union (popularly known for over 35 years by the name Marreta, the organization of workers who resumed the union direction for the class expelling the interveners of the military dictatorship), and also The Oper\u00e1ria League, which together have one of the most heard radio programs in the capital of Minas Gerais, will pay tribute, which will be accompanied by peasants across the country in the revolutionary areas won by the LCP, in dozens of acts of celebrations conducted across the country .\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n   Let's send you the audio, maybe arrive in time for your celebrations.\n  </p>\n  <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n   We are also sending them, attached, the LCP 2024 calendars, dealing with two very current topics, on which our dear president dedicated generous years of his indomitable struggle: Heroic Palestinian National Resistance and Agrarian Revolution ( the struggle for the conquest of the land by the Brazilian peasants).
