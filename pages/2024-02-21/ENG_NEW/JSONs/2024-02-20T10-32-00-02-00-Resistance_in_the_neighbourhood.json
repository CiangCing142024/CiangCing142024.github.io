In the face of this race, the system has recruited repression. It has raised the issue of remotelying in the schools that make occupations. In some universities, the tele-examination program has already come out. At Panteion from the outset, the Rector held a medieval attitude. Calming issues of dilation, he threw the burden on the departments to decide how the exam would be done.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From the outset we believe that the recruitment of the tele-expiry of the system is essentially a (tele) suppression of our struggles. In essence, it is an indirect way to \"break\" the occupations since a university in which exams are performed, so it works, is not under occupation. Students read and so they cannot support the activities of the occupation, the general assemblies of the student club and the demonstrations. This clearly appeared in the fallen mass mass of the General Assembly last week, as well as in Thursday's demonstration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Rector in Panteion kept a waiting attitude from the outset and when he saw that the pressure of the government had intensified showed a more real person. Giving the departments the opportunity to determine how they will conduct the examination (telephone or live) shows that they are not with the students nor does it defend (like any other) interests. The role of the Rectors and the Grand Governors is the expertise and implementation of the attack on each university, department and school in particular.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition to the attitude of the Rector and that of the Association's forces, we consider problematic. On the one hand, we have the PASP that clearly says that it is in favor of release, making it even more obvious what the majority of students already know. That is not against his system and politics but, on the contrary, with her proposals she wants to disorient the students and not let the struggle evolve. On the other hand, we have the forces of the MScs and the ESAK which also does not allow students to react to the implementation of the Reminder. The PCC has not yet taken a clear position against the remotelying, it is silently accepting it and in some schools even urging students to give. And Anasa (EAKA) while against the remote examination does not clearly take the place of abstention and therefore does not answer the members of the student association. The only clear attitude against the reminders is that of the apostate precisely because it leaves no room for it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Already the departments of public administration, VIS and EMPO have decided to conduct their exams remotely. We denounce these decisions and call on all students of these departments as well as any student who will be raised from the remote control issue. Through our Student Association and its collective processes to defend our right to public free education and to demand that the examination be carried out in human terms of life in time the club decides after we overthrow the bill on private universities.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Not on the remote -examination - television\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    APPLICATION OF THE TELL\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Not in private universities\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Live examinations when student associations decide\n   </b>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"672\" data-original-width=\"1920\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4tdv8iPWzYSiB1C7BdM6zo_LQORjl1EiloB5XSeox7zhmNpF2MPYvalLTRbY_KnhcHx-X384gEtTTsopqQsspwXP_9kEtBnJeANiIPe40orjGhgynVf0t8NU62izmTI6tmZLygn9cIGLrgwBXhvWMuuaGt_kMbMPcQsdplAFdW9Y-UveO1Q7RA3u49m0/s320/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4tdv8iPWzYSiB1C7BdM6zo_LQORjl1EiloB5XSeox7zhmNpF2MPYvalLTRbY_KnhcHx-X384gEtTTsopqQsspwXP_9kEtBnJeANiIPe40orjGhgynVf0t8NU62izmTI6tmZLygn9cIGLrgwBXhvWMuuaGt_kMbMPcQsdplAFdW9Y-UveO1Q7RA3u49m0/s320/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" width=\"320\"/>\n  </div>\n  <br/>\n  <b>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n </div>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div>\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf", "\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/blog-post_20.html"}
