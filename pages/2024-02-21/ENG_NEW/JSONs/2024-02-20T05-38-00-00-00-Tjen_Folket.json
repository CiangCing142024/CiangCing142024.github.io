The most significant threats to the Norwegian nation are, according to them, Russia, China and \"extreme Islamism\" and \"right -wing extremism\" .\n </p>\n <p>\n  The e-service writes in the introduction in its report:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cNorway is facing a more serious threat than in decades. In that war in Ukraine enters its third year, Russia is in the process of acquiring a military takeover. [\u2026] Russia is stronger in the war than a year ago, and Russian military power remains the dimensioning military threat to Norway's sovereignty, population, territory, central social functions and infrastructure. \u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  If China they write:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIn foreign policy, economic strength remains Beijing's most important tool. China will continue to seek increased influence in international forums and to reduce western countries, especially the US, dominant position. Strengthening relationships with countries in the global south are central, among other things, to build political and economic alliances and ensure access to critical minerals. \u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  About militant Islamists and right -wing extremists, they write that the threat from these is increasing, especially in the long run, and that \"the\" war between Israel and Hamas has great radicalization potential and helps to increase the terror threat in Europe \". Furthermore, they write that attacks from these are typically performed by individuals with simple means, that the potential for damage is therefore smaller, but the more difficult to avert.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Head of E-service Nils Andreas Stens\u00f8nes summarizes:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThe further security policy development depends not only on the threat we describe, but also on how the West chooses to relate to the development. Many countries hold elections this year. The security policy tension and economic uncertainty increase the political contradictions in Western countries as well. \u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  PST, for its part, states that they consider \"anti-state extremists\" and \"extremists motivated by climate, environmental and nature conservation cases\" as little to very little real threats, but that \"climate, environmental and conservation cases have the potential to radicalize\" .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Beyond that, neither PST nor NSM seems to have much to add the E-service's analysis. The three reports appear so similar that it is practically just the propgandist packaging that separates them. Basically, they do not point to other factors and conditions than the communist movement internationally and in Norway have long ago analyzed and put forward in much greater depth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The imperialists are in deep general crisis, which is reflected in all spheres of society, both economically, politically and culturally, and in Norway as well as at the international level. The rulers are constantly declining to rule in the same way as before, and cannot help but spend ever -increasing proportions of their resources on military armor and on reactionary, nationalist propaganda.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Also read:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-tjen-folket-media wp-block-embed-tjen-folket-media\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vBZe2hFXcX\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <a href=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2023/08/12/om-militarisering-og-reaksjonering-i-norge-i-dag/\">\n     About militarization and reaction in Norway today\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vBZe2hFXcX\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"255\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2023/08/12/om-militarisering-og-reaksjonering-i-norge-i-dag/embed/#?secret=aFBR6eI4X2#?secret=vBZe2hFXcX\" title=\"\u00abOm militarisering og reaksjonering i Norge i dag\u00bb \u2014 Tjen Folket Media\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-tjen-folket-media wp-block-embed-tjen-folket-media\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Emh7XJYJhS\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <a href=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2023/12/17/norge-nammo-kartlegger-palestina-aktivister/\">\n     Norway: Nammo maps Palestine activists\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Emh7XJYJhS\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"533\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2023/12/17/norge-nammo-kartlegger-palestina-aktivister/embed/#?secret=RIiMEW394x#?secret=Emh7XJYJhS\" title=\"\u00abNorge: Nammo kartlegger Palestina-aktivister\u00bb \u2014 Tjen Folket Media\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-tjen-folket-media wp-block-embed-tjen-folket-media\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Qw8H0xTQfl\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <a href=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2023/05/08/om-den-sakalte-forsvarskommisjonen/\">\n     About the so -called Defense Commission\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Qw8H0xTQfl\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"255\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2023/05/08/om-den-sakalte-forsvarskommisjonen/embed/#?secret=RYETVmTqEX#?secret=Qw8H0xTQfl\" title=\"\u00abOm den s\u00e5kalte forsvarskommisjonen\u00bb \u2014 Tjen Folket Media\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   References:\n  </strong>\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"https://www.nrk.no/norge/e-tjenesten_-mer-alvorlig-trusselbilde-enn-pa-flere-tiar-1.16756934\">\n   E-service: believes Russia is about to force take over in Ukraine\n  </a>\n  (nrk.no)\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"https://www.etterretningstjenesten.no/publikasjoner/fokus/fokus-norsk/Fokus2024%20-%20NO%20-%20Weboppslag%20v2.pdf/_/attachment/inline/cd45b8b4-c932-4e85-964b-d8c83efd8f40:c2b3b54d5beef80df58e325ec77a571c9583fc91/Fokus2024%20-%20NO%20-%20Weboppslag%20v2.pdf\">\n   Focus 2024\n  </a>\n  (etterretningstjenesten.no)\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"https://www.pst.no/globalassets/2024/ntv2024/nasjonal-trusselvurdering-2024_uuweb.pdf\">\n   National threat assessment 2024\n  </a>\n  (pst.no)\n  <br/>\n  <a href=\"https://nsm.no/getfile.php/1313477-1707733210/NSM/Filer/Dokumenter/Rapporter/Risiko%202024.pdf\">\n   Risk 2024\n  </a>\n  (nsm.no)\n </p>\n</section>\n", "source": "https://tjen-folket.no/2024/02/20/den-norske-statens-trusselvurdering-2024/", "type": "article", "title": "The Norwegian State Threat Assessment 2024", "description": "Last week, the Norwegian state's three bodies responsible for national security presented their annual analyzes of the security policy situation.", "modified time": "2024-02-20T13:21:34+00:00", "author": ["Tjen Folket Media"], "categories": ["Innenriks"]}
