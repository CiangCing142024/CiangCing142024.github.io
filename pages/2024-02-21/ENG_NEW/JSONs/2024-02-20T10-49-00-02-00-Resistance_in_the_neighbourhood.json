A name that condenses and is the trigger for the road we need to walk!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Accuracy exhausts popular income!\n  </b>\n  Continuous price, expensive products on supermarket shelves, inflated electricity bills, low wages and unemployment make our lives lifeless. Auctions threaten and take our homes, the hardships of a lifetime.\n  <b>\n   We don't praise! We are fighting for life with dignity and rights!\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Students and students are fighting for public and free education!\n  </b>\n  It is all of us a duty to support these mobilizations, against government repression and terrorism.\n  <b>\n   Because the right to studies without class barriers concerns the whole people!\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Down the hands from the Health Center of Nea Ionia!\n  </b>\n  They have already kicked out the EOPYY pharmacy, sending it to Agia Paraskevi.

A place of discussion and organization of our struggle. We are fighting for the creation of outbreaks of resistance in our neighborhoods.\n  <b>\n   For popular organization and initiatives for mobilization on the labor-solid claims!\n  </b>\n  Against the logic of managing jointly with its system and local factors and mechanisms. Against the delusions that elections are changing things for the better.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The rage that fills us with increased accounts, wages - crumbs, unemployment, depreciation of our lives, become a fight power!\n  <b>\n   Only with our own organization, with action, resistance and claiming our rights will we see better days!\n  </b>\n  We have nothing to expect from any Savior except to get the situation in our hands!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   We invite you to get to know each other, to find ourselves on the streets of our neighborhoods, to fight together!\n  </b>\n  You will find us in the central squares and roads, outside the ISAP stations, in the popular markets, in the small and large neighborhood struggles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And online:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Blog:\n  <a href=\"http://antistasistavoreia.blogspot.com\">\n   antistasistavoreia.blogspot.com\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mail:\n  <a href=\"mailto:antistasistavoreia@gmail.com\">\n   antistasistavoreia@gmail.com\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Facebook:\n  <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555879769271\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Resistance to the north\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Instagram:\n  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/antistasi_sta_voreia/\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Resistance_T_ABorea\n  </a>\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"536\" data-original-width=\"822\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMeC9dd19ZwmZ17Xz5bwDeYw6PIqWtz7oJoRxdARQAExmK03idnTZPOFelR7Pv3LiQdUmOkkGB23fFzBPoKunQHsK-4RMZCmqFuCFDc7hJGkUUdPkfNWBIlrhyfdnZYUSCdV0bF157IYGAz-HtL6hqROufRy0oLSSPqSM1RPWrBsTAKnTM_XAGjlWqkJA/s320/logo-whitebg.png\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMeC9dd19ZwmZ17Xz5bwDeYw6PIqWtz7oJoRxdARQAExmK03idnTZPOFelR7Pv3LiQdUmOkkGB23fFzBPoKunQHsK-4RMZCmqFuCFDc7hJGkUUdPkfNWBIlrhyfdnZYUSCdV0bF157IYGAz-HtL6hqROufRy0oLSSPqSM1RPWrBsTAKnTM_XAGjlWqkJA/s320/logo-whitebg.png\" width=\"320\"/>\n </div>\n <br/>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div>\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u0392\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1", "\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2", "\u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03ae\u03bb\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/2.html"}
