The 148 hectares ground has been abandoned so far, except for offensive real estate speculation that threaten the entire natural means of the terrain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The indigenous people published a letter in full in which they announced the resumption and denounced Incra for the stoppage process of land demarcation of the Guarani-Mmby\u00e1. They required the clinging of the closure of these processes and also the demarcation of Teko\u00e1 Nhe'engatu, but made it clear that they will not wait for the conclusion of the bureaucracies to actually resume the lands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   \u201c\n  </em>\n  It is not fair to see our children are born and grow in a situation of profound vulnerability, with no prospect of a quiet, fair and healthy life. We spent our years in makeshift houses - Tables - Landless shacks to plant our fields, without drinking water to drink, without weeds, and we don't even have a place to build our Oxy, Pray House.
