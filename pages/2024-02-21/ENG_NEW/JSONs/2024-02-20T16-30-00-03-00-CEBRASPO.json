As usual, houses were invaded without a court term\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n   Citizens do not have to accept in good man to live under this hell. Nothing justifies exposing workers, children and the elderly to this risk of death. Much less supposed to recover thefts, well materials from large insurance companies.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n   It is not just Claudio Castro to blame for these slaughter.
