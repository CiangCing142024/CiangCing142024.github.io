  The working element is essential for women. Why? In the centers 
 anti -violence, all the operators of the centers that collect say so 
 The testimonies of women who turn to them, many of these 
 women in saying: I am suffering violence from my husband, 
 They add: but how can I get rid if I don't even have a job, 
 If I don't have the strength to organize an alternative future to this 
 submission. And therefore work to women is fundamental for 
 Being able to decide to break violent relationships. Gender violence yes 
 begins to contrast by giving economic power to women, the work is 
 fundamental for his freedom of choice.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Then, if 
 We analyze the data of the women inserted in the world of work, the 
 Italian percentages are truly fearful; Compared to all the 
 rest of Europe we are occupied for 20% less and is one 
 very high percentage. The 73% figure of young women who 
 abandon jobs because they cannot reconcile 
 Work and family is aberrant, it is dangerous, it is a social alarm. 
 Without considering the remuneration difference, which this is 
 Another fundamental struggle. That is, it is absurd that a woman should 
 be paid less even to the same task. The data on 
 difference of remuneration - INPS data - they say that if the salary 
 average of a worker in Italy is â‚¬ 22,000 per year, women 
 they earn 8,000 less now.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Femicide is 
 Only the pinnacle of the pyramid, but the pyramid also starts from these 
 discrimination, from these stereotypes, from these submissions that 
 We women suffer.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Then, if it binds 
 The fight against gender violence at the cultural question - that 
 there is no doubt, and here you have to start from kindergarten where they apply 
 still stereotypes: do not cry like a girl, pink 
 of the girl ... stereotypes that we women suffer and that it is right 
 that are demolished with education, with culture, since 
 primary school - it is also true, however, that you have to fight for e 
 at work, on the discrimination that women suffer in the place of 
 Work. We have to fight against the fact that women come 
 first fired that some employers, as happened 
 For the workers of Mottola's weaving, they say: I prefer not 
 take women, etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  If we don't have 
 work we will never reach freedom, because "freedom" 
 In a capitalist society it passes through money and money 
 It is power.

 of the Council made the end of year conference when he had the

  At that point I wondered: but it was possible that there was not one 
 Journalist who raised himself at that moment? Had been me 
 Present I would have overturned the table and I would have said: but you think that 
 Most women have an economic situation like 
 They, that is, an economic power? How do you allow yourself to think that 
 We all live in that golden condition? Most 
 of us women must fight daily for a job that gives us 
 dignity. But nobody said anything.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  In recent times 
 It seems that everything we have achieved with a strong struggle, that 
 It starts from the 70s, it's as if they are eroding them.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The clear example 
 It is that of the right of abortion. The last initiative comes from Modena, 
 A city not a small village village in the South. Here they were 
 authorized "40 days of prayer" in front of the hospital, 
 where a group of women start praying for the 
 women who go to abort and have to pray for the fetuses who do 
 "They will go to hell." In the 70s such a thing does not 
 It would have come to anyone, or we would have organized, 
 We would go to focus on them, that is, we would have scared them. 
 While now not only do it, but have been authorized.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This means that 
 slowly all those freedoms we have reached are 
 eroding.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  And when one 
 Prime Minister allows himself to compare a woman who 
 works, a worker who must do many sacrifices to be able to 
 put together the work, the family, the management of everything, to one 
 rich president of the EU Commission, in the face of these things he must 
 come out our anger. Also considering that in the maneuver 
 budget, Meloni has removed a lot of money from nursery schools, has 
 also removed the bonuses against the companies they assumed 
 young women. Even the mom bonus, who gave it to? To women who 
 They have three children. But in percentages they give them with three children are the 
 6%... they are eroding there everything.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Not one less has 
 had the strength, we must recognize it, that we have collected all 
 anger towards gender violence, but snubbing 
 This working aspect is just a mistake, because it is really 
 through the work that the woman acquires dignity and has a voice in 
 more, it can think of an alternative future to a man who uses 
 violence against him. The work makes us strong, autonomous and 
 therefore a work strike was rightly called to give 
 A proletarian sense, class to this March 8th. And I'm 
 very gradually with the choice you have made to get to the eight 
 March placing the reality of working women at the center.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  One last thing on 
 This slow daily erosion of rights - a dangerous symptom, 
 Because all authoritarian regimes insinuate themselves in this way, 
 subtracting rights - a few days ago the League made a proposal 
 of the law that should prohibit the manifestations that have as their purpose 
 to demonstrate in favor of Palestine. To me another time 
 He would take a table and overturn it in the face. But how do you 
 Do you allow? The freedom of manifestation of thought is guaranteed 
 from our Constitution. The mere fact that they think of these 
 proposals is dangerous, because it means that they can do it, that yes 
 they feel authorized to do it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Another thing he does 
 Raising anger is the number of feminicides, which is not a data 
 statistical. We already know how many women will die. The last one 
 murder was made by a financier with his gun of 
 order. It is not so much talked about but in the new package 
 security certainly to the police has been given the 
 possibility not only to hold the gun of order, but also 
 Another private gun. That is, they are transforming the company into 
 something different than the one that had been designed by 
 Constitution, that is, a sceriffi company. Who is part of the 
 law enforcement, therefore, has the right to hold two weapons, one 
 order and the other private. It's a very serious thing! At the same 
 so that a parliamentarian went to visit prison is 
 scandalized of the fact that there was a prisoner with a child of a 
 month. But what you scandalize if you have with the safety package 
 Authorized yourself this!? That is, if first a woman who had a 
 child under three years old or was pregnant had the right to 
 serve his sentence under house arrest, with the security package 
 This rule has been removed. Because they wanted to attack Roma women 
 who according to the League make theft and then invoke the fact of having 
 of children and do not go to prison ... then because you scandalized 
 that there is a one month in prison if you are yourself ad 
 approve such a law?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is outlining 
 A different, frightening society. Because between the security package, 
 the Caivano decree, the bill for the "eco -overrixs", and others 
 anti -construction law proposals that also say how we need to 
 demonstrate, for what reasons - for this reason and for that no - 
 with all the repression in place - now let's see in all 
 demonstrations this police in anti -Somamossa estate ready to 
 eat anyone, where there are only people who want 
 demonstrate, there is to worry.
