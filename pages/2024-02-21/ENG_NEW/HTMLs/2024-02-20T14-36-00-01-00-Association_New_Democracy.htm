    Protests against "reforms" or measures 
 EU agrarian, which show the contradictions, among those above, which 
 They develop in collusion and struggle, which causes the application of 
 measures or "reform" of the common agrarian policy of the EU (PAC) of 1962, to 
 serve the strategic interests of imperialist countries, which make up

    But, the contradiction of true 
 farmers - the agrarian workers and the peasants - against their exploiters, 
 although relegated in the media by the agrarian crisis, it develops and is a 
 objective fact that the increase in the price of food products collides 
 against the mass of consumer of the countryside and the city, most of which 
 They are the workers; as is also a fact that the taxes allocated to 
 Agricultural subsidies for large monopolists are part of the 
 plusvalia that capitalists extract from the exploitation of the proletariat and 
 This encourages contradictions. Agricultural grants and policy of 
 EU prices favors capitalist landowners and large 
 capitalists in the imperialist countries of the EU and the semi -feudal landowners 
 and great bourgeoisie in the semicolonial countries within the EU. The claims for 
 Subsidies and agricultural prices are against the proletariat.
