   . After the 1964 military coup, Alipio did not abandon the fight and went on to clandestinity. He even lived in Cuba, where he planned his return to Brazil. Back in the country, he was arrested in 1970 and was brutally tortured by the gorillas of the military regime. Torture did not heat it. In the 1980s, he worked in Agricultural Cooperatives of Mozambique, at the time directed by the then revolutionary Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo) and, until his death, Alipio continued active in political militancy. In 2010, he participated in an expanded meeting of the Poor Peasant League Commission in Goiânia, and in the same year joined the Editorial Board of

We will live a new wave of the proletarian revolution. May we be together! And we tell them that the verses in honor of Palestinian resistance have the inspiration of our president of honor.
