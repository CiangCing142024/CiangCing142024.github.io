    There 
 We want to finish once with the words: "Fatality", 
 "Culture of security" (which is then overthrown on 
 workers)? Deny safety in the workplace together with 
 precarious contracts, at low wages, at black work: they are all 
 Conditions that prepare mortal accidents! As murders 
 premeditated.

 <p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

    What 
 Have you led to this worker massacre? There are more than 30 companies of 
 subcontracting in the same construction site that means undersular, absence 
 of training, building taken as metalworkers because the masters 
 So they save costs. And this occurs in all contracts, 
 also in factories with "multiservices" contracts, with 
 false cooperatives that only serve to divide workers for better 
 exploit them within the system created by the masters, by 
 Stellantis, at the former Ilva, at Marcegaglia, at the warehouses of the 
 logistics, in the railways, on construction sites.

  <span face="Arial, sans-serif">
   <span>
    There 
 Client company of the Site Assassino di Firenze is of the former 
 Minister Alfano and is the same as the accident in Genoa in 2023 in 
 A construction site always for a Esselunga supermarket in San Benigno where 3 
 workers were injured.

 <p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

    There 
 they are precise responsibilities and that is why we call the masters 
 Assassins!

 <p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <span face="Arial, sans-serif">
   <span>
    AND 
 How to call this government of the owners - the Meloni government - that 
 More than the other governments of the masters is deployed exclusively on 
 their interests, their profits?
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <span face="Arial, sans-serif">
   <span>
    The 
 Meloni government with the reform of the Salvini procurement code - 
 which provides for the "cascade subcontracting" - has given the green light to the 
 subcontracting, to the custody of the works even without a tender, eliminating 
 the constraints of the companies that to make more useful cut the costs of the 
 safety, contracts, workers' rights; cuts that 
 Especially in construction sites mean accidents, dead.

   <span>
    So 
 What is the "Minister of Business Consultants" about when 
 with "deep condolence" announces further interventions of the 
 government?

  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <span face="Arial, sans-serif">
   <span>
    Not 
 It is perhaps to encourage black work when she, the minister of 
 masters of this government, Marina Calderone, intends to insert the 
 amnesty on social security contributions evaded by companies in 
 Package that wants to bring to the Council of Ministers? This 
 minister even eliminated the penalties for the corporals, rules 
 provided by the anti submerged plan of the Draghi government! To companies that 
 they violate the rules at work and also on safety and health come 
 denied bonuses and regulatory benefits. But if these companies do 
 "Regularize", the bonuses come back! The minister says nothing and nothing 
 It does to increase inspectors and controls! It's the same 
 Minister who cut the amounts paid by the support fund 
 for the families of the victims of serious accidents at work (the 
 minimum from 6 thousand to 4 thousand euros and the maximum from 22,400 to 14,500 
 EUR)!

    There is 
 need to combine all those who really commit themselves to this 
 front, by the basic and class unions that fight every every 
 day for the security and workers' rights - while i

 workers at work, instead they collaborate with companies, to the RLS 
 combatives, as well as work inspectors, the students who do

    Yes 
 He wants to understand that it is a necessary struggle that must aim for the causes 
 of the deaths at work which is the system of the killers and the 
 governments that represent them and that the reversal of this power 
 who is based on profit is the only true and real defense of life 
 of the workers? The work itself does not kill, it is the profit of the masters 
 who kills!
