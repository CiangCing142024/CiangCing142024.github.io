 Crowds gathered today, 29/3/24, from 9am outside the Athens Court of Appeal for the issuance of the ruling of the Joint Court of Justice regarding the 12 -year -old case by Kolonos. With slogans and banners, the policy that generates and nourishes the social middle age has been denounced, hatches and conceals rapists and mastrians, who are inherent in violence, oppression and exploitation. The KKE (M-L) was intervened with banners, notice and slogans.

  The popular anger and condemnation that has been expressed all the time - and especially after the prosecutor's vulgar proposal - created pressure and played a decisive role in the decision made. The mother of 12 -year -old Christina, in addition to attempts to blame, was found innocent of all the heavy crimes he was accused of. This is a very important victory. While Michos was convicted of all offenses, including rape and mastrian, but was found innocent of the category of trafficking (trafficking).
 </p>
<p>
  We have no illusion about the class "law" served by bourgeois, so -called justice. After all, it is certain that there will be a second instance trial, where it is a constant tactic to decrease or even eliminate first degree penalties. For workers, the people and the youth are culprits and will be the capitalist system, their bourgeois governments and their policies, their rotten expressors. Courts and prosecutors are bodies with a specific role. They will not give up on this role, to serve and acquit the rotten.
 </p>
<p>
  The mobilizations and the complaint against the initially attempt to conceal, in view of the second instance of the case, must continue, be massaged and strengthened. Having targeted, not only those who rush, exploit and murder, but the rotten socio -economic system that generates and shapes these behaviors itself. The right of the poor and exploited people is won on the way of the race!

    The main countries involved in the 
 Supply of weapons and military assets in Israel are the United States, Germany, 
 Italy and the United Kingdom. This document outlines the sites connected to the 
 production for the Israeli army in different countries and, where possible,

   Our 
 goal is to provide a resource for actions that aim for production 
 or the transport of military assets, or who interrupt the activity of suppliers 
 military of Israel, and also to connect resources that can be used 
 to act in particular countries.

   Our 
 research identifies companies that produce some of the most fundamental weapons 
 for the Israeli army, including Lockheed Martin (main contractor for 
 F35 combat jet), Boeing (producer of many of the guided weapons 
 used by the Israeli army), Bae Systems (a leading supplier for 
 the F35), Leonardo (part of the coalition F35) and Raytheon (producer of the 
 Paveway guided bomb).

   The action is 
 possible in different forms: while we identify direct production sites 
 For the Israeli army, it is also possible to target multinationals 
 that produce for Israel even if military assets are produced in another 
 site. In the same way, it is possible to target the companies involved in the 
 transport of military materials in Israel.
   <br>
<br>
   The production of weapons is highly international and many of the chains of 
 more traceable supply concern goods such as combat planes 
 made by international coalitions. These aircraft are fundamental for

   The actor 
 key in maritime transport from the United States - and other parts of the world - 
 towards Israel is the Zim Navigation Company. Zim is the main supplier 
 shipping services in Israel and one of the top ten larger 
 Navigation companies in the world. Previously controlled by the government 
 Israeli, Zim has been privatized and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 
 last two decades. Despite this, it still maintains close ties with the state 
 Israeli and is essential to guarantee logistical support to the state e

   The majority 
 part of the military components enters and leaves the United States through i 
 ports of the eastern coast, mainly New York/Newark, Savannah, 
 Charleston and the port of Virginia. These ports are generally 
 unionized by the International Longshoremen's Association, or Ila. This

   With access 
 To the US commercial data, it is possible to see the individual shipments 
 through their "load policies", the documents used by 
 Navigation companies to identify shipments and keep track of 
 delivery models. In rare cases, this may include the transport of weapons on 
 civil ships. For example, on March 4, 2023 an expedition of "newspapers, rocket

 of Virginia or via Liverpool in Charleston.

   On March 23, at the call of the "friends of the commune 42", took place in Saint-Etienne a demonstration celebrating the town of Paris in 1871. This call was placed and read in terms of the current situation, that is to say from walking to war, reaction, the reactions of the bourgeoisie to the general crisis of imperialism whose weight rests entirely on the shoulders of the people, and mainly in the light of the revolutionary development movement worldwide.
  </p>
<p>
   Thus, the call echoed widely, receiving the support and signing of the Revolutionary Youth League (LJR), young revolutionaries (JR), of the Communist Renaissance pole (PRCF), of the Federation Jeunes Insoumis 42, of the LFI deputy of the Loire, of the local section of the French Communist Party, (PCF) of the Libertarian Communist Union, Rebbelion extinction of Libre Pensée, of the SELA Syndicate of Grenoble and Lyon, of the campaign Unitary for the release of Georges Abdallah, of the local section of EELV, friends of the commune of Paris 1871, or of the newspaper La Cause du Peuple and our own media, new era.
  </p>
<p>
   At 2 p.m., the red flags, the flag of the Universal Republic proclaimed on March 18, 1871, began to flourish on the Place du Peuple, alongside the flags of the signatory organizations and some flags of the CGT. After a speech by the "Friends of Commune 42" exposing the importance of this event and rejoicing at the broad unity around the call, the procession, gathering more than 80 participants, began to sing slogans taken up by the megaphones scattered throughout the demonstration, and by the demonstrators: "The Commune is immortal, let's go back to the assault of the sky",  or "Beware of revenge, when all the poor get involved".
  </p>
<p>
   We have also heard the slogans "Palestine will live, Palestine will defeat", "long live the armed struggle of the Palestinian people" from an intervention by an LJR activist recalling that one cannot speak of the Paris Commune, That is to say of the struggle for the emancipation of the human race, not to mention the glorious national liberation struggle which ignites Palestine and the whole Middle East. The procession has also sung "French state is not our state, all the power to the proletariat", connecting the national and revolutionary liberation struggles around the world in the battle for the power of the proletariat.
  </p>
<p>
   The "Gaza United" collective, founded by residents of the Montreynaud district, took part in the demonstration and its animation, accompanied by a drum and forcefully repeating all the slogans. The demonstrators ended up shouting: "Long live the armed struggle of the peoples of the world", echoing the "Macron, Macron, we will never give up the cannons!" [Editor's note: The Paris Commune was triggered when the Parisian proletariat refused to return to the bourgeois army the cannons with which the Montmartre hill was equipped and decided to equip itself with them, endowing the proletariat with an army, the National Guard – the backbone of any state].
  </p>
<p>
   The words have punctuated the demonstration, recalling the heroism of the communards and the communards, of the Palestinian fighters, and of all those who fight for a new world, rid of imperialism. Rather than celebrating a past date, the demonstration was actually an opportunity to highlight those that the LJR activists call "the sons and daughters of the Immortelle Commune de Paris", that is to say those who These are today on the side of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples around the world. In front of the town hall of Saint-Etienne, close to the prefecture where the town of Saint-Etienne was proclaimed 153 years ago, is sung by the procession the International, the anthem of the workers, accompanied by the slogan "L 'French State is not our state, all the power in the proletariat! ».
  </p>
<p>
   The demonstration ends at Cuit Couriot in front of the entrance to the old disused mine. The representative of the "Friends of the Commune 42" announces the end of the demonstration before the mine, symbol of the power of the Stéphanoise working class, which has notably risen during the insurrectional strikes of 1948.
  </p>
<p>
   Several speeches follow one another, the LJR, the PRCF and the Gaza United collective, before a moment of exchange between activists of different political and unions, in a friendly and fraternal atmosphere.

On March 18, 1871, the official governance dominated by the bourgeoisie tried to seize the cannons of the Butte Montmartre the goal was to disarm the Parisian people organized in the National Guard. It was the rocking point of a long process that has been spread since Sedan's defeat in 1870. The Parisian proletariat decided to take charge and refused to give his guns. This grandiose act was the beginning of an experience that would forever marked the epic of the class struggle. From a humiliating national defeat, it turned into a torch of human emancipation, it revealed for good what class is the true engine of history. During 100 days Paris did not derogate in its glorious title of cradle of the Revolution. The weapon people organized the first workers 'power in history, and the first workers' republic in France. Faced with enemies from inside and outside the Paris proletariat trembled the basics of the old world. If we are here to bring together it is not to commemorate a dead date but to celebrate a living experience which must inspire us in our struggles to transform the old world into a crisis. The town carries in it a part of the responses of our time. The fight of modern classes in France is a long continuum whose premises is with the emergence of the people in public affairs during the great bourgeois revolution of 1789. The revolutionary wars, the lifting of the year II, the committee of Hi public entered the popular classes and the nascent proletariat in politics definitively, it will not come out of it. As early as 1789, the question of economic equality took precedence over political freedom. It was the beginning of the great misunderstanding between the people who hear equality as a society of economic justice and the bourgeois who speak only of equality before the laws. The freedom of the bourgeois is that of undertaking and putting the channels at the foot of the workers, that of the proletarian means that he no longer has a chain. In 1848 everything changed definitively, the bourgeois fraternity dissipated in cannon shots against the barricades. During these glorious days in June 1848, the workers rebelled for an egalitarian "social republic". Since then, as K.Marx has taught us, France is divided into two "nationsantagonics", that of the bourgeois, the expropriator of wealth, and that of the producers, the proletariat. Since the days of June 1848 France experienced a long civil war sometimes open and warm, sometimes masked and of low intensity. . The town only confirmed this truth. All political and social news in recent years confirm, of course, all this. That we thought of the uprising of the neighborhoods in 2005, the yellow vests and, of course, this June 2023 fire. Here we have the real movement of quest for equality that the people have been looking for since 1789. Quest of equality always violently violently Repeated by the State serving the masters of the Stock Exchange and Trusts and all the parasites of the Old World. Our victory meaning their disappearance as a class. So we recall this this March 18, 1871 the daring people refused to return the canons and went to the assault of heaven! In fact a new state was born. On March 26, the elections declared the town of Paris. On March 28, the commune was proclaimed, it was the official birth of the first working -class Republic of history, which seceded the Versaillaise Republic because it was there that it was the bourgeois government. A symbol! Two powers coexist absolutely opposed, it is the civil war in fact. That same day the national flag becomes the red flag, the international is the anthem of this new state. On the 30th, the municipality suppressed the conscription and the permanent army and proclaimed the National Guard, of which all valid citizens were to be part, as the only army force. There was no more army cut off from society but the people in arms in the National Guard. There was no longer the power above the masses but the power proletariat in an armed sea of the masses. <br/><br/>  The same day, foreigners elected to the town were confirmed in their functions, because "the flag of the commune is that of the Universal Republic". The Russian Elisabeth Dmitrieff was the leader of one of the first organization of a mass woman in history: "Women's Union for the Defense of Paris and care for the wounded". The women until the last moment were on the barricades and participated in the organization of production. The latest press release from the Union of Women during the conquest of Paris by the Versaillais was a brief and powerful "all to the barricades!" The defense of Paris was entrusted to a Pole: Jarosław Dąbrowski. Imagine the Military Directorate of Paris entrusted to a stranger and the organization of women to a foreigner. At that time all the oppressed in the world were Parisians. We are far from this Republic which removes the law of the soil and chases and embodies the undocumented. Concretely, all of the power was under workers' control. The administration was depoliticized to simply become an instrument at the service of everyone. All charges were revocable and under popular control. The economy was starting to be reorganized in a federated cooperative. The municipality is a paradigm car antithesis of the Republic of bankers, monopolists, militarists we know. It is administration of public affairs by the greatest number, it is control of the police by citizens. It is the political power of the majority imposed on the minority of Parasite, while today we live the dictatorship of a minority of parasite on the majority. She is women in the Directorate of Collective Affairs, while today women are only an alibi in governments. It is the universal fraternity in the face of the wars of imperialist rapine. It is, above all, already more than a half-state when the current one only strengthens, than reaction. It is the settlement of all people's problems by people themselves. It is the beginning of the resolution of the latent civil war and the division. It is a source of unit. So yes, all of us, we have to restore his immense potential to project ourselves into the future to imagine. We can already with the town know what a new France might look like. It is therefore not a question of fighting for a life republic which would change nothing in the background but for a second republic, a second commune, bright and powerful, which would return the country and sound the death knell of the division between work and the capital. Obviously all this is only carried out by a revolutionary break, the National Assembly is and will always be the instrument of the Versaillais it cannot be otherwise. This is why we, daughters and sons of the immortal commune, we affirm today that any emancipatory policy can only go through the reissue of the town! We would like to finish our speaking by quoting the statutes of the second international which seems to us the prerequisite for any emancipatory dream: "In its fight against the unified power of the possessed classes, the proletariat can not act as class as By constituting themselves as a political party and by opposing all the ancient political parties created by the possessing classes. This constitution of the proletariat in political parties is essential to ensure the triumph of the social revolution and its supreme goal: the abolition of classes . So yes, we are the daughters and sons of the town of Paris and we swear to re-edit it! Long live the Universal Republic of workers!</p></div>

  </b>
  AT ELEFTHERIAS PARK -
  <b>
   COURSE
  </b>
  To the US -Israel Embassies!
 </p>
<p>
  The open war fronts in the world continue without finishing. From Ukraine to Palestine, the peoples of the peoples continues. Hundreds of thousands are dead and crushed. Hundreds of thousands are the ones who have been forced on the road to refugee, hunger and total misery.
  <b>
   And developments are even worse.
  </b>
  Young, huge dangers threaten the peoples of our region, but also of the whole planet, as the competitions between the imperialists, the great powers of the planet, are even more fierce.
 </p>
<p>
  The unjust war on
  <b>
   Ukraine
  </b>
  , in the heart of Europe, not only does not show signs of expansion, but on the contrary it is even more complicated. Not only any of the imperialists who started and entangled in this war (USA - Russia - EU) is not in the mood to back down, but events such as the recent terrorist attack in Moscow, herald a new cycle of blood, intensity of the confrontation and possibly transportation her in new battlefields and competition.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   At the same time, in the headquarters of the imperialist forces, war rhetoric is upgraded to all levels, looking like preparation of a war -free war for the whole planet.
  </b>
  There is now an open debate about the possibility of a 3rd World War. Everyone's threats continue to use nuclear. The economies and production of EU countries are adapted to support a war orientation. And the peoples are prepared by their governments for the prospect of becoming meat for the cannons already set up. As in Germany, where the Minister of Education suggested schools prepare students for the possibility of war !!! And all this has long been a science fiction scenarios, but images of the present and - mainly - of the future that the imperialists are preparing for peoples.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   The horrible picture of the present is the slaughter of the heroic Palestinian people by the state-tromocrat who continues without stopping!
  </b>
  Tens of thousands are dead throughout the Gaza Strip of the ruthless Israeli pounding over the last five months, while hunger and thirst are reaping those who manage to survive. The blows have long been expanded to the West Bank, while new daily targets are food warehouses, food distribution points, hospitals and refugee camps. The forthcoming invasion of Rafa foreshadows a new expansion of the massacre, with the aim of completely expanding the Palestinians from their place and at the same time accumulates terms and dangers of a more comprehensive ignition in the Middle East region.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   Our country is increasingly involved in the war games of the region.
  </b>
  The New Democracy government, as a representative of the dependent local ruling class, offers "land and water" to its imperialist masters and to promote their blood-soaked plans in the region. The dispatch of the frigate "Hydra" to the Red Sea, the conversion of Larissa into a command post for military operations, the use of the entire country as a base for murderers, both towards Ukraine and the Middle East, prove the deepening of the country's involvement in the war fronts and at the same time pose the people of our country in front of enormous dangers.
  <b>
   They are preparing our people and the peoples of the area, to become meat for the canons of war and imperialist competitions. Only the peoples can block their plans!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Against this climate of war our people must give their own militant response:
  <b>
   To form a wide, mass anti-war-anti-imperialist movement against the policy of barbarism.
  </b>
  In the same way that students and peasants rose up. In the same way that people and youth rose up against crime in Tempe.
  <b>
   In the same way that is massively expressed all over the world
  </b>
  Solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and who must continue more massively and more decisively in our country.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   The black anniversary for the 75th anniversary of the founding of NATO, the largest war machine on the planet, to be the occasion of massive demonstrations of solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and against war and imperialism!

<p>
  8 March, International Working Women’s Day, is now behind us. We realise that those who “keep 8 March alive” have a very blurred consciousness. This blurred consciousness has led them to call 8 March “Women’s Day” or “Working Women’s Day”. Apart from the possibility of using this name as a tactic to be ” inclusive “, we will deal with the revisionist line that we see concretely; because the struggle against revisionism is in favour of our revolution and will help to find the right line. This struggle involves not only the destruction of the enemy, but also our own development. We must constantly struggle to seek, uncover, defend and overcome the truth so that the revolutionary line can win the victory. We must not forget for a moment that those who take responsibility for creating and spreading the revolutionary line are not free from regression and the problems that lead to it.
 </p>
<p>
  In the revolutionary women’s organisations, especially in the last 10 years, we can say that feminist attitudes, sometimes shy and sometimes bold, have gained importance. These attitudes, visible from declarations to slogans and banners, have “now” gone beyond the level of a tendency, and a sexist standpoint has begun to replace the class standpoint. The scientific nature of this standpoint, which is legitimised by the term “women’s standpoint”, is never discussed. The righteous rebellion of the oppressed woman is reduced to the level of a reproach that fits into the order. From the bourgeois woman’s point of view, partnership is not perceived as a class problem. Since the ideological struggle against feminism is advised, this process has developed into support for the feminist movement, which follows it or does not follow it and gradually becomes similar to it.
 </p>
<p>
  In this process of development, in which we are also involved with sometimes strong and sometimes weak discussions, the revolutionary women’s movement in Turkey has lost ideological and political power. While the women’s movement is developing, while the oppression of women in every respect is being put on the agenda and problematised by a broad section of people, we are confronted with the reality that the revolutionary women’s movement has lost power. Our “minority position” within the women’s organisations and our inability to ensure unity within ourselves have paved the way for this; the concealment of our identity, our class attitude, which gives us strength, has made us immobile. When will we claim our blocked identity?
 </p>
<p>
  If a revolutionary woman has to hide her “revolutionary” identity on 25 November or 8 March, can we say that women are represented there, or can they really express themselves? It is inevitable to discuss this problematic existence of the revolutionary women’s movement, which has become clear in recent times.
 </p>
<p p="">

<em>
<strong>
      A STRANGE WAR
     </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
    The guilt of the thief will surely come to light; in this article we will deal with the landlord. While the women’s organisations that call themselves revolutionary leave the question of women’s emancipation to other issues, they seem to have jettisoned what they stand for. Many women’s organisations openly accept the line of feminism. In any case, what we expect from these organisations is nothing more than the way they currently express themselves. The problem lies with those who claim not to be feminists: conformity leads to uniformity and ultimately rejection of the revolutionary line. The reason why we and some other women’s organisations like ours are ‘marginal’ is because they are unable to ‘become the same’, not out of incompetence of course, but because of the revolutionary tradition on which they are based and the class attitude from which they feed.
   </p>
<p>
    If we look at the declarations of the Democratic Women’s Movement (DWL) and the right-wing liquidation group on 8 March, we come across the “unbearable lightness” of not even being able to call 8 March “International Working Women’s Day”. We can judge this situation as “confusion” or “keyboard hypocrisy”, let’s judge it as such and move on. In the statement of the DWL entitled “We are in revolt against war, poverty, massacre of women” and the word “war” in the title, we could not find any sentence in the content. With this approach, we see that 8 March is only being condensed into identity politics. We understand that the statement read out by comrade Barbara Anna Kistler on 8 March ’92 has been erased from memory, let us remind you: “Contrary to what feminists say, the women’s question is inseparable from the class question.”
   </p>
<p p="">
<p>
     The bourgeois movements recognise war as “men’s work”. Unjust wars also serve to enforce, consolidate and maintain male domination. In unjust wars, women are massively attacked, enslaved, captured, emigrated, sold on slave markets, subjected to the worst tortures and raped. Women’s resistance to war is revolutionary when its main target is unjust wars. Women do not have to be the trampled grass on which the elephants trample!
    </p>
<p>
     Women who take sides in just wars say that they develop and liberate themselves in war. Gül Kaya (Nergiz) says, “When it comes to war, a field symbolised by men, our work becomes even more difficult,” and she advises women to free themselves from the vines that entwine their feet. Gamzegül Kaya (Ekin) captures the reality where she says: “My reasons to fight are increasing day by day. For this reason, we will continue to participate in just wars against imperialist-unjust wars. We “want to fight wherever there is life”. This approach, which restricts women to certain combat zones, is very dangerous. Women, who are part of humanity, must fight tirelessly in all areas for the liberation of humanity.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
       UNITY FOR WHAT?
      </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     We often see these comrades joining a bourgeois group, current or movement. We catch them insisting on associations based only on “power” by talking about “the greatest possible unity”. We know that a multitude of people without a goal of power is not power. You cannot be strong if you consider practices that are not aimed at power to be the “elixir of life”.
    </p>
<p>
     In the attempt to react to the process, the deviations to the right and the left show themselves in different forms. Action alliances have begun to lead to ideological alliances because the mechanisms of criticism are not sincere and the level itself is slippery!
    </p>
<p>
     Without taking the unity of labouring women and the unity of women from the oppressed classes as a basis, revisionism will be the goal. On the other hand, the development of the unity of action of revolutionary women’s organisations will open the way for a revolutionary approach to women’s liberation.
    </p>
<p p="">
<p>
      No form of revisionism is innocent. The demand for disorganisation is not a call for protection and freedom for “individual women”. On the contrary, it is about protecting traditional individualism, and it is fuelled entirely by the narrow interests of those who make this demand, who have a place in this order. Of course we will go along with them, of course we will listen to them. We will do this without giving up to develop our own line, without neglecting the responsibility to develop the right line, and without forgetting that the need for unity arises from the aim of making the great revolutionary war victorious.

  In February 2024, the Interior Minister Darmanin announced that Emmanuel Macron wanted it to “be no longer possible to become French if you are not a child of French parents” if one was born on Mayotte.
 </p>
<p>
  In the general context of the immigration law, where jus soli [latin for right of the soil, a bourgeois principle according to which nationality is determined by the place of birth] was already called into question before the censorship of the Constitutional Council (for technical and non -political reasons), it is necessary to look at this decision to draw consequences on the reactionarization of the bourgeois State (see our previous issue).
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<em>
   Jus soli
  </em>
  , a principle that has become important for the French bourgeoisie
 </h3>
<p>
  With regard to nationality, the French bourgeoisie has evolved over time, following the development of French capitalism.
 </p>
<p>
  The great French revolution of 1789 installed the bourgeoisie in control. With the first constitutional monarchy (1791), there is a form of
  <em>
   Juice Soli
  </em>
  which is confirmed after the end of the revolution in the Napoleon code of 1804. But this
  <em>
   Juice Soli
  </em>
  is conditional, it cannot be said that it is particularly a principle established by the French bourgeoisie, it is rarely used.
 </p>
<p>
  It was in 1851, then in 1889 that the legislation fixed the
  <em>
   Juice Soli
  </em>
  strongly in French law. Why? This is the time when French capitalism needs workforce and cannot rely only on the ancient peasants, who do not arrive quickly enough in the cities or died in successive wars. It is therefore necessary to get immigrants that will be sought in Italy, Spain, Belgium… Thus we note for example that in 1889, when the new law arrives, it was almost 20 years since 1870-71, time of the Franco-Prussian war and the Commune; There will therefore necessarily be absence in the age groups which must perform military service, because their potential parents died in war. The law of that year will reflect this reality to force the majority of young children of foreigners to do military service.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, in the turning point towards imperialism which happens around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, France became the main country of immigration in Europe while restricting nationality in its new colonies where one does not become French as in mainland France (Indigennat’s code of 1881). This will continue with the infamous example of the name “French Muslims” in Algeria, which accompanies so many massacres and persecutions. You have to keep it in mind to always remember how French imperialism is used to treating those it designates foreign on “its” soil.
 </p>
<p>
  We can thus say that from the beginning of its contemporary history (because it also existed in another way under the old regime), the
  <em>
   Juice Soli
  </em>
  evolved in France (and elsewhere in the colonies) according to the necessities of capitalism, and then of French imperialism. It opened when there was a need for workforce, and then closed. But it has become a general principle of the law of the French bourgeoisie, an instrument by which it could control its population in all the bourgeois regimes to follow since the 1
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  Republic. Consequently, it’s worth noting that its questioning in Mayotte, and then in France in general (which is the position of Ciotti’s Republicans and has been the historic position of the RN since Le Pen’s father) is met with almost no complaints. On the contrary, this “solution” is sold to masses as a solution to the problems of Mayotte. It is a sign of the reactionarization of the State, because the long-standing legal tradition of bourgeois democracy in France is called into question for the first time in an intense way since the so-called “decolonization” and since the regime of Vichy, who had returned to the naturalization obtained “by the soil” with his fascist government of deportations.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  The negation of French bourgeois democratic principles beyond
  <em>
   Juice Soli
  </em>
</h3>
<p>
  The French bourgeoisie has always boasted of being the heir of the Enlightenment, of the great Ideas, traditions of freedom and human rights. All of this nonsense has taken a life of its own when we see the ferocious exploitation and inhuman measures taken over the last 175 years by the bourgeois State, which has become the greatest oppressor after having made people believe it would set them free.
 </p>
<p>
  As explained above, it is very important to link this current development to the history of French imperialism. It is therefore necessary to recognize to this extent to Mayotte an open and deliberate violation of the principle inscribed in the “Principles of the Republic”: “The Republic is one and indivisible”.
 </p>
<p>
  Indivisible, really? However, the questioning the right of nationality over a part of the territory (Mayotte) completely breaks this principle.
 </p>
<p>
  The reactionarization of the bourgeois State of which we are talking about is not an abstraction, it is achieved in concrete measures, where the principles of the bourgeois republic (democratic-liberal) are called into question by the government at its very head. It is not surprising that the forces flirting most openly with fascism support the extension of such measures and claim “ideological victories” when they are introduced.
 </p>
<p>
  It is a necessity for the bourgeoisie to move forward with such weapons even if it means disowning its thinkers and the original writers of its major laws, such as the Constitution of the 5th Republic. It absolutely must restructure the State to ward off the crisis and keep the revolts in check, these are tasks that all go together. Nothing progressive can come from the bourgeoisie. Imperialism is parasitic and French imperialism is a luxurious, hungry parasite, which cannot support its weight without sucking the blood of the proletarians in France and the oppressed peoples abroad. It tries to train us in its fall of its laws, its wars and its delusional projects, and the opportunists of the Parliament try to make us believe that it is possible to save it, not to make reactionary reforms but a “left” program.
 </p>
<p>
  But it is a hard time, the reactionarization of the French bourgeois State has continued frantically in recent years. The only class capable of changing the situation is the proletariat, for it bears the task of bringing down the bourgeois state and, with it, reaction all across the line.

We have seen the development of the decomposition of French imperialism, which is reflected in the form of a crisis at all levels: economic, social, cultural and above all political. This is what we know - all that we feel in our flesh every day that passes, even if sometimes we have trouble named the thing and to take it. The regime crisis looming in perspective - Tive is clear for those who want to see it at the beginning of 2024. First, the reactionary government pushed the establishment of the "Immigra" law - tion ”, which headlines the rights of immigrant proletarians; The end of the soil law in Mayotte which was announced recently goes in the same direction. Macron, Darmanin and others have only one objective at the bottom: this - Him to always atomize the class which pro - lasts everything but which has nothing, that is to say to divide it into Small independent plots of each other on the basis of criteria such as origin, sex, religion, etc., by operating economically always more a fringe of the proletariat in passing. This ATO policy - Class Postation is not new, it was triggered by the bourgeoisie ago - holding a long time, facing an indivisible class or a verrier, having built unique organia and,, So powerful. Since then, thanks to the harmful role of opportunities in the workers' movement who sold the fight for places in warm and pre -featured conciliation and negotiation with fierce struggle, atomization policy has made ravages. The union unit in a single conferred workers' deration is only a distant mirage, and within our proletarian thirds, we can no longer even count the number of "associations", All divided and firing in the legs to find out which one will be able to benefit from more subsidies from the town hall. All this is not inevitable, and our everyday work must go in the direction of the plain - Té on the basis of concrete claims. The absence of a political unity in a real revolutionary party allowing to direct the movement, the only thing that basically serves our emancipation, is the heart of all the pro -, this is where the rest follows. It is because we are not able to make the blows collectively and to bring concrete claims with number and force that the bourgeoisie was able to calmly make her way and little by little to undo the organic ties that we had woven between us , at the expensive price. The recent revolt of farmers has shown another facet of the same problem, the question of management. Without an organization - sation closely connecting small and medium farmers to the rest of the popular masses, and allowing them a politician and organizationally unified action, these legitimate revolts can only be recovered - rees by scales in the pay Large imperialist monopolies, which use it as an adjustment measure. This event has always shown more the gap that can exist - ter between the living conditions of these small operators and their bour - Geoises employer.

This clearly enters the more general plans From the French imperialist bourgeoisie of restructuring of the state and militarization apparatus exacerous, with an increasingly strong tendency to war, as a means of bypassing the substantive problem. All this is very impressive, and we must not underestimate the power of a state in deep crisis; But we are - let us see that this cannot be enough to defeat ourselves definitively, because our class has been able to resist in the worst conditions, in the worst prisons, we are therefore pis of optimism! What to propagate everywhere is therefore the opposite of what the reactionaries say. The role of revolutionary miles is today to bring the class unity, understanding that the increased reactionnarization of the bourgeois state is only one attempt more to block the road. We have only one way to follow, that of the Col - Lective struggle to make our principles triumph over those of the Dec - Dente bourgeoisie. Each leaflet, each debate, each poster, each event; Each action that we take is oh so important - aunt in the current situation, because every day that passes without revolution, it is a day more where we live under an infamous system. We have to fight wherever we act - sounds to make unity triumph against division! The editorial committees of the cause of the people and new era <br/><br/> 4 | The cause of the people n ° 76 National news Authorities Nationalalities of the farmers: the struggle persists, led by the most combative then, was enough of an interview with the leaders of the FNSEA and some lightening on pesticides to calm the anger of the farmers ? You have to face the facts not! Because the bloi - cages continued until March, with new targets and new methods, more local, more dispersed, but still there. Of course, it was completely predictable, when we see how much the situation is in crisis and the government and its Me Sures have not changed anything. But we can emphasize two things: 1) that the national union departments, no - all the leaders of the FNSEA who are big bourgeois, tried to suffocate the case and that, and it is the main one, the Agri - Culuers refused to stop the movement (in connection with departmental organizations). 2) that farmers are starting to target banks, as in Occitania, that is to say directly tackling the financial capital which makes them slaves of large cooperatives, large banking groups and the Euro-Péen (and World) market . These two points are very important because they show that combativeness cannot be matted when the situation is so bad for so many farmers. They also show that the most combative part of the farmers is obviously not that of the big bourgeois, or even of the best -based bourgeois owners, but many the poorest operators, indebted, for whom the burning problems are the loans , prices and income of their work, not pesticides. We therefore see what is happening when the class contradiction within farmers itself. While the work Agri - Cole requires a lot of work and preception on the farm, including during the coldest months, the mobilization without interruption for such a long time of such a number of farmers means that farmers The most mobilized accept the cost of such MO - bilisations for their farm. The victory of the poor part of the "laborer class" cannot be won without the victory of the laborious class. The number, power and strength of the proletariat and the working class in our current society show that this class is the only one capable of leading to the revolution. It is clear, in re - keeping their mobilization, that the farmers who do not exploit anyone, who are struggling to pay a salary and who pour out the hay of the banks today have everything to win in the socialist revolution, the Only who will be able to guarantee a dignified and viable agriculture which serves the interests of the people and not of the world market. The most combative part of the farmers is obviously not that of the big bourgeois, or even the owners of the best lotis bourgeois, but the poorest operators, indebted <br/><br/> Localzoom local zoom 5 | The cause of the people n ° 76victory of the strikers of Emmaus Nord after a long -term struggle after the workers of Vertbau - Det, the CGT of the North tears a new victory with the Regularri - Sation of the 51 Sans -Piers strikers - Emmaüs. The outcome of this long fight is today a victory for the French proletariat which once again shows its abnee - gation and its fighting spirit in front of the exploiters. Nothing would not have been possible without the months of strikes repeated unanimously every night, and without daily class solidarity on the stake and in actions. Because the will - visits were not only exploited by Emmaüs and a rotten, corrupt and racist direction: they were also by the entire administrative and bureaucratic system of French imperialism which not only allows this exploitation, but also And on - everything encourages it! Because that's what it is about, a workforce paid a misery and choreable to thank you which benefits the bosses and the bourgeois class. The regularization of Emmaus undocumented migrants does not come alone. It also takes place in the context of the IM arrival of the Olympic Games, a bourgeois celebration which, with the various sites whose deadline is coming to an end, Em - bends many undocumented workers. The bourgeoisie is terrified at the idea of a revolt or a new strike like the OC - Cupation last October of the Arena project by or - undocumented vriers. In total, there are therefore 620 regularizations won by the CGT, including 502 undocumented workers Franci - Links on strike since October 17, essential to the smooth running of their small festivities. The victory of the companions of Emmaüs of the North is all the more remarkable since the latter had to endure all along their heroic strike the lowest strokes: cutting of heating, threats of closing of the site, fascist mobilization in support of the Direction, racist provocations with the deposit of a wild boar head on the stake, insults ... These unsuccessful tries of destabilization were not enough to begin the determination of the strikers, thanks to the support of the North CGT UD and the Undups Committee 59 (CSP59). The CGT was not spared from the low blows and the repression orchestrated by the bourgeois state, since on October 20, the secretary general of the Northern UD, Jean-Paul, was arrested violently at his Home at 6 a.m. for "apology for terrorism". In question, a press release of October 10 its - reading the resistance of the Palestinian people in the face of the genocidal Zionist occupier, following the global offensive of October 7. Having been quickly released since a court decision has been expected at the end of a judgment at the Lille court on March 28. The CGT already calls for a massive rally on this date and mobilizes all its supports to block the repression in solidarity with Jean-Paul. Like the victorious outcome of the strike of undocumented workers, we can only have confidence in the solidarity of our class to paralyze bourgeois justice and dissuade it from putting our comrade under locks.

In the general context of the immigration law, where soil law was already called into question before the censorship of the Constitutional Council (for technical and non -political reasons), it is necessary to look at this decision to draw consequences on the reaction of the bourgeois state (see our previous issue). The law of the soil, a principle that has become important for the French bourgeoisie vis -à -vis nationality, the French bourgeoisie has evolved over time, following the development of French capitalism. The great French revolution of 1789 in - Talle la bourgeoisie in command. With the first constitutional monarchy (1791), there is a form of soil law which is confirmed - me after the end of the revolution in the Napoleon code of 1804. But this right of the soil is conditional, we cannot say that It is by - ticularly a principle established for the French geoisie, it is also little used. It was in 1851 then in 1889 that the law fixed the law of the soil strongly in French law. Why this ? This is the time when French capitalism needs labor And cannot rest only on the ancient Pays - without, who do not arrive quickly enough in town or died in successive wars. It is therefore necessary to immigrants that we will seek in Italy, Spain, Belgium ... Thus we note for example that 1889, when the new law arrives, it was almost 20 years after 1870-71, time of the Franco- Prussian and Com - Mune; There will therefore necessarily be absent in the age groups which must perform military service, because their potential parents died in war. The law of that year will reflect this reality to force the young people in - children of foreigners to do military service by their majority. So, in the turning point towards imperialism which happens around the end of the 19th century and Beginning of the 20th century, France became the first country of immigration in Europe while restricting nationality in its new colonies where one does not become French as in mainland France (Indigenous Code of 1881). This will continue with the infamous example of the name of "Muslim French" in Algeria, which accompanies so many massacres and persecution. You have to keep this in mind to always remember how French imperia is used to treating those he designates foreign on "his" soil. We can thus say that from the beginning of its contemporary sound (because it also existed in another way under the old regime), the law of the soil evolved in France (and elsewhere in the colonies) according to the necessities of the capitalism then of French imperialism. He opened when there was a workforce, and then closed. But it has become a general principle of the law of the French bourgeoisie, an instrument by which it could control its population in all the bourgeois regimes which have succeeded since the 1st Republic. Consequently, it is quite important to note that its questioning in Mayotte, then in France in general (which is the position of the republicans of Ciotti and is the His - toric position of the RN from Father Le Pen) grows almost no one. On the contrary, this "solution" is sold to masses as a solution to Mayotte problems. It is a sign of the reactionnarization of the State, because the long -standing legal tradition of the bourgeois Mocracy in France is called into question for the first time in an intense manner since the so -called "decolonization" and of - Then the Vichy regime, which had returned to the naturalizations obtained "by the soil" with its fascist government of deportations. Beyond soil law, the negation of French bourgeois democratic principles demonstrations before the French Embassy in the Comoros in 2018. The bourgeoisie absolutely seeks to restructure the State to ward off the crisis and put the revolts <br/><br/> 7 | The cause of the people n ° 76 The French bourgeoisie has always boasted of being the heiress of the Enlightenment, the great ideas, the traditions of freedom and human rights. All this blabla took a big stroke of old when we see the fierce exploitation and the inhuman measures taken through the last 175 years by the bourgeois state of - who came the greatest oppressor after making people believe that he would make citizens free. As explained above, it is very important to link this current development to the history of French imperialism. It is therefore necessary to recognize to this extent to Mayotte a violation or - green and deliberate of the principle, however inscribed in the "Principles of the Republic": "The Republic is one and indivisible". Indivisible, really? However, the questioning of the right of nationality on a part only of the territory (Mayotte) total breaks this principle. The reactionnarization of the bourgeois state of which we are talking about is not an abstraction, it is carried out in concrete measures, where the principles of the bourgeois republic (demo -cratic -liberal) are called into question by the government which is Even head of this one. It is not surprising that the forces flirting most openly with fascism support the extension of such measures and demand "ideological victories" when they are presented. It is a necessity for the bourgeoisie to move forward with such weapons even if it means dedicating its thinkers and the original writers of its major laws, such as the Constitution of the 5th Republic. He absolutely needs to resort the state to ward off the crisis and put the revolts in step, these are tasks that go all together. Nothing progressive can come from the bourgeoisie. Imperialism is a parasitic and French imperialism is a luxurious, hungry parasite, which cannot support its weight without sucking the blood of the proletarians in France and the peoples oppressed to The stranger. He tries to train us in his fall by his laws, his wars and his delusional projects, and the Portunists of the Parliament try to make us believe that it is possible to save him, not to make reactionary reforms but a pro - Gram "on the left". But it is a lost pain, the reaction of the French bourgeois state continues frenzied in recent years. The only class capable of changing the situation is the proleti - riat, because it carries the task of slaughtering the Bour - Geois state and with it, the reaction on the whole line. Wuambushu 2: increased militarization in Mayotte Under the pretext of security already last year we talked about Wuambushu, the Macron government operation in Mayotte which had led to the destruction of several districts, making a large number of homeless people in the population of the island. In April the French state launched the Wuambushu 2 operation, with reactionary controls to prevent any resistance and carry out the decasses (destruction of dwellings). The problem of delinquency, on which the bourgeois state strongly emphasizes, is in reality the problem of resistance to forces of repression: the mid -overseas has announced the ban on machete sales and the Possibility of euthanizing the "attack dogs" in anticipation of the entrance of the police and gendarmes in the slums. But who created the "bands" and the "heads of bands" that the French state complains of having to "pacify"? Is it not an attitude of a pyromaniac firefighter to illegally occupy a territory, to attack with bulldozers and police officers and gendarmes the poor districts where a very young population is mass, without perspective and often without paper, and Then surprise the emerging problems? In reality there is nothing surprising in there, neither for the bourgeois state nor for us. This is part of their disgusting maneuvers to divide the people, present themselves as the "Saviors" of the "good people" of Mayotte, who has his papers, who has hard houses. All this against the "thugs" and the "criminals" that French imperialism itself created by its policy, not only in Mayotte, but also towards the Comoros, the archipelago of which the island is part and which is among The poorest in the world. The decor is placed, the bourgeois state wants us to believe that there are the gentiles on one side and on the other the bad guys and that he has nothing to do with the case, all that while He has the crime weapon in his hands. Wuambushu 2 is not an operation of "pacification", it is a militarization of the territory of Mayotte, a territory where you can be destroyed your house at any time, euthanize your dog without reason, or not to have clean water for weeks. Gendarmes during clashes with young people on April 25, 2023. <br/><br/>  8 | The cause of the people n ° 76 National news Aurore Aurore Bergé threatens to suppress subsidies to associations The idea was posed on the table by the Minister in response to the site - tion in Palestine. Indeed, several associations dedicated to women denounced the situation in Gaza where the headquarters have already led to the death of tens of thousands of people, so many women too. Madame Au - Rore Bergé therefore considers that denouncing what is happening in Gaza is "having ambiguous remarks" and she uses her government power to threaten to remove bread from the mouth to the associations! Here we see a fine example of Macron's attempt to corporify the French imperialist state, that is to say that the state is held in a direct relationship with the masses, without inter-media, or that these intermediaries are His own institutions, under his own control. Another recent example is that of the Human Rights League, attacked by Darmanin after the mobilization of Sainte-Soline a year ago. Indeed, there are more than 1.3 million associations in France, many of which take advantage of state subvenations. These various associations (spor -off, cultural, political, social, etc.) also regularly serve the State as "relays" in society, by ensuring missions for which the famous "public service" has been put aside. Let us simply take the example of violence against women, supposedly "great cause of the five-year term" and therefore of Aurore Bergé: the telephone number praised by the government to alert on this subject, the 3919, is very largely managed by Associa - tions. So, if the bourgeois state finances them - tions and they are useful to him for a certain ni - calf, why then the ministers of the government - do they publicly threaten to cut the tap of subsidies? What to do against that? Well, you have to understand that the mid - associative place developed from the years born 1970-1980, that is to say in the period when the bourgeois state begins to restructure-RER against the crisis of mass unemployment. Local or national, political and social associations have been created and organized masses movements on different scales on various subjects. Today, the bourgeois state wants to save money and above all wants to control absolutely the political content of these associations which are important for social life. It is out of the question to have anything from Oppo - sa to the government and the interests of the state! Associations must stick to "neutrality" or the government line, if not, no subsidy! In this way, the masses are directly submitted, taken there in associative life, to the politics of the bourgeois state. The interests of associations must become those of the bourgeoisie if they want to continue to receive money, the class struggle must be erased and the direct social bond between the bourgeois state and the proletarian: it is corporatism that we have spoken above. We see to a certain extent the same phenomenon in the bourgeois media: those who do not depend on a billionaire live on state subsidies, and Macron recalled during his interview with humanity that the State "helped" thus newspapers. It is therefore an important alarm signal, whether one is a member of an association, a Syn - Dicat, or any other organization. In 2024, it was completely foolish to build a gold - Ganisation based on the "support" FI - Nancier of the bourgeois state. It is only a turnover that is given before using the stick! On the contrary, it is necessary to rely on the only ones which are capable of supporting the struggle to the end and of supporting it, including financially, because it is theirs: the popular masses in general, and the proletariat in particular. <br/><br/> International International9 | The cause of the people n ° 76 on February 12, of the fitted and Belgian flags burn before the UN embassies and offices, in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Pro demonstrators - have been testing against the conflict that has ravaged their country for 25 years, which has already killed more than 6 million people, under the eyes of the plunderers, indifferent to yet another genocide. In the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the conflict, passed over in silence by the major press groups of our imperialist countries, has been going on since 1996 and has been 6 milth and millions of displaced . A multitude of armed groups and lackery gimes in the region, working for different imperialists, are involved. From - then 2 years, it is mainly the M23 and the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo who compete. The M23, supported by Rwanda, bases its claims on discrimination against the Congolese Tutsis, who fled the genocide of which they were victims in Rwanda in 1994, and other ethnic communities in northern and southern Kivu, CISSES - derects of Rwandan origin. Since the 1994 genocide, the control of minerals and CIRs - cooked exit has been for Rwanda a way of continuing war in another form. The stakes are high: create an eco -nomic base to compensate for your geographic situation - landlocked phique and its modest natural resources. “Westerners are behind the looting of our country. Rwanda does not work alone, so they have to leave our country, "said a protester in Reuters. The crowd threw stones on the American embassy, burned flags, and destroys foreign stores, like that of the French channel Canal+. Several vehicles of the so -called "peacekeeping" mission of the UN have been in - cendied and looted in the east of the DRC. Police repressed the demonstrators by pulling tear gas and keeping several Ambas - Sades, including the French and United States Embassies. They also have their nationals of "low profile" and not to leave their homes, and many international schools and imperialists have been closed. Already in March 2023, during his strategic trip to Central Africa to try to preserve the threatened interests of French imperialism, Macron had been welcomed by manifestos: "We burned the flag of France (...) to express Our indignation with regard to the financial support that France brings to Rwanda to finance the rebels of the M23 which attack us. The DRC is of great interest in many imperialists because of its natural sources: it has 80 % of the world of Coltan, in the basements of North Kivu and South Kivu. Recognized for its hard - tee and extreme resistance to Heat and corrosion, this metal is used in aerospace, armament and electronics. In addition, the Congolese pass has high dioactivity; Its concentration could provide fissile materials likely to replace uranium in certain applications. Currently, China controls most Congo mines and provides the Congolese state with drones and weapons to combat the M23 group. In addition, the ar - Mées de la DRC forces are directly supported by the so -called "peacekeeping" mission of the United Nations, which however withdrew after having faced the opposition of the Congo - Lais and to the failure of "stabilization" of the country. The DRC "security" forces have gone many atrocities against the population, such as extrajudicial executions and repression against those who criticized the UN operation in the country. The M23 has increased significantly in recent months and is found at the gates of Goma, the capital of North Kivu1. Goma is the only city in the region to have an important Internatio - NAL airport and substantial infrastructure. The concern of the imperialists with regard to the M23 has nothing to do with anxiety for the Congolese people. The only thing that worries them, in reality, is the loss of access to mining resources, as manifests have denounced. 1. In 2012, for 10 days, the M23 had already occupied the city of Goma. Its rapid ascent and its links with Rwanda had aroused concern and launched international efforts for a cease-fire. After talks, the M23 had ended its rebel in 2013, but has since resumed arms.

The demonstrations have blocked most of trafficking and economic activity in many regions. Several at the country's torouts were completely blocked. The first mansions left 4 dead and more than 30 injured. The supporters of Imran Khan and other parties denounced a manipulation in the reorganization of votes, which also took several days. From the start, these elections have been an absolute farce led by the Giant Pakistani classes and imperialism. Imran Khan (the former president, ousted in 2022, support for the interests of Chinese social-imperialism) was maintained outside the duel with the aid of questionable criminal charges. But the PTI (Pakistan Movement for Justice), Imran Khan's party, has largely came at the top of the ballot, winning 93 seats. However, they were not allowed to form a new government, because it is only allowed to parties - the majority of them were forced to present themselves under the "independent" label. It is therefore a government alliance without the PTI which was announced, with the PLM -N (Party of the Muslim League) and the Pakistani people party, led by two families historically in power in Pakistan since the decades. The main objective of these elections, which was from the country by making the country by allowing the formation of a new government for the State, is fulfilled only on the facade. The deep crisis in Pakistan is not resolved by the appointment as a Prime Minister of a new puppet in the pay of Yankee imperialism. 40 % of the population still lives below the poverty line, and the PA - Kistani masses are not fooled. To the point that even many bourgeois media highlighted the lack of total transparency and the way everything has been put in place so that the PLM-N won the elections with the help of the army. 2) Tesla, located in Germany, has been sabotage on the part of activists calling on the "Vulkan Gruppe".

A speech was read: "These streets which are closed to us are open to sects that propagate hatred (…). What they call "family" is a structure that is imposed on us, in which we are subject to abuses and violence, where our work, our body and our existence are ignored and exploited. We are supposed to accept inequalities in order to have accommodation and reach both ends. Living differently is “shameful” and “prohibited”.

Tower 22 is one of their military bases, it located at the northeast corner of Jordan, on the border with Iraq and Syria, and serves as a fundamental home for the operations of Yankee imperialism In the region, especially in Syria. The base has around 350 soldiers, and Jordan, a historic key ally of the USA, has around 4,000, including hundreds of trainers, and organizes intensive exercises throughout the year. The facts were claimed by Islamic resistance in Iraq, an informal coalition of armed groups supported by Iran, which opposes the aid that the United States brought to Israel in the massacre in Gaza, and more generally to Yankee imperialism in the Middle East. Iran officially deny any involvement. Since the withdrawal of Afghanistan in 2021, American troops had gone from 160 000 to 30,000 soldiers in the Middle East. But since the last 7 OCBre, the United States has sent thousands of supremely pleasant soldiers to the region, especially on warships. In retaliation, they have been attacked more than 160 times by militias supported by Iran, injuring about 80 soldiers. <br/><br/> Theoretheomie 12 | The cause of the people n ° 76th text serves as a short introductory - tion to allow us to understand the process of the global pro -Latarian revolution. Why are we talking about Revolution my - diaine? First of all because the proletariat is an international class, which shares its interests worldwide. Then, because the purpose of the revolution, communism, cannot be reached as long as the class society exists in the world, either we are all entering it, or no one enters it. Consequently, the Ré - Envolution is global. Despite this, this revolution is carried out in countries according to their national framework, and it therefore develops unevenly, not in unison. Thus, in the 20th century, the Russian Revolution of 1917 allowed a great progress to the revolution in the world, but all dominoes did not fall at the same time elsewhere in Europe, and the USSR has become a base of support to The proletarian revolution my diaial in other countries. Thus, the world proletarian revolution is a unity, when the revolution arrives in a country, it has an impact in all the others. In 2024, more than 100 years after 1917, some believe that the world revolution is dead and buried, that it is an ancient history of the 20th century, and that it is necessary today to be in new questions. They think communism has failed. However, the class struggle is strengthened in the world and the contradictions are reached! The main contradiction at the time of imperialism, wars and revolutions, is as follows: on the one hand there are oppressive countries (imperialists) and on the other of the oppressed countries. It is within this framework that the funded contradiction of capitalism develops, that between social production and private property, between work and capital and all other contradictions. Thus the Communist Party of China indicated in the important "Chinese letter" of 1963: "Some even deny the great scope of the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America against imperialism And, under the pretext of bringing down the barriers of nationality, skin color and geo -graphic location, they try by all means to erase the line of demarcation between oppressed nations and oppressive nations, between oppressed countries and oppressive countries, to stifle the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of these re -gions [...] This "theory" does not really aim to bring down the barriers of nationality, the color of the skin and the geo location - graphic, but to maintain the domination of "higher nations" over the oppi - mes nations. [...] The working class [...] must study the revolutionary experience of the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America, firmly support their revolutionary action, and consider the cause of their release as support The surest for herself, like her direct interest. Only this way of acting makes it possible to bring down the barriers of nationality, color and geographic location, theory: How to understand the world proletarian revolution?

Without the Union with the oppressed nations, without the release of these, the working class of the capitalist countries of Europe and America will never have its release. Lenin has very well said: “The revolutionary movement of the advanced countries would in fact be only a simple - perie without the complete and the closest in the struggle of workers in Europe and America against capital and hundreds and hundreds of millions of slaves 'colo - niaux' oppressed by this capital. ” (V.I. Lenin, The 2nd Congress of the Communist International, Works, Tome 31) "Some, who believe they respect Marx and his work, claim that he thought that the Revolution could only take place in Europe, where the capitalism was the most developed. Of course, Marx and Engels1 paid great attention to England, then later to the Alle - Magne, because they were the countries where the development of capitalism and the working class allowed the most complete during the Revolution. However, in several letters in Vera Zassoulitch, a Russian activist, Marx explains how the democratic and agrarian revolution in Russia could launch a process - the "regenerator of Russian society", higher - 1. Founders of Marxism, German revolutionaries having lived in through Europe in the 19th century. Head of capitalism. And it is on this basis that Lenin2 develops - by his thesis of the role of the revolution in the oppressed nations, of the combination between the international communist movement and the national liberation movement against imperialism. In the too often forgotten Address to the second Russian congress of communist organizations of the peoples of the East, Lenin says: "This is why I think that in the history of the development of the World Revolution - which, to judge by its beginning , will continue for many years and will require a lot of effort - in the revolutionary struggle, in the Revo -Lationalion Movement, you [the East peoples] will be called to play a big role and to merge with our fight against the Imperialism internal - tional. Your participation in the inter - - national revolution will confront you with a complete and difficult task, the accomplishment of which will serve as the basis for our common success, because here the majority of the people begins for the first time to act independently and will be an active factor in the fight to return - to serve international imperialism. Thus, the oppressed nations, which represent the majority of humanity and are found in Asia, in Africa, in Latin America and even 2. large Russian revolutionary having led the revolution of 1917. In Eastern Europe, are the centers of the global proletarian revolution. They constitute - kill the Third World, which is a point ES - Sential of the theory of President Mao3: "Three worlds that are delimited". The mention of third world is not negative or insulting, on the contrary, it underlines the central role of these countries in the Revolution. It should not be confused with the revisionist theory which will be carried by Deng Xiaoping4 and which amounts to advocating the alliance with an imperia power - more "weak" list against a stronger power or a superpower. The period of "strategic offensive" on the contrary is a synthesis on the world revolution. It means that the struggles of the oppressed nations against imperialism are those which today have the weight and the potential for the overthrow of imperialism. All the more at our period which is that of the strategic offensive, where the proletariat and the peoples of the whole world must be taken to attack the decomposition imperialism which lives a general crisis everywhere and spares no country . President Gonzalo5 says in this regard: "It is a strategy, it is a global grip of the place where the weight of the masses on earth is, it is the problem of relations between imperialism and the Na - oppressed tions, that's the problem. This is a problem that can only be understood in the current international situation, starting from the international economic relations of imperialism, it is Lenin's thesis. It is ridiculous to conclude that the struggle in imperialist countries is removed by this strategic analysis, that the revolution here is possible. By clarifying this, we must understand the necessary socialist revolution in France as a part of the proletable revolution - no worldwide which is a whole. This part will be at the service of the whole process, and each advancement in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere will serve us because it will undermine the basis of French imperialism and therefore, from our main enemy just as, in return, Our process will serve peoples around the world. The current warlike aggressiveness of Im - Perianism, which will defend its monstrous system to death, must be seen as a sign of weakness, and not a force. A wild beast is always more snarling on the verge of death than when it is triumphant. 3. great Chinese revolutionary who led the Communist Party of China. 4. Director of the right line in China, having taken power in a coup after 1976 to embark China on the path of capitalism. 5. Grand Peruvian revolutionary who led the Communist Party of Peru. <br/><br/>  International International14 | The cause of the people n ° 76 we publish here an unofficial translation of an article in the Anglophone Mé- Dia Dia Red Herald, published on February 14, updated in mid-March by the writing of the cause of the people. In Senegal, clashes between demonstrators and "security forces" broke out on February 4 after parliament decided to postpone the pre -presidential election, confirming the unilateral announcement of the current President Macky Salle, just before the start of the electoral campaign. According to the media, at least three mansions were murdered by the "security forces". The youngest of them, 16, was shot in the head. The Senegalese state also has a neck - Pé the Internet to impose a stricter cen - sure. Senegal is considered to be a "stable" country, which has a "long tradition of dice and respect for human rights" by the imperialists. However, even before the postponement of the elections, Macky Sall's rivals were the subject of criminal accusations and imprisonment. His main rival, Ousmane Sonko, was accused of rape, among other things, an allegation that would have been politically motivated by his supporters. Struggles, during which at least 13 people were shot by the riot police, took place against his imprisonment in 2021. Sonko was detained for several months for "corruption of minors and incentive to the insurrection" , although he was acquitted of the accusation of rape. Many journalists and activists have been arrested for denouncing the restrictions imposed on Sonko and SES by - TI. Finally, Sonko was released on March 14. Of course, he is only a representative of another section of the ruling classes, and there is no doubt that he would work just as im - pitifully if he was in power to serve the interests of his country. After the serious political crisis of recent months, the Constitutional Council of Senegal forced Macky Sall to set a new date of presidential election before the end of his mandate on April 2. The date was arrested on March 24. The right to vote and the "free elections" are considered as fundamental ideals of bourgeois democracy, and the attempt to postpone elections by a unilateed announcement - rale of the president, which according to the Sé -Negalaise Constitution is not authorized to Continuing after being in power since 2012 was a clear violation of these ideals. Despite this, the postponement of the elections was part of the institutional framework of the Senegalese state, as pointed out by a political scientist based in the United States. Mr. Sall simply signed a decree of announcing a measure dating from November 2023 which defined the date of the elections. He invoked - which problems related to the list of candidates, some of his rivals had already been excluded, and called for the holding of a corporatist "Dia - National Logue" to "create the conditions of a Free, transparent and inclusive election in a peaceful and reconci - linked Senegal ”. This illustrates the rot of bureaucratic capitalism and the illusory nature of democratic and liberal rights. The imperialists have worried about the struggle in Senegal, a relatively stable country of the Ré -Gion du Sahel, where multiple military couples have taken place in recent years. A series of cynical statements have been able to - bliated. For example, the UN, an imperialist instrument dominated by the United States, condemned violations of "human rights" com - put by riot police and called on the government to make the "national dialogue "Inclusive". French imperialism has asked the police to use violence "proportion - born" against the demonstrators and hoped that the elections would be held soon. The Imperia - American Lism has also declared itself "pro -concerned" by the situation. What is expressed in the demonstrations is the request of the Senegalese people for democratic rights and for a change in their conditions, a large number of my - nifestants being angry young people with the life of suffering that Capita - Bureaucratic Lism. At the same time, certain forces try to limit the struggle to an electoral fight or to appease it by organizing peaceful protest marches, in order to preserve this order of oppression at the price of the blood of the people. Elections by the president demonstrating in front of a fire barricade in Dakar on February 4, 2024. <br/><br/>  15 | The cause of the people n ° 76 The paths of power the paths of PowerPalestine: how the resistance faces the genocidal offensive The war opened 75 years ago in Palestine. The Zionist State of Israel was founded at the cost of destroying the villages and the exodus of 800,000 Palestinians. Rediscovered today in "pockets", in the West Bank, in Gaza, or in neighboring states, the PA - Lestinians have nothing to lose. Since the counter-offensive of October 7, Israel has launched a major genocidal operation, claiming to definitively settle the "Palestinian problem" in Gaza. Since then, the world can hardly look elsewhere. In just four months, The Israeli operation has killed both and two years of Ukraine invasion by Russia. The intensity of imperialist propaganda is as important as the military effort deployed on the spot. Everywhere, the reactionary press talks about the "right of Israel to defend oneself", victims who are not "of the same nature" depending on whether it is the Israelis victims of the Offen - Sive of October 7, or else If we talk about the POLAlation of Gaza victim of bombings and the earthly invasion. International law is clear, however: the UN recognizes the West Bank - Nie, Jerusalem -Est and the Gaza Strip as territories illegally occupied by the Zionist Arpone. He recognizes that there is no right "to defend himself" against an enemy who is not a state and, moreover, comes from an illegally occupied territory. The principles of international law recognize this - that the resistance, including an army, to an occupation is a legitimate right: the right that the Palestinian resistance proudly affirmed on October 7. Georges Abdallah: 40 in prison for his fight for Palestine this year marks, in France, the 40th anniversary of the anti -impelly fighter - Lebanese rialist and anti -Zionist Georges Ibra - Him Abdallah, accused of complicity in Assassi - Nat de Two American and Israeli diplomats in Paris in 1982. In his last statement, he reminds us: "These people have defeated all the colonialist settlement policy implemented for more than a century by the ex -Zionist depression of the imperialist West. The ethnic cleaning of the land of Palestine and its indomitable inhabitants is more than a failure. More than half of the Palestinian people now live in historical Palestine. The Zionist Mou - Vement has never succeeded and never succeeded in breaking the unshakable will of women and men, young and old Palestinians to lead the struggle on all fronts to release Palestine, all Palestine . [...] Resistance remains unshakable, protected and adopted by the Population - Laires masses. Gaza will never wear the white flag of the capitulation ... Neither the Zionists nor any criminal force will never succeed in breaking the will of resistance to Gaza. We never forget that these are the bowels of these refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon, that the Expres - the Palestinian Historian Fighting: The Fedayin. More than ever, this resistance to genocidal aggression is green and carries the promise of the Fedayin ... "Israel is digging its own tomb today, Gaza is on the verge of famine. The majority of the Israeli civilian population, one of the most militarized in the world, supports the genocidal war. The few refractories for enrollment in the Zionist army are seen in prison. A few weeks ago, the Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti1 was placed in isolation by the Zionist occupier, AC - cited to prepare an intifada2 in the West Bank. He was beaten by his jailers on March 6 and 12. The state of Israel is aggressive because it knows is weak. In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian ghost plays tend successful Emcades in the face of the invasion. The Israeli army is pleased to have "neutralized 15,000 terrorists" because the Palestinian mass is confused with active resistance. The Palestinian fees today are the children of the 20143 July -August massacre. No matter the magnitude of the massacres that take place today, Israel is digging here, in this sea of blood, its own tomb. Palestine will win ! 1. Marwan Barghouti is Palestinian leader, member of the legislative and dissident of Fatah, imprisoned by Israel since 2002. 2. An intifada designates the general uprising of the Palestinian population throughout Palestine, including Jerusalem and the Territories Revened by Israel. The first (1987-1993) led to the capitulation of the PLO and the future training of the Palestinian Authority; The second (2000-2005) led to the end of colonization and at the start of the blockade to the Gaza Strip, as well as the construction of the Israeli separation wall, fragmenting the West Bank to accelerate the colonization of the territory. 3. Israeli air strikes on Gaza had already killed 1,400 people. The Palestinian fighters today are the children of the 2014 massacre of Palestinian fighters from the Al-Qassam brigades, in the Gaza Strip on July 19, 2023. <br/><br/> Our movement our movement16 | The cause of the people n ° 76 Paris: Tribute to the heroes of the proletariat on Sunday, February 25, the cause of the people called to commemorate the heroes of the French proletariat. Like every year, this commemorative event was aimed at honoring Pierre Overney, worker Revolution - Naire, seller of the cause of the people. On February 25, 1972, when Pierrot had the hard experience of forced unemployment, fired from Renault for political reasons, he participated in a leaflet distributions in front of the factory to commemorate the 10 years of the massacre of the Charonne metro, a Demonstration which followed the massacre of October 17, 1961 where the French police drowned the Algerians en masse. Following his death, class solidarity is immense, and more than 200,000 people walk in a long procession behind his coffin in early March 1972. We also paid a special tribute to the heroes of the Manouchian group (FTP-Moi), giving Their life for the Communist Party and the Revolution 80 years ago. In addition to a saying, two letters were read to the comrades present. The first is made up of extracts from Missak Manouchian's letter to Mélinée, his wife, before her death. She demonstrates all her internationalism and heroism. The Deu - XIth is a letter from the Bulgarian worker Lu - Tibrodsky, sentenced to death by the dictatorship in 1934, to his father. This letter was broadcast to thousands of copies at the time as an example of the relentless struggle against the Bour - Geoisie and Fascism. The demonstration, by - so much of the Metro Père Lachaise, therefore passed on the tomb of Pierrot, then on that of Szlama Grzywacz, communist fighter, Jew Po - Lonais Member of the Manouchian group, died shot on February 21, 1944. Read the speech read during the manifestation by the cause of the people: <br/><br/> 17 | The cause of the people n ° 76 Our movement our movement17 | The cause of the people n ° 7617 | The cause of the people n ° 76Autriche: commemoration of February 1934 in Austria, our comrades of the ROTE FAHNE newspaper reported that a ma - nifestation was held in Vienna on February 12, to commemorate the 90th anniversary - Tion of February 1934. At the time, the fighting rumbled in Vienne and opposed the workers, communists and socialist forces, to the fascist forces, who rally the so -called "republican" army. Despite the military defeat of the workers' forces - 7000 combat - workers who lose life - these battles were decisive for the development of the resistance against the new Aus - Trofascist regime, then the Nazi "Third Reich". The demonstration took place near Karl -Marx -Hof, which is a set of buildings of workers' housing, and a historic place of the socialist movement of Austria, which underwent the assaults to the cannon of the Fascist army 90 years ago. The banners, the flags and the songs celebrated this struggle with dignity in order to recall its lessons. The unitary slogan "Remembering is to fight" has been chanted, Ain - if slogans against inflation, wage theft, against rearmament and NATO. Palestinian flags have been spotted in the crowd, symbolic expression of international solidari - and against the censorship that the ruling classes want to impose on the Austrian people in solidarity with the Palestinian people. On the banner, we can read: "1934: their blood did not flow in vain ... for the reconstruction of the Communist Party of Austria! »» <br/><br/> Women in fighting in wrestling 18 | The cause of the people n ° 76Tus the years in March 8 is the International Women's Wrestling Day, which aims to celebrate and highlight the just struggle of women proletarian for their emancipation through the socialist revo. The history of the International Women's Wrestling Day begins within the second international, during the second conference of socialist women, which was held in Copen - Hague in August 1910. It is on a proposal from comrade Clara Zetkin1 that is adopted the proposal of principle to organize a day - born to mobilize women "in accordance with political and syn - dicals of the proletariat endowed with class conscience", without having a date For the holding of this day. Created by the socialist movement of the time, this day then aims to formalize an opposition to bourgeois feminism, very influential at the time, and bring together revolutionary women in defense of pro - letareal feminism, of the emancipation of women by the release of the proletariat. It was following this decision that is organized in the year, the first international day of women's wrestling day, on March 19, 1911, with the main claim to obtain the right to vote for all women, as decided at the Conference of Socialist Women. This first demonstration is very wide - ment followed in many European countries where nearly a million people participate in demonstrations. On March 8, date in tribute to a workers' strike in Petrograd in the years that followed, between 1911 And 1915, other similar days are organized in different European countries and in Russia, continuing to bring claims for voting for women. The date of March 8 appears for the first time during this PE - RIOD, in 1914 in Germany, where a day of struggle is organized for obtaining the right to vote by socialist women. It is towards 1. German communist leader, known for his work in the international struggle of socialist women. The end of the First World War that we find this date of March 8, in Russia in 1917, with this time- this new recent - Dications. Petrograd's workers' women get on strike, demanding bread to be able to eat and feed their children, and the return of their relatives to the front in an unjust inter-imperialist war that only brings them misery. This event is a sou - wind considered to be the beginning of the Soviet revolution. In memory of this Histo -Rique day, March 8 is designated as "International Women's Wrestling Day" in the USSR from 1921. March 8 is then gradually won throughout the world as the day - born International women, carrying demands for access to work, equal pay, equitable sharing of work -meter work. It is primarily mainly in the Soviet Union and in socialist countries that this day is growing, then later within the People's Republic of China, before starting to touch the imperialist powers during the 1960s and 1970. The UN did not decreed until 1977 on March 8 as "International Women's Day" by enjoining its member states to celebrate this day. This appellation of "International Women's Day" is known - throws many criticisms, especially because of the claimy vagueness and the erasure correctly asking the question of the emancipation of women, it is to do it as a revolutionaries the March 8, a legacy of the socialist movement of women <br/><br/>  19 | The cause of the 76 -historical people that it highlights. Some gold - Liberal feminist ganisations prefer the term "International Day of Women's Rights", thus trying to highlight the need for equality of women and men in the eyes of the law. International Rights Day ... Bourgeois of women This name of "International Day of Women's Rights", it is not correctly the historical reality of this day. She takes away her character of a day of struggle, strikes of workers within the socialist movement. This name also places access to rights as the purpose of emancipation of women, as if the inevitable ends end from the moment when it is written in the law that women and men must be equal. We can see that this is not the case, that women continue to be those who mainly deal with children and domestic work; that hiring discrimination are still relevant; that women continue to be attacked, raped and killed; In short, that effective equality is still not reached. To arise the question of the emancipation of women properly is to do it as revollers, it is to do it in the context of the profound modification of our pro -duction relationships, to acquire economic and political freedom Women by the death of the old capitalist world and the advent of the new socialist world. We cannot be content to fight for fictitious rights that do not lead to a modification of the company. An inseparable struggle of the struggle for the socialist revolution The struggle for the emancipation of pro - Laters through proletarian feminism, pre - - feels in the demands of March 8 of - then the first years of this day, unfortunately ceded the Make way for these claims - abstract liberal cations centered around bourgeois law. Increasingly the economic claims, the celebration of women struggling for their emancipation all over the world, are relegated to the background, behind vague claims. These cannot become reality in a context of bourgeois domination of society. The fight against gender -based and sexual violence is an example, an essential struggle that we must lead but which cannot Abou - shot under capitalism, a great cause of the MIDRONNATE Macron having brought to any change, no improvement of the situation. Women are still as much victims of violence more than 5 years after taking over presidential office. The struggle for the emancipation of women detached from the class struggle cannot succeed, It is inseparable from the revolutionary social struggle - List for the dictatorship of the proletariat. So let's now celebrate the International Women's Wrestling Day and continue to lead the struggle for the emancipation of women through the Revolution! On March 4, 2024, the Macron government had the freedom to resort to abortion in the French Constitution. The opportunity for one of the most reacters and liberticides of the fifth republic to restore an image undermined by half a decade of unpopular measures and marginalizations of the most fragile populations. After a cessation of great pumps on March 8, the Constitution was well endowed with a new article, a "fundamental step" for the rights of women according to the minister responsible for equality between women and men Aurore Bergé. In great words for ultimately not much, because what has been constitutionalized is not the right to be able to resort to an abortion for everyone who can need it, but the freedom to do so. The distinction is signifi - cative because it does not offer any guarantee for people wishing to use their freedom to abort that they can do it in decent conditions. It is therefore a hollow measure, a handle effect by an unpopular government in need to get a good image, to the detriment in - Core once the struggle for the emancipation of women which is reduced to A storage and a series of postures and declarations without the slightest effect. We deserve better than that and must fight for our own emancipation which can never go through compromise with the bourgeoisie and its defenders! The scam of the constitutionalization of abortion demonstration in Paris, March 8, 2024. The activists carry portraits of large revolutionary women.

<em>
   We publish an unofficial translation of the Weekly Editorial of A Nova Democracia.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The investigations, contrary to the unfortunate speech of Luiz Inácio’s minister, are not completed – at least, not from a scientific and true point of view. There is a lot to delve into if you want to prove the real motivation for the crime.
 </p>
<p>
  It is strange to hear from the current government’s Minister of Justice, Ricardo Lewandowsky, that the Marielle case is closed, without a plausible motivation being presented. That the Brazão family and the former head of the Civil Police, Rivaldo Barbosa, are involved, no one doubts. But it is stupid to think that Marielle was executed, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, in 2018, amid military intervention, for having voted against a bill that was approved for the benefit of the Rio mafias (badly called “militias”). The execution, carried out in a blatant far-right way, sending a clear message to the left and with the aim of destabilizing the political situation, has no identity with the motivation presented for the crime as a conclusion of the Federal Police investigation.
 </p>
<p>
  The Bolsonaro clan’s relations with Élcio de Queiroz and Ronnie Lessa, driver and executor of the shooting on March 14, 2018, are known. On the day of Marielle’s execution, Élcio de Queiroz was at Bolsonaro’s residency in the apartment 58, whose owner is Jair Bolsonaro, and he appears in the guest book. Why did Luiz Inácio’s minister ignore this fact, reported in 2019 by the residency doorman? Ronnie Lessa received a prosthesis from Bolsonaro when he lost his leg in an attack in 2009. Why does Lessa say he doesn’t know Bolsonaro?
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   Perhaps leaving someone else to clean up the mess, Bolsonaro took refuge, for two days, in the Hungarian embassy, a country governed by one of the leaders of the global far right and a friend of the president, when the investigations into the Marielle case quickly moved to prisons. Bolsonaro is afraid of what? Although, it is true, in addition to this reason there is no shortage of others: there are accusations, investigations and proceedings for various crimes committed by him that could lead to him being arrested.
  </p>
<p>
   It is certain that the Bolsonaro clan has some kind of relationship, to some degree, with the murder of Marielle Franco. She was not killed because she voted against a bill, nor would the Brazão be so stupid as to attract all the attention to their criminal business, with a blatant political assassination,
   <em>
    just because
   </em>
   they confronted in a vote, in which not even the councilor’s vote was decisive. The motivation presented by the Federal Police resembles a false trail that pointed to certain “militias”, as the Civil Police did in 2018, when they accused another militia member who was already in prison and serving a 25-year sentence – Orlando Oliveira Araújo “Curicica” – as the person behind the attack on Marielle; at the time, Orlando rejected the accusation, for which there was no evidence.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    The investigations, contrary to the unfortunate speech of Luiz Inácio’s minister, are not completed – at least, not from a scientific and true point of view. There is a lot to delve into if you want to prove the real motivation for the crime. But, judging by the conduct of the minister and Luiz Inácio, irreducibly committed to the policy of appeasement with the soldiers, their purpose is to bury the matter.
   </p>
<p>
    Who ordered the murder of Marielle Franco?

  We have previously
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/14/clashes-in-senegal-after-president-postpones-elections/">
   reported
  </a>
  on clashes in Senegal after the parliament on the 5
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February decided to postpone the presidential elections originally scheduled for the 25
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February. In the clashes the “security forces” murdered three protesters, including a 16-year-old who was shot in the head.
 </p>
<p>
  On the 6
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March the postponement of the election was overruled, and it was decided that the election had to take place before the 2
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of April, the end of the term of the current President of Senegal, Macky Sall. Sall accepted the decision and announced that the election would be held on the 24
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March.
 </p>
<p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cnx753jej07t/senegal">
   election resulted
  </a>
  in favor of Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who received 54.28% of the votes. Sall has already conceded and congratulated Faye.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialist institutions, such as the The Royal Institute of International Affairs of British imperialism, has
  <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/03/democracy-west-africa-why-senegals-election-crisis-matters">
   hailed the election
  </a>
  as a “critical victory” for Senegalese democracy and a “national turning point”, as well as important for the stability in West Africa. However, only 61% of those registered to vote participated in the election. This is down from the
  <a href="https://conseilconstitutionnel.sn/decision-n-4-e-2019-affaire-n-25-e-19/">
   voter turnout of 66%
  </a>
  in the last presidential election in Senegal in 2019. There were also several candidates who were not allowed to run, including Ousmane Sonko, who got more than 15% present of the votes in the 2019 election, and Karim Wade, who got more than 34% of the votes in the 2012 election.

   Latehar District, March 30, 2024:
  </strong>
  A sub-zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist) was arrested in Jharkhand’s Latehar district, a police official announced to the press today.

 </p>
<p class="_yeti_done">
  Latehar Superintendent of Police Anjani Anjan Stated Thak Bhokta Vahasted from Mirchaiya Forest in The Garu Police Station Area to Friday.
 </p>
<p>
  “We got a tip-off about the presence of CPI (Maoist) regional committee member Chhotu Kharwar in Lohargarha and Mirchaiya forest with his squad to carry out some operations aimed at causing harm to the security forces during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Accordingly, a team was sent to the forest,” the SP said.
 </p>
<p>
  As a squad of cadres belonging to the Maoist party saw the police personnel, they started running away but the sub-zonal commander could not escape from there and he was caught, the police official remarked.

        That Salvini's ordinance, with which he imposed the 4 -hour reduction in the strike of the whole day of 15.12,2023 of the Autoferrotranvieri, was a real abuse of power was clear to the whole category, fighting to improve the wage conditions , regulations, security and against privatizations.

<div dir="auto" style="text-align: start;">
        On the other hand, the Autoferrotranvieri had already undergone an order to reduce the strike of 27.11.2023, deciding to postpone it to 15.12.2023.

        Now also the Tar of Lazio has recognized the legitimacy of that mobilization of 15.12.2023 and the illegitimacy of the order to reduce the strike issued by Salvini, considering it, in fact, a real abuse of power of the minister who intervened without one Founded reason for urgency and without "the existence in the concrete of the substantial assumptions to provide".

        In reality, as the acronyms of the basic unions had denounced that they had unitary the mobilization of 15.12.2023 united, Salvini abused the power conferred on him by art. 8 of L.146/90 and L.83/00 - rules that limit the exercise of the right of strike in Italy - just to do its election campaign, as a minister capable of using the iron fist against workers the exercise of the "right of rights" such as strike.

        Now, given that the contested ordinance was adopted without the prior reporting by the Commission, the clear explicit of the special reasons of necessity and urgency, relating to facts that occurred that occurred, occurred close to the abstention, such as to legitimize the 'officious intervention of the minister.

        Except that, no adequate indication in this sense is given to find in the opponent's provision, in which the dicastery has limited itself to referring to facts and circumstances already known by the Commission and evidently not considered suitable to concretize the invitation to provide ex art. 8 L.N. 146/1990.

        This is to be said, in particular: (i) for the concentration in the same time slot of the various collective abstention initiatives; ii) for the concrete effects of the strike, taking into account the intermodal transport system and the intensity of traffic No. 16464/2023 REG.RIC. passengers on the days of the agitation; (iii) for the inconveniences of strikes, which followed one another at the same time; iv) for the adverse weather conditions, which affected part of the country, an element which, if it had occurred, could at most have legitimized a more territorially circumscribed intervention, in homage to the principle of proportionality (see pages 2 and 3 of the ordinance for these aspects).

<span>
   From 
  A CGIL study is clear that workers wages are much more 
  low compared to France and Germany. Landini should be the first to 
  ask yourself why since he guides the strongest union of this

  Dear workers against, together with a 
 renunciation unionism, who does not decide or does not want to “disintegrate 
  the ax of war "(metaphor from the stories about the redsmanship) there are 
 At least 2 boulders that structurally keep wages in Italy low, 
 long before the situation worsened with Renzi's Jobs Act and the 
 "Reform" of Fornero.
  <br>
  One of these boulders dates back to the abolition 
 of the "escalator" 1992 (which indexed wages to the caravan) and 
 the other is made up of the "Biagi law" 2003, with its "variety" of 
 "atypical" contractual types.
  <br>
  In 2002 the year before the launch 
 of the Biagi law, out of a total of 15,849,000 employees,
  <span>
</span>
</br></br></p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 84% were full -time permanent contract, 13,300,000 workers.
 <br>
 20 
  years later in 2022, the total of employee workers arrives at 
 18,123,000 (plus 14.3%) or increases by 2,274,000. But inside them i 
  permanent full -time employees, drop by 842 thousand, going down 
 from 84% of 2022 to 68% in 2022.
 <br/>
 Conversely, employees with 
so-called "atypical" precarious contracts (including part-time contracts of which 
58% are involuntary) have doubled from 16% in 2002 to 32% in 2002. 
2022.
 <br/>
 In this basic context, 11 million are proliferated 
 precarious workers, (of which 10 in the private sector) are today 58.6% 
 of employees!
 <br/>
 But for the government it is not a scandal, much less an emergency!
 <br/>
 THE 
  wages in Italy are low first of all because it is the hourly wage it is 
  low! Even before the comparison of the hours worked with other countries.
 <br/>
 This
 it should be remembered in the face of the data of the CGIL study which denounces how, 
despite the record for hours worked in Italy, 1,563 on average per year 
in 2022, compared to 1,295 for a German and 1,427 for a French, corresponds to
 the following gap in payroll: 31,500 euros gross average in Italy, 
€45,500 in Germany, €41,700 in France.
 <br/>
 In Italy there are 10 
 millions of workers in the private sector with paycheck under 17 thousand 
 Euro gross per year. Among these 5.7 million employees below 10,700 
  Euro, which means just over 800 euros gross per month.
 <br/>
 Even though 
purchasing power, while inflation accumulated between the 
2021 and 2023 was 17.3%, wages recovered some of it
 Paltry. More than half of employees continue to 
have their employment contract renewed, which has expired for 5 to 10 years.
 <br/>
 The 
  confederal union has a ball to the foot inside, which does not 
 wants the direct clash or with the natural counterparty, the 
 industrial; nor with the Meloni government. This takes advantage of it, snubs and 
  It reduces the meetings and requests of the same to pure formality 
 confederal union.
 <br/>
 Everything will go on like this until the 
 collective mobilization of workers and workers will not put in 
 crisis union attentiveness, and then the Meloni government will serve 
 truly a helmet to protect themselves from the anger of those who, while working on 
  full rhythm he cannot get to the end of the month, as long as he takes home 
  Skin.

  Involved
 in the F-35 program from 2003 during the System Development and 
Demonstration phase. The company has since been given numerous contracts
 to deliver specialised F-35 aircraft ground support equipment for all 
three F-35 variants. Varley works with both Lockheed Martin and Northrop
 Grumman on the program. It designed and manufactures the landing gear 
handling system and canopy maintenance sling assembly for Lockheed 
Martin, achieving the status of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
for these items. In 2008, Varley was also contracted by LM to design and
 develop a field use variant of the landing gear handling system in 
addition to the original variant used at military bases. In 2015, Varley
 signed a long term agreement with Lockheed Martin. For Northrop 
Grumman, from 2005, Varley designed and has manufactured the F-35’s 
aircraft maintenance sling. (Source:

  Broens
 had been one of the first Australian companies involved in the F-35 
program, starting in 2004. It undertook a limited amount of work 
directly for Lockheed Martin, but most of its JSF work was through BAE 
Systems plc, including the manufacture of fixtures and composite tooling
 for the vertical tail. Broens also won an international multi-million 
dollar tender by Pratt &amp; Whitney to design and manufacture the 
engine gearbox lift. In 2012, Broens was reported as manufacturing 
multiple units of the lift. It was expected that ultimately every JSF 
squadron globally would have one or more; an estimated global total of 
150 lifts. (Sources:

  NO
 LONGER EXISTS IN AUSTRALIA employed a full range of capabilities in 
airframe structural analysis and design, electrical engineering and 
systems installation design and was central to the success of Australian
 industry involvement in the F-35 program.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2002, GKN AES 
decided to actively pursue work on the F-35 and was the first company to
 receive a contract in the program. In November 2003, it was awarded a 
contract by Northrop Grumman for 18 staff (nine based in the US) to 
support the design, analysis and manufacture of F-35 centre fuselage 
parts for 15 months. The contract expanded over the next three years 
peaking during 2006 with over 220 GKN AES designers and engineers being 
part of the F-35 program, of which more than 90 per cent were based in 
Australia.
 </p>
<p>
  The company worked for both Lockheed Martin and 
Northrop Grumman on all three variants of the F-35. It accumulated one 
million engineering hours designing some 3,000 distinct parts for the 
F-35 which amounted to 12 per cent of the airframe by part number.
 </p>
<p>
  In
 2009, GKN’s engineering services activities were sold to an Indian 
engineering firm which decided to close the Australian operation. Even 
so, there remain a large number of Australian aerospace engineers with 
significantly enhanced experience spread throughout Australian industry 
and the aerospace industry globally. (

  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Philippines raises high the Red banner of the national democratic revolution and, in behalf of all Party cadres and members, revolutionaries and activists, gives its firmest salute to all the Red commanders, fighters and militia forces, as we celebrate the very important and joyous occasion of the 55th anniversary of the New People's Army.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Today, let us look back at our accomplishments and shortcomings during the past year, draw lessons from these, and forge plans to make bigger achievements in waging revolutionary armed struggle against the US-Marcos fascist and puppet regime in the coming year.
  <br/>
<br/>
  On this occasion, let us remember and honor all the heroes and martyrs of the Philippine revolution who sacrificed everything for the Filipino people's cause for the national and social liberation. Let us extol their lives and be inspired by their martyrdom. What better way of honoring their memory than by continuing the revolutionary cause that they helped advance?
  <br/>
<br/>
  The Central Committee is happy to inform everyone that the call for a rectification movement which the Party issued last December has been wholeheartedly welcomed by all regional Party committees and commands of the NPA. They have responded positively and are presently carrying out summing-up conferences and study meetings to identify the errors and shortcomings in order to rectify these, and steadily and comprehensively carry forward all revolutionary tasks.
  <br/>
<br/>
  We need to exert all out effort for the revolution to be carried forward in order to defend the interests of the Filipino masses who are being subjected to worsening forms of oppression and exploitation by the US-Marcos regime. The country faces the real and increasing danger of being dragged into an inter-imperialist war. The need to advance the revolutionary armed struggle, in particular, is of great urgency, being the most important weapon of the Filipino people to fight for their revolutionary cause.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Conditions of crisis in the country are impelling the oppressed and exploited masses of the Filipino people to carry forward their struggles. Under the guidance of the Party, the revolutionary forces are determined to arouse, organize and mobilize the Filipino people in great numbers, steadily bring forward the national democratic revolution, and bring it to unparalleled heights in the future, facing all the needed sacrifice and hardships.

  Take initiative to set the armed struggle to blaze! Frustrate the enemy's all-out onslaught

<br/>
<br/>
  The revolutionary armed struggle being waged by the New People's Army (NPA) under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines is at a critical juncture. Party cadres, Red commanders and fighters, revolutionary mass organizations and activists in the countryside and in the cities, are called upon to boldly shoulder our urgent tasks, raise high the Red banner of the revolution, set the armed struggle ablaze, lift it from its current state of adversity and emerge stronger than ever before.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 We must consider the following: On the one hand, there is urgent need to carry out armed struggle in order to strike blows against the enemy in the face of heightened imperialist economic aggression and military intervention and intensified fascist onslaught. The enemy's declared aim of "ending the armed conflict" seeks to pave the way for the unmitigated trampling of the country's sovereignty and out-and-out oppression of the Filipino people.
 <br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand, our forces have been weakened to a large extent by internal errors, weaknesses and shortcomings as a result of years of military conservatism and passivity. Guided by the Party, NPA units are currently undertaking crucial efforts at rectification and consolidation with the aim of overcoming past setbacks, breaking out of military passivity, preserving and expanding their forces, and reinvigorating guerrilla warfare.
 <br/>
<br/>
 To confront this particular situation, we must firmly grasp the dialectical relationship between fighting the enemy and strengthening our forces: we must strengthen the NPA to effectively fight the enemy; we must fight the enemy to effectively strengthen the NPA. We cannot divorce one from the other. The former is quite plain to see and need not be elaborated further; but the latter is not quite as obvious, and some may even argue otherwise.
 <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 When we speak of waging armed struggle and fighting the enemy, we mean striking blows at the enemy's armed forces, employing all kinds of weapons in the hands of the guerrilla forces and the people. We mean primarily mounting basic tactical offensives that we are capable of winning, that weakens the enemy by annihilating its armed forces piece by piece, and takes away its weapons in order that we can arm more recruits and mount even bigger tactical offensives in the future. We raise the capability of the NPA to wage war by waging war.
 <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 In the face of the current onslaught of the enemy, NPA commands at front and provincial or subregional levels, must plan to wage an active defense warfare at the level of campaigns and battles, anticipate the enemy's deployment and strike at its weakest parts. They must be ready to shift its main forces or center of gravity out of the enemy's encirclement, while leaving or dispatching teams or composite units to carry various kinds of guerrilla actions and tactical offensives that they are capable of winning and inflicting serious damage on the enemy.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Given the current situation, it is paramount for units of the NPA and people's militias at all levels to take the initiative to plan out tactical offensives that they are capable of mounting and winning. These initiatives must be carried out in coordination with the higher command and nearby units. Tactical offensives and guerrilla actions can range from laying out an ambush against the enemy's reconnaissance units, perimeter defense or supply lines, attacking his isolated outposts, disarming, sniping, demolition, partisan and arrest operations, imposing sanctions, meting out justice on counterrevolutionaries and criminal antisocial elements, and so on. These tactical offensives must succeed in seizing the enemy's rifles and war matériel, destroying their supply and communication lines, immobilizing their land, air and sea assets, disrupting the enemy's plans or blocking its advance, and drawing away the enemy's attention from the main direction and plans of the main forces of the NPA.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The task of mounting tactical offensives that we are capable of winning must be carried out with meticulous planning and utmost vigor, as a way of galvanizing the NPA, and as the first decisive step at rectification.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Along the line of waging extensive and intensive guerrilla warfare on an ever widening and deepening mass base, all units of the people's army and people's militias are called upon to take full military and political initiative, and exercise flexibility in their actions. The NPA must strengthen and expand their ties with the masses. They must defend the peasant masses and people against their fascist oppressors and exploiters, and carry out widespread propaganda, organizing and mobilization to advance their antifeudal mass struggles and carry out land reform.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Majority of the NPA platoons must be deployed to help consolidate and expand guerrilla fronts, and build more company-sized guerrilla fronts. Guerrilla platoons must forge a clear plan to dispatch its units within a given radius that is limited at a given time to avoid overdispersal, but wide enough for defensive and offensive maneuvers, with a clear time frame to advance wave upon wave, or expand the revolutionary mass base on the basis of consolidation. We expand the NPA's area of operations by methods of advancing in waves or by secretly leapfrogging to relatively favorable areas where it can start arousing, organizing and mobilizing the people to gain foothold. We can always dispatch NPA units in a trailblazing missions to initiate guerilla warfare and open new guerilla zones where the enemy least suspect and expect.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Together with peasant mass organizations, territorial Party committees and other revolutionary forces, the NPA must carry out campaigns of social investigation in order to identify the most urgent issues and problems of the masses, and accelerate efforts in arousing, organizing and mobilizing the peasant masses, advancing their urgent democratic demands, linking these with their agrarian revolutionary movement and the people's democratic revolution.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We must pay attention to building or rebuilding the organs of political power at the village and higher levels on the foundations of the full-fledged mass organizations of peasants, women, youth, cultural workers and other toiling people covering barrios or cluster of barrios or municipalities, as well as local branches and section committees of the Party. Many of these organs of political power have been targeted by the enemy's armed suppression. We must sum up our experiences and come up with policies to ensure that the organs of political power, mass organizations, local mass leaders are secured and kept out from the enemy's intelligence radar.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We must consolidate and strengthen the mass base and forge plans to raise their militance to assert their civil, political, social and economic rights, and to collectively and resolutely expose and resist the enemy's dirty tactics. We must frustrate the enemy's despicable schemes to break up the unity of the people, force them to surrender one by one, or entice the Red commanders and fighters to forsake the masses with false promises of a better future. In fighting the enemy's suppression campaign, the local forces must not be left to themselves. Their struggle must be brought to a higher level in order to draw strength from numbers and from the solidarity of people, from adjacent villages to the international community. Above all, the NPA must make all efforts to demonstrate their determination to defend the people by striking at their fascist oppressors.
 <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 The NPA must help mount mass campaigns to mobilize the peasant masses on problems and issues that gravely affect them in common. These include land grabbing by big companies involved in mining, plantations, real estate, eco-tourism, energy and other infrastructure projects. They must also be organized and mobilized to address their problems in times of widespread flooding, drought or landslides and other disasters that destroy their livelihood. The peasant masses, mainly the poor peasants and farmworkers, must be organized and mobilized to fight for lowering land rent, eliminating usury, increasing farm wages, fair prices for farm produce and other urgent demands in line with the Party's antifeudal line and agrarian policy. The peasant masses must be organized in large numbers to raise their demands in town centers or cities.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Wherever they go, Red fighters and commanders of the NPA also carry out production, education, health and cultural campaigns in order to address the practical needs of the masses. They must continue to forge strong and inseparable bonds with the masses. They must at all times identify with the woes of the peasant masses and find solutions to the plight they are condemned to by their exploiters.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Units of the NPA must consolidate, strengthen and expand its forces. It is extremely critical that Red fighters and commanders unite with one mind and act as one body. To achieve this, they must take stock of their strengths and weaknesses, and plan out the measures necessary to raise the determination and capability of the Red fighters and the revolutionary masses to fight and frustrate the enemy's all-out attacks.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We must improve the command structure of the NPA at all levels, ensuring the quality and composition of unit commands of both horizontal and vertical forces, as well as regional and provincial or subregional territorial operations command. The leading core at every level of command of the NPA should be composed of commanders and fighters who are models of courage before the enemy and paragons of humility before the masses.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Our guerrilla forces must be able to conduct basic politico-military trainings, as well as officers' trainings in order to enhance the capability and knowledge of our Red fighters and commanders in military science and tactics, and further strengthen their commitment to serve the people. The system of trainings should be improved to allow for shorter or staggered courses in order to adapt to the fluid military situation amid the relentless enemy operations.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Units of the NPA should continue to master flexibility in changing their modes of action from concentration, dispersal and shifting, depending on the situation and their objectives. We concentrate our forces to attack the enemy and consolidate, disperse to conduct mass work, disappear before the enemy, and create more points of initiative, and shift to pursue plans for expansion, or to move out of enemy encirclement.
 <br/>
<br/>
 All units of the NPA must avoid unplanned battles and seek ways to make the enemy punch the air and exhaust himself. They must immediately and regularly assess their situation, patch all security holes and remove all vulnerabilities. They must diligently guard against the enemy's tactic of smuggling in electronic or GPS trackers. They must strengthen their determination to put into practice the principles and methods of secrecy in guerrilla movements, while marching or on bivouac. They must constantly maintain a high level of discipline and compliance with military regulations among its Red fighters, and a high degree of revolutionary political consciousness to strengthen their will to make the necessary sacrifices to maintain the NPA's security. They must subject to criticism and rectification all violations of security policies and regulations which compromise guerrilla secrecy.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The NPA must decisively smash the enemy's intelligence network hiding in plain sight among the masses, narrowing on ringleaders especially those who have committed grave crimes against the people. The masses, especially those who have borne the brunt of the enemy's suppression campaign, demand that renegade traitors who have been actively collaborating with the enemy as agents or spies, be subjected to revolutionary punishment, and that their criminal and counterrevolutionary misdeeds be thoroughly exposed.
 <br/>
<br/>
 All units of the NPA must assess the enemy's intelligence stock (built from information contained in compromised files, spilled by traitors, or accumulated through long periods of surveillance), and how this is linked to the conduct of the enemy's operations. They must make appropriate plans and adjustments in their plans to render the enemy's intelligence information unactionable or unusable.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The NPA must continue to follow strict rules in securing and protecting sensitive informations by observing compartmentalization, using ciphers and encryption, and paying attention to standing policies covering the regulated use of computers, smartphones, cellphones, two-way radios, and other electronic gadgets. We must also develop mastery of the art of disinformation and misdirection—including feeding the enemy's intelligence network or electronic surveillance with false positives—in order to confuse the enemy and frustrate its attacks.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We must carry out a campaign of proselytization aimed at the rank and file of the enemy, many of whom are of peasant, worker, semiproletariat or lower pettybourgeois origin, who were enticed to join the enemy's armed forces due to its high salaries. They are fully aware of the rotteness and corruption of the reactionary military organization, and harbor deep grievances over the abuses perpetrated against them by their superiors, as well as the gross crimes and violations of human rights which they are made to perpetrate against the masses. We must distribute leaflets and conduct open propaganda at military camps, detachments or stations. We can encourage the disgruntled ranks-and-file personnel of the enemy's military and police forces to leave their jobs, join the revolution, pass on valuable informations or live productive lives as civilians, and partake of the fruits of the collective labor of peasant mass organizations.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We must continue to build and strengthen the Party within the New People's Army to guide it in all its tasks. We must continue to recruit the most advanced elements and ensure their ideological, political and organizational training and development. Party committees must be built at the level of the companies; Party branches in platoons; and Party groups in squads. The Party must designate from its rank political officers and instructors at every NPA formation to ensure that politics commands the gun. We must also ensure the deployment of cadres and activists from the urban areas, especially from the ranks of workers, as well as students, teachers and other pettybourgeois intellectuals and professionals, in order to raise the capacity of the NPA in performing the various tasks of leadership and administration.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The above-stated tasks are critical and must be carried out with a high degree of urgency by Party cadres and Red commanders at the core and leadership of the New People's Army. It is most urgent to take military and political initiative in order to regain the guerrilla bearings of NPA units, especially those which have suffered setbacks in the past and forced into a passive position, frustrate the enemy's onslaught, and bring forward the revolutionary armed struggle. These tasks must be carried out by the Party and NPA as we carry forward the rectification movement to root out the ideological basis of past errors and weaknesses, in order to create the conditions for the renewed growth of the revolutionary armed struggle.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Reaffirm the basic principles of waging people's war in the Philippines
 <br/>
<br/>
 Every unit of the NPA must sum-up their experiences and rectify errors in line with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, guided by the overall self-critical analysis provided in the Central Committee's message on the Party's 55th anniversary and by the summing-up of experiences within the scope of their work and circumstance of their areas of operation. Units which have suffered setbacks must give particular attention to analyzing defensive battles in order to identify their errors and weaknesses. We must learn from the lessons paid for dearly by the blood of our martyrs as one way of honoring their sacrifices.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The 55th anniversary of the NPA is a most propitious occasion to reaffirm the basic principles and theory of waging people's war in the Philippines. This is especially important as we face a critical situation following serious setbacks over the past years, which demand us to rectify our errors and weaknesses.
 <br/>
<br/>
 By applying Marxism-Leninism-Maoism on the concrete conditions of the country, the Party developed the theory of waging people's war in the Philippines, and led the New People's Army in waging revolutionary armed struggle from one level to another. The 1974 article, Specific Characteristics of Our People's War, laid out the basic theory, principles, program and plan for waging revolutionary war in Philippines. It took into consideration the semicolonial and semifeudal system, the archipelagic character of its geographic and physical terrain, as well as other specific characteristics of the country.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Our accomplishments in revolutionary practice over the past 55 years are concrete proof of the correctness of these theories. Further proof of the validity of these theories are the setbacks and losses which we have incurred as a result of our failure to steadfastly hold on to these theories.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The correctness of the national democratic revolution has been proven in practice by waging revolutionary armed struggle in the countryside as the principal form of struggle, and the revolutionary mass movement combining legal and illegal forms of struggles in the cities and countryside, as the secondary but indispensable form of struggle. By upholding the national democratic line, we have succeeded in building a mass base of several million people, under the firm leadership of the proletariat, realizing the basic alliance of workers and peasants mainly through the Party's leadership of the NPA, and building the national united front to fight imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism, with the aim of overthrowing the ruling reactionary state of big bourgeois compradors and big landlords.
 <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 Over the past 55 years, we have overcome the greatest difficulties and obstacles in waging people's war in the Philippines as an archipelagic country. We have succeeded in self-reliantly developing guerrilla warfare on a nationwide scale despite the disadvantage of having no physical rear. We have established guerilla fronts and consolidated rural bases with fairly strong units of the NPA in all the major islands of the country. These guerilla fronts have served as theaters for NPA units to wage guerrilla warfare. They create guerrilla zones and bases first in the less-populated mountainous terrain, where they could consolidate, train and plan to expand to the better-populated plains, riverine, main lines of transportation and coastal areas.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Starting with only 60 Red fighters armed with only nine automatic rifles and 26 inferior firearms in the second district of Tarlac province, we have succeeded in developing our forces from squads and platoons, to company-strength guerrilla forces. We have created 14 regional commands of the NPA, each having reached a peak strength of a few hundred to more or less a thousand Red fighters, and each having a number of subregional or provincial commands with several guerrilla fronts.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The Philippine national democratic revolution has had the distinction of having advanced with great strides and waging armed struggle in the current era of international retreat of the world proletariat. With the defeat of the socialist revolution and capitalist restoration in China and the Soviet Union under modern revisionist rule, the Filipino people had to wage and self-reliantly develop revolutionary armed struggle.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We have established Red political power across thousands of villages across the country. We have built the rudimentary forms of the people's democratic government at the barrio or inter-barrio level, with officers elected in village assemblies or selected from local revolutionary mass organizations.
 <br/>
<br/>
 We have waged guerrilla warfare across the country by adopting the policy of relative centralized strategic command and decentralized operations in campaigns and battles. Through the past decades, regional committees of the Party and regional commands of the NPA have developed home-grown cadres and commanders of high quality capable of self-reliantly leading the comprehensive range of revolutionary tasks, along the line set by the Central Committee. Many of them have been promoted to the Central Committee of the Party and the National Operations Command of the NPA.
 <br/>
<br/>
 As we carry out a rectification movement, it is critical for all cadres of the Party, commanders and fighters of the NPA, and all revolutionary forces to reaffirm our basic analysis of the semicolonial and semifeudal system in the country, and the basic principles and theories of waging the people's democratic revolution in the Philippines through protracted people's war along the strategic line of encircling the cities from the countryside; to study the history of waging revolutionary struggle during the past 55 years in order to draw lessons from its accomplishments and setbacks; to have a long view of the tasks that lie ahead for advancing the revolutionary forces quantitatively and qualitatively, until we can turn the current balance of forces into its opposite.
 <br/>
<br/>
 As the Party has established, the protracted people's war in the Philippines will go through three probable stages of development: the strategic defensive, the strategic stalemate; and the strategic offensive. This route of the progress of the people's war in the Philippines is determined by dialectical laws of development. To desire another route or fail to push along the path is almost certainly fatal.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the 1980s, unremoulded petty bourgeois elements in the leadership of the Party harbored notions of a shortcut to a quick victory. They questioned the basic analysis of the Party of the semicolonial and semifeudal system, promoted the idea that the Marcos dictatorship industrialized and turned the country into a capitalist country, exaggerated the country's urbanization and downplayed the extent of the agrarian economy by citing false government statistics.
 <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 Alongside with the "Left" opportunists were various strands of Right opportunists who rejected the necessity of waging revolutionary armed struggle. In the late 1980s, some promoted the line of "popular democracy" who ultimately consolidated themselves in "non-governmental organizations" promoting reformism and class collaboration. They will be later joined by the "Left" opportunists who, after failing in their line of insurrectionism and military adventurism, served as NGO bureaucrats in the so-called "civil society" community. Still others engaged in "peace talks" to facilitate their surrender to the reactionary regime, with some allowed to maintain paramilitary forces to fight the NPA, while engaging in various types of criminal activities.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It took the Second Great Rectification Movement to salvage the revolutionary guerrilla forces from suffering further grave losses. Reaffirming the Party's basic principles of waging people's democratic revolution through protracted people's war, units of the NPA were reorganized to attain a correct balance of horizontal and vertical forces, in order to effectively carry out both political and military work. The Party affirmed the tactical military line of waging extensive and intensive guerrilla warfare on the basis of an ever widening and deepening mass base within the stage of the strategic defensive.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The New People's Army has successfully frustrated the yearly declared targets of the enemy to crush the revolutionary armed movement. It surmounted the successive campaigns of encirclement and suppression including the Oplan Katatagan, Oplan Lambat Bitag I, II and III, Oplan Gordian Knot, Oplan Makabayan, Oplan Bantay Laya I and II, Oplan Bayanihan and Oplan Kapayapaan and have, by and large, emerged stronger. The Party leadership estimated that the people's war reached the middle phase of the strategic defensive in and around the middle of the 2000s, and made plans to fulfill the requirements to reach the advanced phase, and onto the threshold of the strategic stalemate.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Even then, however, we had been bogged down by problems of military conservatism which has kept things stuck at the middle phase. Years of conservatism in all aspects of revolutionary work, and complacency have led to self-constriction of the people's army and a slow weakening and reduction of the mass base, making it vulnerable to enemy encirclement and suppression, leading to setbacks and losses. One of the detrimental effects of empiricism has been our inability to quickly draw lessons from experience in order to raise the level of our knowledge and theory, from the level of the NPA's national command down to the regions and fronts, resulting in failure to adapt to changes in the enemy's tactics, and in mistakes being committed repeatedly.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Under the leadership of the Central Committee, the entire Party, the New People's Army and all revolutionary forces are currently carrying out a rectification movement to identify and get rid the bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideological roots of our past errors, weaknesses and shortcomings, reaffirm our proletarian standpoint, viewpoint and methods in order to more resolutely carry forward the revolution.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The current rectification movement is fundamentally a study movement to review and reaffirm the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism as contained in the classic writings of the great communist teachers, and those of Ka Jose Maria Sison; to study the Party's Constitution and Program; to study the documents of the Party's First and Second Great Rectification Movement; to sum-up experiences of the past five and 25 years; to conduct a campaign of social investigation and class analysis; to carry out criticism and self-criticism; to evaluate the performances of Party cadres; and to fully implement the Three-Level Party Course.
 <br/>
<br/>
 All regional committees and organs of the Party, and commands of the NPA have welcomed the call for a rectification movement since the Central Committee issued it last December 26, 2023. Summing-up and study sessions, social investigation conferences and planning meetings, have been held or are scheduled to be conducted by various Party committee and NPA commands at all levels. At the same time, the necessary redeployment of forces of the NPA is being carried out in order to address the various forms of self-constriction, expand the scope of the NPA's operations, open new areas outside the enemy's encirclement, fight fascist suppression in the old areas, and vigorously arouse, organize and mobilize the peasant masses.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The declaration of the rectification movement in December frustrated the US-Marcos regime and the reactionary state which had wishful thoughts that the Party was on the brink of capitulation following the capture and murder of some key leaders of the Party, as well as the passing away of Ka Joma, the Party's founding chair and guiding light. In response, the enemy poured even greater amounts of funds and resources to its counterrevolutionary war and has further intensified its campaign of encirclement and suppression. This has now taken the form of relentless and widespread campaigns of armed suppression against peasant communities, aerial bombing and artillery shelling and large-scale combat operations in scores of guerrilla fronts across the country.
 <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
 Inspired by the rectification movement, Party leaders and NPA fighters have become more fearless and determined despite the great disparity in the current balance of forces. We can more deeply recognize that the enemy's superiority in terms of US-supplied weaponry is countervailed by the rottenness and moribund state of the system it is defending; and that the NPA's inferiority in terms of weaponry is countervailed by its superiority in terms of the widespread support of the Filipino masses. Armed with dialectical method of thinking, we also recognize that this situation is temporary, and will ultimately be negated, as the people's war advances from its current stage to the next and the enemy gets further embroiled in irresoluble crisis of imperialism and the ruling semicolonial and semifeudal system.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Crisis and oppression rouses people's resistance against the US-Marcos regime
 <br/>
<br/>
 The US-Marcos regime is the current concentrated expression of the Filipino people's oppressor. It represents the moribund ruling system and the worst facets of the ruling exploiting classes. Its neoliberal economic policies, outright subservience to US geopolitical interests, corruption, high-style living, and fascist suppression of democratic rights are causing even greater suffering on the Filipino people and rousing them to fight for national democracy with even greater tenacity.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Marcos' economic policies outrightly favor the interests of foreign monopoly capitalists and banks, big bourgeois compradors and big landlords, which bring great misery to the Filipino masses. In compliance with the neoliberal policy dictates of imperialist banks and other financial agencies, the Marcos regime has further liberalized trade and investment policies, and deregulated social and environmental policies. These policies have resulted in further debilitating local manufacturing and agricultural production, mass unemployment, greater dependence on imports, higher prices of food and other basic commodities, bigger budget deficits, a sharp increase in the country's debt and worsening tax burden on the people.
 <br/>
<br/>
 These policies have aggravated the already gross socioeconomic conditions of the people. To favor the profit-greed of foreign and local big capitalists, the Marcos regime is keeping workers' daily wages low, which has fallen way below the cost of living of workers and their families. Marcos is allowing big bourgeois compradors and big landlords to dispossess the peasant masses, indigenous people, fisherfolk, transport workers and other toiling people of their land and other means of livelihood. Public school teachers, medical workers, and other rank and file employees and ordinary professionals suffer from low salaries. Millions upon millions of people are without jobs and economically displaced. Thousands upon thousands everyday are forced to leave the country to search for work overseas.
 <br/>
<br/>
 To gain the favors of foreign monopoly capitalists, particularly US and European capitalists, Marcos displays absolute subservience to the imperialist US. He has allowed the US military to expand the permanent presence of hundreds of American combat troops and stationing of missile systems and other war matériel inside the military camps, airports, sea ports, and other strategic locations in the country under the cover of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). The build up of US military presence in the country is in line with its "first island chain" plan to contain the military and economic expansion of its imperialist rival China.
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Over the past year, the US military has aggressively employed the AFP and Coast Guard forces to carry out resupply missions, joint patrols and other types of naval activity in the West Philippine Sea, and fortify its presence especially in the outlying Philippine islands. These are being projected as part of Philippine assertion of its territorial rights in an attempt to dupe the Filipino people, but in fact, form part of US plans to use the Philippines as a pawn in its game-plan  against China. In its drive push back US military build-up around its country, imperialist China has encroached and violated Philippine maritime territory and economic sovereignty, and is committing increasingly aggressive actions against the Philippines.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The situation of rising inter-imperialist rivalries is rousing the Filipino people to defend the country's freedom and demand the imperialist giants - both the US and China - to end their saber-rattling and withdraw their troops from the country's territory. So far, the anti-imperialist revolutionary armed struggle of the Filipino people is the biggest factor preventing an inter-imperialist war from erupting in the region. To the US imperialists, the NPA is a critical impediment that prevents it from fully using the country as springboard for aggresion and using the AFP as pawn in its scheme of stoking military tensions in the South China Sea and dragging the country into a conflict with China in line with its geopolitical interests.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Marcos' generals have declared their aim of dismantling all NPA guerrilla fronts by the end of March, all NPA vertical units by the end of June, and all regional Party committees by the end of the year. The narrow timeline set by Marcos has compelled its ground units to direct its unparalleled vicious wrath against the people with terror campaigns of armed suppression against peasant communities, aerial bombing and artillery shelling and large-scale combat operations in scores of guerrilla fronts across the country. The AFP has become increasingly brazen in extrajudicial killings of civilians and counting them as NPA casualties, as part of its bloody psywar campaign. Like in the US war of aggression in Vietnam, the puppet Marcos and the AFP are conjuring illusions of winning the war for the hearts and minds of the people, harping on bloated, fabricated or rehashed battlefield victories.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Under its National Security Strategy for 2023-2028, the Marcos regime is also employing all means of armed and legal suppression against unions, peasant and semiproletariat mass organizations, anti-mining and environmental advocates, human rights defenders, student associations, cultural groups, alternative media outfits, religious personalities and other progressive individuals both in the cities and rural areas. Marcos has poured billions of pesos for "intelligence operations" resulting in a marked increase in cases of surveillance, abductions, arrests and harassments against social activists.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Marcos rules with martial law methods without its formal declaration in the guise of "fighting terrorism." On the surface, the ruling system appears strong with its use of outright armed repression, but this, in fact, is a clear manifestation of the weakness or inability of the ruling system to rule on the basis of pseudo-democratic persuasion, and its desperation to perpetuate the system based on oppression and exploitation. As did his dictator father, Marcos Jr's employment of brutal tactics of suppression will ultimately prove counterproductive as he can succeed only in further inciting the people's anger and setting fire to their desire to fight back with arms and join the NPA.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The ruling political system is also further weakened by the deepening contradictions among rival factions of the ruling class as all sides become increasingly greedy over the limited spoils and time for bureaucratic corruption. The verbal tussle between the main factions of the ruling clique, the Marcoses and Dutertes, are becoming virulent, especially as they elbow one another in preparation for the 2025 elections. They are on a course of mutual destruction.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The Marcos regime, much detested for its illegitimate claim to power through the 2022 election fraud, is further isolating itself from the people. It has displayed gross disregard for the people's plight, inaction and ineptness amid droughts, floods, landslides and other calamities, while wasting money in successive foreign trips with nothing to gain but mostly empty promises of so-called investments in exchange for assurances of exploiting Filipino workers and resources. It is also rousing people's protests over its attempt to amend the 1987 constitution to enshrine neoliberal policies and attempt to satisfy its desires to perpetuate itself in Malacañang.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The US-Marcos regime is inciting the people's outrage and generating conditions for mass resistance. By waging persevering and militant struggle, a broad anti-fascist united front can rise with great force and engulf the Marcos II regime, just as the Marcos I dictatorship was tossed away in 1986 by the powerful wave of armed resistance and mass protests that grew from years of arduous struggles.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The Party and all revolutionary forces must serve as the solid core and stand at the forefront of the antifascist, anti-imperialist and antifeudal mass struggles of the broad masses of the Filipino people in both the cities and countryside. The situation calls for untiring efforts to arouse, organize and mobilize the people in order to advance their demands for wage increases and land distribution, and other urgent reforms to alleviate their misery and sufferings, and to defend their political, social, economic and cultural rights against intensified oppression under the US-Marcos regime.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The economic and political struggles of the broad masses of the people must be directed against the US-Marcos regime in order to expose its subservience and fascism, isolate and fight it. The urgent demands of the people must be tightly joined to the struggle for national democracy. Furthermore, the revolutionary mass movement of legal and illegal forms of propaganda, organizing and struggle, must be firmly linked with the revolutionary armed struggle by rousing the people, especially the youth, to join the New People's Army or provide it with all possible political, material and moral support to wage all-out armed resistance and bring renewed vigor the people's democratic revolution.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Anti-imperialist resistance amid sharpening world contradictions
 <br/>
<br/>
 Despite the distance and geographical separation, the revolutionary struggle in the Philippines is closely bound to the revolutionary struggles of the working class and toiling people around the world. The accomplishments and victories of the people's democratic revolution in the Philippines are not ours alone, but belong as well to the workers, peasants and all toiling people in other countries. In the same breadth, we celebrate the victories and accomplishments of all the oppressed and exploited classes as they wage revolutionary struggle against imperialism, neocolonialism, fascism and all forms of reaction.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Workers struggles and mass resistance continue to grow and spread across various countries amid the continuing global capitalist crisis, economic stagnation, large-scale joblessness, sharp deterioration of living conditions, sharpening social inequities, intensifying imperialist interventionism, and rising inter-imperialist conflict leading to costly military conflicts and wars.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Across the centers of international capitalism, workers and other democratic classes continue to rise up in numbers as they demand wage increases and better working conditions, and fight back against imperialist war and oppression. Democratic mass struggles continue to erupt in the United States, where the number of strikes rose sharply last year as workers and toiling people face high rates of inflation. Workers in Europe have staged even bigger mass demonstrations and coordinated strikes demanding wage increases.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Since last year, millions of people across the world have joined mass demonstrations condemning the US and Zionist Israel for the genocidal war against the people of Palestine in Gaza. There is also rising opposition to continuing extension of large amounts of military aid of US and NATO countries to prolong the war in Ukraine against Russia. Worsening forms of imperialist oppression are rousing people to build anti-imperialist organizations, formations and centers for cooperation and coordination, and wage campaigns and struggles against imperialist interventionism, rising military spending, war provocations and preparations.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Armed resistance continues to rage across various countries. In Myanmar, ethnic armies are waging guerrilla warfare against the fascist Tatmadaw regime. There are revolutionary armed struggles led by Marxist-Leninist forces in Colombia, India, Kurdistan, Palestine, Peru, the Philippines, Turkey and other countries. There are prevalent conditions for waging protracted people's war across a large number of countries.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Revolutionary proletarian forces across the world continue to consolidate and exert efforts to build communist parties on the theoretical foundations of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. They carry out theoretical studies to sum-up their histories and conduct social investigation, and engage in widespread propaganda and organizing to strike deep roots among the workers and other oppressed and exploited classes.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The insoluble imperialist crisis is generating conditions that are rousing millions of people to wage all forms of resistance. It is a matter of time that Marxist-Leninist forces, through painstaking work, will position themselves at the vanguard of mass movements and armed struggles and forge a new era of a resurgence of socialist and people's democratic revolutionary worldwide.

<p>
   Since 1988, International Domestic Workers Day has been celebrated every March 30. This day draws attention to the contribution of a workforce that is vital to the survival of the human species and society as a whole.
  </p>
<p>
   However, despite its social importance, domestic work is a work very marked by labor precariousness and lack of decent conditions, particularly in Latin America and the Caribbean, where around 15 million women face high informality rates , low wages and long days, according to statements by the ILO director, Gilbert Houngbo.
  </p>
<p>
   In Colombia, the figures are alarming: according to the great integrated survey of households 2019, 7 % of the employment of women in Colombia is concentrated in paid domestic work; Thus, 688,000 people were engaged in this work, because in 5.6 % of Colombian households hire people to carry out domestic work in a paid manner. 94 % of people who are dedicated to paid domestic work are women (647,000), with an 83 % informality rate. Of every 10 women dedicated to paid domestic work 6 (62 %) earn a minimum or even less salary and only 17 % of total women (111,000) have access to social security.
  </p>
<p>
   According to the Ministry of Labor, 80 % of domestic workers do not quote pensions in Colombia, 77 % receive foods such as payment in kind and 99 % do not receive extra hours; This despite that since 1985 the payment of social security (health and pension) is mandatory for these workers, but the bourgeois law regarding workers' rights is dead letter.
  </p>
<p>
   In December 2018, the Integrated Contribution Settlement Form only recorded the health payments of 102,123 domestic service workers, while 99,978 were in occupational risks and only 94,079 in pensions. In other words, the majority of those engaged in paid domestic work in the country are denied access to basic rights such as social security. Similarly, most domestic workers do not have signed contracts in writing and are exposed to unsafe working conditions for their health, as well as abuse and violence, including sexual violence, inside the homes where they work.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, a recent ILO and DANE investigation, about the gender work gap in 2021, revealed that paid domestic workers earn 27 % less than the small number of men who exercise that same work.
  </p>
<p>
   As if all this were not enough, child exploitation is unfortunately frequent in domestic work: the Ministry of Labor reported that in 2013 more than 20,000 minors were domestic workers (14,000 per day and 6,000 in the form of interns). Likewise, according to the same DANE, as of December 2018, 475,000 people between the ages of 5 and 17 performed domestic work for more than 15 hours or more during the week.
  </p>
<p>
   And these figures do not surprise us if we take into account the definance of rural education by the very petty Ministry of Education that each school closes thousands of rural schools or reduces the number of teachers who attend them; and from the forced displacement of the countryside to the city, on account of the bloody reactionary war. In the last decade the number of displaced women dedicated to domestic work went from 7.4 % to 12.5 %; Above, these women generally lack conditions to enter the formal market, since 4.9 % of them have no educational level, 38.6 % only have primary and 22.5 % ended baccalaureate
   <sup>
    One
   </sup>
   . Thus, many do not see another way than to devote themselves to domestic work.
  </p>
<p>
   Likewise, other scourges of capitalist society are evident in the conditions of this sector of the working class: given the structural racism of the system, domestic workers generally belong to Afro or indigenous communities, which are also the communities most forgotten by the bourgeois state and who have suffered the reactionary war that has stripped them of their ancestral territories.
  </p>
<p>
   On the other hand, despite all this situation, and although bourgeois feminism has had a significant impulse in recent years, sectors of working women - such as domestic service workers - have not been represented in the slogans that are raised in emblematic dates such as March 8 and November 25, even on those of May 1; Hence, more attention to their struggles to: achieve the training of domestic workers, labor inspection in intermediary companies and households, the creation of a national care system, collective bargaining to guarantee decent conditions of working and rights; the recognition of their rights in terms of health and pension; and against: discrimination, violence and sexual abuse.
  </p>
<p>
   And this feeling of the most superxploited women by the capitalist system, is shared by many proletarians from other branches of production, and becomes a call to revolutionaries and communists to take more rigorously and commitment to give it a truly revolutionary to March 8 and to the entire female movement.
  </p>
<p>
   The woman's struggle for her liberation is necessarily linked to conquering the concrete conditions that allow her to exercise her power and creative capacity in society; For this, it is essential that the revolutionary get to the head of the female movement and direct the proletarians to the conquest of concrete and real material conditions to guarantee their well -being.
  </p>
<p>
   Both for women of domestic work, and for all the women and men of the proletariat, the conquest of the general rise of wages, as a concrete struggle of the entire labor movement against the capitalists and their state, is essential, but it is the duty of the revolutionaries , organized in a revolutionary female movement, fight to raise the spirit of struggle and unity of workers and peasant women - which bourgeois feminism does not know -, so that other claims that especially interest women are welcomed by the entire labor movement.
  </p>
<p>
   It will have to be the women of the revolutionary female movement those that make the days of March 8, November 25 and especially of May 1 days of special demonstration of strength to make the most urgent and felt claims of women become in slogans that are heard and welcomed throughout the working class to advance in their conquest with the direct struggle and in the streets against:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    The superexploitation through long and intense working days and salary inequality
   </li>
<li>
    The unworthy working conditions to which the capitalists submit to women, including labor outsourcing
   </li>
<li>
    Impediments of any kind, regarding the training and education of women
   </li>
<li>
    Workplace and sexual harassment of women in the workplace
   </li>
<li>
    The lack of life, speculation and the crushing tax
   </li>
<li>
    Social lack of protection to children and adolescents by the State that in many cases leads to de -schooling, disease, child labor exploitation and even death by starvation
   </li>
<li>
    Unhealthy and unworthy housing conditions for women's heads
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   By:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    Equalization with men's wages: equal pay for equal work
   </li>
<li>
    Right to work under conditions of health, occupational health and direct and indefinite hiring as part of guaranteeing the economic independence of working women
   </li>
<li>
    Training for work so that women have facilities to conquer economic independence
   </li>
<li>
    Exemplary sanctions to companies that in silence support women harassment in their jobs
   </li>
<li>
    I immediate dismissal to the stalkers!
   </li>
<li>
    Mandatory economic subsidies for pregnant women and infants without employment
   </li>
<li>
    Adequate and balanced food for free for pregnant women and infants without employment and for childhood
   </li>
<li>
    Eradication of hunger and child prostitution
   </li>
<li>
    Guarantee of access to their own housing for mothers head of family and women mistreated by their husbands
   </li>
</ul>

  Anyone who follows the latest misadventures about Bolsonaro's involvement in the scammented acts, persecuted
  <em>
   looney tunes
  </em>
  by the clowns in togas of the Supreme Court, you can understand the fickle winds that govern the judiciary. Lula, when he was arrested, said, like any good opportunist, only
  <em>
   a part
  </em>
  Of the truth: the prison was political and justice is not fair. It is true, justice is not just, that even the blind see. When the faction of the big bourgeoisie alternates in command and it becomes interesting to have Lula back in the presidency, he is released. Now it is Bolsonaro who may enter the chess game. For the new-old owners of the ball, justice is fair again: the problem was not the State, only the minister. Sérgio Moro is out, Alexandre de Moraes is in. It's a good thing that when it's our turn the system works!
 </p>
<p>
  But if you want a better example, dodge the circus and think of Rafael Braga.
 </p>
<p>
  June 2013. A bottle of Pinho Sol and another of bleach. If you freak out a lot in the potato, you can, perhaps, with a lot of effort, make a Molotov cocktail with the same power as a stalle box. But Braga didn't do it. And I wouldn't. And was arrested, illegal possession of an incendiary weapon. Five years in Bangu 5. Nothing of padded cell or literary retreat. Postering for a photo of protest while arrested, went to lonely. Only due to the repercussion of the case, it obtained the penalty to be reversed to house arrest. A while later, he was thrown back in the cell to hit the prisoner quota for drug trafficking. No evidence, just “the word of the police” who broke him and threatened him with rape. Sentenced to eleven years for association with trafficking for carrying 0.6 grams of marijuana.
 </p>
<p>
  The translation
  <em>
   The false
  </em>
<em>
   guilty
  </em>
  did not fit well to
  <em>
   The Wrong Man,
  </em>
  Hitchcock movie. Manny is accused of robbing places he never was. Without the right to defend themselves, the police make evidence very subtly, without even realizing that they do so. They ask the witnesses to recognize him. The problem: Manny
  <em>
   looks
  </em>
  the robber. Therefore, the witnesses, when asked to say which of the men, arranged in line, assaulted them, do not hesitate to point to Manny. They make him parade in front of the stores robbed so that retailers "recognize" him, and they do so, naturally suggested. A handwriting test: “Do you find it similar?”, “A little.” That's enough.
 </p>
<p>
  The question is: what makes Manny the
  <em>
   wrong man
  </em>
  ? In the eyes of the judiciary, there is nothing wrong. Every crime presupposes a culprit to the system, who assumes the fault is whom the hood serves. If in Manny it fits, he is right. No matter the truth to justice, it serves to arrest, to contain the mass rebellion, to do “social cleaning”, to pretend a state efficiency to solve the problems he himself fosters.
 </p>
<p>
  Manny is only released because they think
  <em>
   The true culprit
  </em>
  . But and when there is no
  <em>
   one
  </em>
  True guilty? Who is to blame for drug trafficking? It is certainly not Rafael Braga, but it serves, just like the more than 200,000 prisoners under the same accusation. The law produces the culprit, so the Brazilian translation of Hitchcock is bad. There is no culprit when it is not a crime, but a project. Look at the militias, for the 37 pounds of cocaine on the FAB plane, for the landlord washing the money from Brazil's largest trafficker. The same politicians and military who finance drug trafficking today try to use Bolsonaro by scapegoat, saving all the rest of the holy and innocent armed forces.
 </p>
<p>
  Now let's complicate things a little. Pinho Sol was not the only thing criminalized in 2013. After glimpsing the strength of the masses, the state realized that it needed a better excuse to imprison them. A few years later, in 2016, when new waves of protests burst, anti -terrorism law was already in the oven. It was no more pantry, it was Olympics. Now, any protest - as Datena would say, "with a riot" - could be called terrorism, it was enough for the judges to make a tenth of the effort of Hitchcock police. After January 8, free pass protesters are detained on accusations of "undemocratic acts." Under the eyes of the law, they are equal to fascists in the barracks.
 </p>
<p>
  The Brazilian justice system is a factory of prisons. The fact that movie cops don't even realize that they fabricate evidence is the film's way of showing us that the problem is not the individuals, but the system. It's a good thing our police officers aren't so naïve, they told Braga that if he didn't confess, they would put a pistol in his pocket. In Brazil, the police know what they are for.
 </p>
<p>
  He didn't matter to Braga or Manny if no one could prove that they committed a crime, it mattered they couldn't defend themselves. The old joke: the burden is the accusation. That's what they invented pre -trial detention, guilty until the evidence is forged. And after 2013 the state had to invent a typification to facilitate the arrest of those who revolt. Brazilian justice always catches the wrong man. Whether they are Lula or Bolsonaro, they will only be imprisoned when they are no longer presidents, when they are not interesting to the real representatives. But the chair, she is still there. Who sits on her pays the dance. And there is no chair. That's why 2013 was so dangerous, the people had tired of chair dance, went out to break them.

   In April of last year, the Spanish government offered Maó to the Atlantic Alliance as “port with permanent diplomatic authorization” so that the allied ships that participate in the operation are Guardian (Guardian del Mar), and since then it is working, and since then it is working as such.

   , and that while their investments are not touched, it will let Spanish imperialism maneuver. The Spanish State has sold the Saharahui people to the Alawite reactionary monarchy. He uses it as a currency of Spanish imperialism to his faithful dog, Mohamed VI, so that the Moroccan State accepts Spanish immigration policy at the borders of Ceuta, Melilla and the Strait of Gibraltar. Other imperialist projects, such as "The Train of Mecca" also have the complicity of Yankee imperialism.

    As counterpart, Spain has accepted all the decisions of Yankee imperialism in NATO, in relation to the war of aggression of Russian imperialism in Ukraine, and in relation to transforming the Canary Islands into a Military Base of NATO and opening the possibility of more bases in the Spanish territory
