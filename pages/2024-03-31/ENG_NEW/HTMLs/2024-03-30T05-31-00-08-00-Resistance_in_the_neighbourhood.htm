   CONCENTRATION
  </b>
  AT ELEFTHERIAS PARK -
  <b>
   COURSE
  </b>
  To the US -Israel Embassies!
 </p>
 <p>
  The open war fronts in the world continue without finishing. From Ukraine to Palestine, the peoples of the peoples continues. Hundreds of thousands are dead and crushed. Hundreds of thousands are the ones who have been forced on the road to refugee, hunger and total misery.
  <b>
   And developments are even worse.
  </b>
  Young, huge dangers threaten the peoples of our region, but also of the whole planet, as the competitions between the imperialists, the great powers of the planet, are even more fierce.
 </p>
 <p>
  The unjust war on
  <b>
   Ukraine
  </b>
  , in the heart of Europe, not only does not show signs of expansion, but on the contrary it is even more complicated. Not only any of the imperialists who started and entangled in this war (USA - Russia - EU) is not in the mood to back down, but events such as the recent terrorist attack in Moscow, herald a new cycle of blood, intensity of the confrontation and possibly transportation her in new battlefields and competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   At the same time, in the headquarters of the imperialist forces, war rhetoric is upgraded to all levels, looking like preparation of a war -free war for the whole planet.
  </b>
  There is now an open debate about the possibility of a 3rd World War. Everyone's threats continue to use nuclear. The economies and production of EU countries are adapted to support a war orientation. And the peoples are prepared by their governments for the prospect of becoming meat for the cannons already set up. As in Germany, where the Minister of Education suggested schools prepare students for the possibility of war !!! And all this has long been a science fiction scenarios, but images of the present and - mainly - of the future that the imperialists are preparing for peoples.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   The horrible picture of the present is the slaughter of the heroic Palestinian people by the state-tromocrat who continues without stopping!
  </b>
  Tens of thousands are dead throughout the Gaza Strip of the ruthless Israeli pounding over the last five months, while hunger and thirst are reaping those who manage to survive. The blows have long been expanded to the West Bank, while new daily targets are food warehouses, food distribution points, hospitals and refugee camps. The forthcoming invasion of Rafa foreshadows a new expansion of the massacre, with the aim of completely expanding the Palestinians from their place and at the same time accumulates terms and dangers of a more comprehensive ignition in the Middle East region.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Our country is increasingly involved in the war games of the region.
  </b>
  The New Democracy government, as a representative of the dependent local ruling class, offers "land and water" to its imperialist masters and to promote their blood-soaked plans in the region. The dispatch of the frigate "Hydra" to the Red Sea, the conversion of Larissa into a command post for military operations, the use of the entire country as a base for murderers, both towards Ukraine and the Middle East, prove the deepening of the country's involvement in the war fronts and at the same time pose the people of our country in front of enormous dangers.
  <b>
   They are preparing our people and the peoples of the area, to become meat for the canons of war and imperialist competitions. Only the peoples can block their plans!
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Against this climate of war our people must give their own militant response:
  <b>
   To form a wide, mass anti-war-anti-imperialist movement against the policy of barbarism.
  </b>
  In the same way that students and peasants rose up. In the same way that people and youth rose up against crime in Tempe.
  <b>
   In the same way that is massively expressed all over the world
  </b>
  Solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and who must continue more massively and more decisively in our country.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   The black anniversary for the 75th anniversary of the founding of NATO, the largest war machine on the planet, to be the occasion of massive demonstrations of solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people and against war and imperialism!
  </b>
