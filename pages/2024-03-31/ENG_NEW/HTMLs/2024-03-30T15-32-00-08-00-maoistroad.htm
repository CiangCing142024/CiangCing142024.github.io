   Rheinmetall
 operates a South African subsidiary – Rheinmetall Denel Munitions. 
While the multinational parent company Rheinmetall is developing a 155mm
 howitzer with Elbit Systems (NB customers for this include the German 
and potentially the UK and Hungarian governments), Rheinmetall Denel 
specialises in 155mm artillery ammunition. It is not yet clear whether 
this ammunition will be used in the co-produced howitzer.

  ASDAM
 is Australia’s largest supplier to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 
Program. An Australian advanced manufacturing and sustainment company, 
it provides end-to-end capability across design, engineering, 
manufacturing, assembly and sustainment. The group includes four 
subsidiaries: Marand, TAE Aerospace, Levett Engineering and Rosebank 
Engineering. (See their profiles following below.)
 </p>
 <p>
  ASDAM’s role 
is to provide continued access to capital and resources to build and 
grow Australian sovereign industrial capability. It is majority-owned by
 funds managed by CPE Capital.
 </p>
 <p>
  ASDAM’s members service a number of
 defence and non-defence programs, and have long term relationships with
 governments, defence prime contractors and other industrial customers. 
Customers include Lockheed Martin, BAE Systems, Honeywell, Pratt &amp; 
Whitney and BHP.

  One
 of the most successful Australian companies in the F-35 supply chain, 
receiving about one third of the Australian contracts in the program. 
Marand designed and manufactures the F-35’s engine removal and 
installation trailer and is recognised globally as its Original 
Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).
 </p>
 <p>
  The company also has a long-term 
agreement with BAE Systems for the manufacture of the aircraft’s 
vertical tails, one of the largest planned manufacturing projects for 
the F-35 in Australia (

 </p>
 <p>
  In
 2016 Marand also won the detailed design and manufacture contract for 
the Engine/Lift Fan Removal and Installation Trainer (ELFRIT), and the 
company also supplies tooling to BAE Systems in the UK and four other 
F-35 partner nations.

  Broens
 had been one of the first Australian companies involved in the F-35 
program, starting in 2004. It undertook a limited amount of work 
directly for Lockheed Martin, but most of its JSF work was through BAE 
Systems plc, including the manufacture of fixtures and composite tooling
 for the vertical tail. Broens also won an international multi-million 
dollar tender by Pratt &amp; Whitney to design and manufacture the 
engine gearbox lift. In 2012, Broens was reported as manufacturing 
multiple units of the lift. It was expected that ultimately every JSF 
squadron globally would have one or more; an estimated global total of 
150 lifts. (Sources:

  NO
 LONGER EXISTS IN AUSTRALIA employed a full range of capabilities in 
airframe structural analysis and design, electrical engineering and 
systems installation design and was central to the success of Australian
 industry involvement in the F-35 program.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2002, GKN AES 
decided to actively pursue work on the F-35 and was the first company to
 receive a contract in the program. In November 2003, it was awarded a 
contract by Northrop Grumman for 18 staff (nine based in the US) to 
support the design, analysis and manufacture of F-35 centre fuselage 
parts for 15 months. The contract expanded over the next three years 
peaking during 2006 with over 220 GKN AES designers and engineers being 
part of the F-35 program, of which more than 90 per cent were based in 
Australia.
 </p>
 <p>
  The company worked for both Lockheed Martin and 
Northrop Grumman on all three variants of the F-35. It accumulated one 
million engineering hours designing some 3,000 distinct parts for the 
F-35 which amounted to 12 per cent of the airframe by part number.
 </p>
 <p>
  In
 2009, GKN’s engineering services activities were sold to an Indian 
engineering firm which decided to close the Australian operation. Even 
so, there remain a large number of Australian aerospace engineers with 
significantly enhanced experience spread throughout Australian industry 
and the aerospace industry globally. (
