   Latehar District, March 30, 2024:
  </strong>
  A sub-zonal commander of the CPI (Maoist) was arrested in Jharkhand’s Latehar district, a police official announced to the press today.
 </p>
 <p class="_yeti_done">
  The Maoist was identified as Nageshwar Bhokta alias Nageshwar Ganjhu, a sub-zonal commander of the Maoist party, a senior official declared.
 </p>
 <p class="_yeti_done">
  Latehar Superintendent of Police Anjani Anjan stated that Bhokta was arrested from Mirchaiya forest in the Garu Police Station area on Friday.
 </p>
 <p>
  “We got a tip-off about the presence of CPI (Maoist) regional committee member Chhotu Kharwar in Lohargarha and Mirchaiya forest with his squad to carry out some operations aimed at causing harm to the security forces during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Accordingly, a team was sent to the forest,” the SP said.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a squad of cadres belonging to the Maoist party saw the police personnel, they started running away but the sub-zonal commander could not escape from there and he was caught, the police official remarked.
