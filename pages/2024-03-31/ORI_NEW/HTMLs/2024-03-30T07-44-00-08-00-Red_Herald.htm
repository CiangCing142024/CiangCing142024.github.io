  We have previously
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/14/clashes-in-senegal-after-president-postpones-elections/">
   reported
  </a>
  on clashes in Senegal after the parliament on the 5
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February decided to postpone the presidential elections originally scheduled for the 25
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February. In the clashes the “security forces” murdered three protesters, including a 16-year-old who was shot in the head.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the 6
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March the postponement of the election was overruled, and it was decided that the election had to take place before the 2
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of April, the end of the term of the current President of Senegal, Macky Sall. Sall accepted the decision and announced that the election would be held on the 24
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cnx753jej07t/senegal">
   election resulted
  </a>
  in favor of Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who received 54.28% of the votes. Sall has already conceded and congratulated Faye.
 </p>
 <p>
  Imperialist institutions, such as the The Royal Institute of International Affairs of British imperialism, has
  <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/03/democracy-west-africa-why-senegals-election-crisis-matters">
   hailed the election
  </a>
  as a “critical victory” for Senegalese democracy and a “national turning point”, as well as important for the stability in West Africa. However, only 61% of those registered to vote participated in the election. This is down from the
  <a href="https://conseilconstitutionnel.sn/decision-n-4-e-2019-affaire-n-25-e-19/">
   voter turnout of 66%
  </a>
  in the last presidential election in Senegal in 2019. There were also several candidates who were not allowed to run, including Ousmane Sonko, who got more than 15% present of the votes in the 2019 election, and Karim Wade, who got more than 34% of the votes in the 2012 election.
