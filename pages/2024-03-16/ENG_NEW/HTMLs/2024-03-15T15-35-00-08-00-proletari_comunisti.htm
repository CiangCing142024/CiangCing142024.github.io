  FOR OVER A WEEK ADRIFT AT SEA WITHOUT ANY RESCUE
 </b>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  From Radio Onda d'Affe
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ocean Viking ship by Sos Mediterranee rescued on Wednesday 13 March, in international waters in the central Mediterranean, 25 people drift to a dinghy. They say they started in 75 from Libya. According to the first testimonies,
  <b>
   The boat spent at least 7 days in the open sea without receiving any rescue.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Survivors say that many people are
  <b>
   death of hunger, thirst and burns,
  </b>
  due to the prolonged time in the middle of the sea. If the numbers are confirmed, they are dramatic: there is talk of over 50 deaths of the 75 migrants left from Libya a week ago. "We sighted them by chance, with a binoculars, two miles from our ship," says Francesco Creazzo of Sos Mediterranee Italy. "Two people were unconscious, the few survivors who managed to speak said they started in 75".

  On the deadliest migration route in the world, the rescue system is insufficient, denounces SOS Mediterranee: with the tightening of the "discriminatory policy of detention against rescue ships", most recently wanted by the
  <b>
   Decree planted, "3 humanitarian ships are currently blocked by the Italian authorities, preventing them from saving lives in the Mediterranean".
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  The criminalization of rescue at sea and the criminalization of NGOs is aimed at "using the Mediterranean and
  <b>
   The death that is produced in the Mediterranean as a deterrent to departures
  </b>
  ", says Francesco Creazzo who adds that the Piantedosi decree, after the decrees of previous governments, is "the last of the methods to empty the Mediterranean from the annoying eyes of civil society that are ships like the Ocean Viking".
