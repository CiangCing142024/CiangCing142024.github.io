        The reasons of the judges
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As they explain in a note “Exingration Rebellion he had immediately done 
 appeal to contest the illegitimacy of the provision. An ordinance 
 of the Administrative Court of Turin has now ordered “La 
 suspension of the effectiveness ”of the sheets of via, the first step towards 
 the cancellation, which will however be discussed in almost a year, in January 
 2025. The reasons of the judges underline “procedural anomalies, which 
  they would not correspond to any typical act of judicial police or a 
  a correct establishment of a contradictory ".
      </p>
      <p>
       The via sheet, reintroduced in the Italian system pursuant to 
 of law 159/2011 for the fight against organized crime, is 
 provided for those who are "usually dedicated to criminal trafficking" 
  or that "their behavior must be considered, on the basis of 
 Elements of fact a danger to safety ". It is a 
 provision given by the commissioner, with very large discretion, which he has 
 Immediate and upsetting effects on the legal and personal sphere. 
 For these reasons, careful investigation would be foreseen on 
 elements that justify its adoption. Investigation which, according to the 
 Turin judges, in this case it would have been missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The order also focuses on the merits of the provision. THE 
 Giudici underline how “the danger is feared in terms 
 completely abstract "and as" the democratic - constitutional system 
 tolerates purely demonstrative manifestations, to be ascribed to the 
 manifestation of thought where they did not lead to the risk of 
 damage to people or things ". In short, these are not dangerous criminals, 
  but simple citizens who, although in a very showy way, exercise 
  one's right to demonstrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       A right that, in the case of climatic activists, is more and more 
 Often questioned, also in the Democratic Europe. The report 
  of the UN, published at the end of February, asks European countries to place 
 aim for the repression and criminalization of peaceful protests 
 of environmentalists, defining the policies implemented so far against 
 Climate activists a threat to democracy and human rights ".

       “In recent weeks he has been very debated on the right to 
 event. Pisa Manganellate have been read by several parties 
 as a way to intimidate and dissuade from going to the square - 
 He declares Exingration Rebellion - but that's only the tip of the iceberg. THE 
  identifying hours of hours, fines, pretentious complaints, sheets 
 in via ... they are all practical that the police regularly uses for 
 scare, to isolate, to criminalize whoever manifests. And that bring 
  A long time and money. To defend us from the complaints and sheets of 
 Via of the last few months we have already spent 20 thousand euros. For accusations that 
 They fall and street sheets that are declared illegitimate ".

       “Making dissent is the salt of democracy. This is the judges 
 they seem to have it clear, a little less the Ministry of the Interior and the 
 Defence".
