  INTRODUCTION
 </h2>
 <p>
  Every year, the US is launched and launched by the Wargames on earth, sovereignty territories and immediate surrounding the Philippines. At the same time the construction of multiple military bases, outposts and facilities that serve as the base of troops and storage of equipment, weapons, warships and other arsenal (chemical, biological and nuclear) that it uses in the battlefield and the war and “Preparing a war theater” against China. Each time, thousands of American troops were stopped in the Philippines on the veil of sailing, port visits, conducting “combined” activities and uninterrupted Wargames.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US has further restricted its operational control of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), by controlling its arsenal. It is piling up bombs, weapons and obsolete military equipment in the name of "modernization" of the reactionary army. Using these weapons, the US is aggressively interfering in the AFP's anti-insurgency campaign and the Marcos regime against the liberating Filipino movement that remains the most stable and greatest obstacle to its imperialist ambitions in the Asian region. As a result, the AFP is increasingly dependent on US financial and military assistance, which makes them easily accessible to the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US's life is a threat to the lives of Filipinos and the freedom of the country's current use of the AFP and Marcos's puppet regime as a person in front of his armed armed or war in China. The communist Party of the Philippines and the national-democratic movement must strictly lead the entire Filipino people to defend the country's rights against foreign military interference, promote the intent for peace, assert peace policy, and to defeat the outbreak of inter-imperialist war and dragging here in the Philippines.
 </p>
 <h2>
  1) What is the significance of Balikatan and other Wargames this 2024?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The US and the AFP have announced that the "largest" of its history will be the 39th Balikatan this coming April and May. It will focus on the "key locations" in the western part of Palawan, a place where the presence of Chinese ships is thick. It is also the target location of the island of Mavulis, the most increasing island in the Batanes province of Bashi Channel. It is only 200 nautical miles (approximately 370 kilometers) away from Taiwan's Orchid Island.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last year, more than 17,000 troops conducted combat drills in the country (among Batanes) of which 12,000 Americans, 5,000 Filipinos and 100 were Australian. For the first time, France, a US key in Europe, will participate in Wargames.
 </p>
 <p>
  Balikatan 2024 is just one of the more than 500 Wargames and other military activities planned by the US in the Philippines this year. This does not include the unilateral and more covering Wargames conducted by the US, alone or with its other Asian allies, inside or near the Philippine ocean territory without the AFP's participation.
 </p>
 <p>
  Among them were "large deck exercises" conducted by the US in the Philippine Sea in eastern Taiwan, using two of its warships and being trampled by similar Japanese ships. These large ships, also called "floating military bases," lie indefinitely and without permission in Philippine maritime territories on the basis of extraterritorial rights granted by the puppet Philippine state to the US.
 </p>

  Aligaga the Batanes in the presence of Americans
 </h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Rice was depleted on the island of Batan, Batanes in April 2023 when residents were panic buying after it was heard that American troops were going to the island for the Wargames of Balikatan. They know that the Wargames are preparing for possible communication with Taiwan, even though the AFP and the US have denied it. "We do not want to be in trouble," the island of the island said at that time.
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  The conflict spread to the smallest province in the Philippines when the US used it in Balikatan as a troop playground. The small island was raided by thousands of troops, hundreds of ships and aircraft, cannons and other weapons. It was the simulated beach landings of amphibious US warships on the coast, landing large and over-noisy Osprey on hills, and firing of high-mobility artillery rocket systems.
 </p>
 <h2>
  2) What is the "Strategic Island Defense" of the AFP?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The US, AFP and Marcos' officials have been joining the AFP's "turning" from the "internal defense" to the "external defense" because the New People's army is "weak" or "overwhelmed". At the beginning of the year, Gilbert Teodoro, Secretary of the Department of National Defense, announced the formation of the AFP's Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC). This defense plan is allegedly for protection of the Philippine exclusive economic zone in Palawan (where the presence of American and Chinese ships), and in Batanes (which are planned to be the US headquarters because of its approach to Taiwan).
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, the CADC is associated with the US "Archipelagic Defense Strategy" that has pushed for the laying of the system of missile and cannon in its so-called "first-island chain." This strategy is promoted as a way to prevent the expansion of the "threat" of China's military power. Behind this strategy is giving the US mainland a "deep defense" when the war broke out between it and China. This means that the countries in the "first-island chain" are the main tom of a US-china war, in the event of a flare.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part of this strategy is the US strengthening the presence of troops and positioning weapons at its military bases in Japan and South Korea. It is a major part of the US's north and western Philippines as military bases and facilities that will serve as a lover of the mysterious attack that will fall inside the mainland of China.

   General view of the archipelagic defense strategy
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-52820" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240315.Mapa-Overview-ng-Archipelagic-Defense.png" srcset="https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240315.Mapa-Overview-ng-Archipelagic-Defense.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to its name, the "Archipelagic Defense Strategy" is an open plan. The aggressive and more comprehensive Indo-Pacific security strategy advises it. At the same time the US strengthens its military alliance in Asia, such as Aukus (Australia-united Kingdom-United States) and Quad (US, UK, India and Japan).
 </p>
 <h2>
  3) How many US military bases and facilities are under EDCA?
 </h2>
 <p>
  Throughout 2023, the renovation of the old and construction of new US bases and facilities, using the town's fund, the people's resources and the labor force of this AFP puppet. Gilbert Teodoro, Secretary of the Department of Defense, himself turned the country to ensure an end to 95 projects (from 32) of the nine designated "agreed location" under the EDCA.
 </p>
 <p>
  Those who have completed the jetfuel storage and construction of the "Command Center" of American soldiers at Lal-lo airpot in Cagayan (a civilian airport); Breaking the airport and construction of the warehouse and plane garaplane (Hangar) at the wet airbase in Pampanga; Jetfuel in Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu; and large buildings and barracks in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija. The harbor, airport, airport and construction of the military camp construction on Balabac Island in Palawan and other "EDCA sites" has begun for the US exclusive use.

   EDCA Sites

 <p>
  <img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-46012" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230821.EDCA-sites.png" srcset="https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230821.EDCA-sites.png"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  In September 2023, the US announced its desire to increase the nine existing bases. But before that, the masses affected had reported the deployment of American troops and the existence of their facilities in Ilocos Norte and parts of Ilocos Sur and Oriental Mindoro. US naval forces are also using the former Subic Naval Base in Zambales that was bought by an American arms company from Hanjin Industries, after it closed in 2019. The US has also been accused of piling up military equipment on a 25-hectare "AFP camp" in the Calayan Islands in Cagayan and its construction of two "civilian ports" on Batan Island in Batanes after using the island in Balikatan in 2023. In March, a senator revealed that in fact, there are 16 and not just nine EDCA sites being developed for the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except for the permanent US troops that are not subject to the EDCA Agreement, such as Zamboanga and Basilan under the Operation Pacific Eagle-Philippines, as well as various communication facilities (Samar, Cebu, Mindoro, Boracay, Pangasinan, and There are many places) that the AFP and the US do not admit.
 </p>
 <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">
  U.S. soldiers in Ilocos Norte
 </h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  When the US launched military drills in San Joaquin, Sarrat, Ilocos Norte in March 2023, it involved several civilians in the village. "(In Treyning), we are the ones who come from American soldiers who are supposed to be war casualties," said a resident of the training. “That means' when it is a real war that we are the one to take care of the American soldiers to be disappointed. They are still going to lose it! ”
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  Although there is no "agreed location" in Ilocos Norte, US military infrastructure and facilities exist here. The US claimed 30 hectares of land in Barangay Bobon, Burgos, where 40 cancestors were located. American soldiers also built buildings that they are still proud of for monitoring or monitoring China's military movement. The US also builds a seawall of the road as a portification of their base, which is a hindrance to the descent and rise of fishermen to the sea.
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  With a 7-day simulation and live fire exercises in the area, small fishermen were not fishing. "We have a hard time here," said one fisherman. "What if we were in the mood and then their rockets suddenly fired?"
 </p>
 <h2>
  4) What other agreements does the US use to maintain its presence in the country?
 </h2>
 <p>
  On May 1, 2023, Ferdinand Marcos Jr and Joseph Biden, US president, signed the Bilateral Defense Guidelines, a document re-enacting the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), a colonial treaty that tied the Philippines to US foreign policy. In a US-prepared "guide," it set out funding, training and arming the AFP to serve the puppet army in its anti-China objectives. In April 2023, the Philippines signed a 5-10-year security plan for the "modernization" of AFP weapons, camps and facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since the MDT, it has served as a basis for the US invasion of the internal national issues and dragging the Philippines into the wars that the US has entered in the past seven decades.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 1947, the US pushed for the Military Bases Agreement (MBA) and used 65,000 hectares of agricultural land and ancestral land to serve as a base for American soldiers, and storage of its weapons, including nuclear weapons. These bases have been turned into a starting point for US aggression forces in these wars.
 </p>
 <p>
  The MDT served as a destination for other military agreements, especially after the Philippine Senate dismissed the MBA in 1992. Among them are:
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  <strong>
   Visiting Forces Agreement:
  </strong>
  1998, signed by the Ramos regime. Allowed free discharge and stay of large numbers of American troops, and gave them extrateritorial rights.
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  In 2006, the US developed the Security Engagement Board (SEB), based on the VFA, to set AFP's "community" activities and easier to manage large Wargames such as Balikatan. Also through Seb, it is determined what the Philippine weapons "buy" in the US, under the US Foreign Military Funding program.
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  <strong>
   Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement:
  </strong>
  2014, signed by the Aquino II regime. It allowed the construction of exclusive US military facilities and bases within AFP military camps to use them as a dump of US military equipment, or the rest of American troops in the country.
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  This is now the basis for building military bases wherever the US wants in the country.
 </p>
 <h2>
  5) Is the AFP really saying that it will focus on the "external defense" and that it will leave counterinsurgency?
 </h2>
 <p>
  To date, there is no indication that the AFP plans to focus its attention on the external defense, despite the DND secretary's statements. To this day, a majority of its battalions have focused on the NPA guerrilla fields despite its "insurgency-free" grace that many, all, of the provinces and has declared the "stable internal peace and security" situation in the many parts of the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, General Romeo Brawner Jr, Commander of the AFP, re -issued a dedicated Dedlayn on March to crush all guerrilla fields by March 31, all NPA vertical formations on June 30, and all NPA units at the end of the year. This assignment was accompanied by the bombing and bombings from the air and there was no bombing in Abra, Negros, Bukidnon, Iloilo and Quezon. There is also no violation of its units in the laws of modern warfare, and human rights of millions of civilians.
 </p>
 <p>
  From 2021, the US has poured $ 2.1 billion worth of weapons provided or sold in the Philippines including jet fighters, missile, bombs, howssers, and other weapons. In the US compass, the AFP intensified the anti-revolutionary war that was allegedly used by the use of state terrorism. In conjunction with the starting operation of the Pacific Eagle-Philippines, the Trump government pushed Duterte in October 2017 the declaration of terrorist and the NPA and the end of the peace talks. With the US and its agents at the AFP and the security sector, the more vicious "anti-terrorism law" was enacted in 2020.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since then the brutal anti-Gemilian tactics also used by the US in Vietnam including bombings, extrajudicial killings, and bombings from the air have been implemented. The widespread cases of AFP and PNP violations of human rights and blasphemies of international humanitarian laws are pushing some progressive US legislators to insist that the US stop providing military assistance to the Philippines.
 </p>
 <h2>
  6) What are the roots of the US and China's military rivalry?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The roots of the US and China, which began to intensify in the mid-2000s, were economical. Since the end of the 1970s, the US has supported China's continuous transformation from socialist to being capitalist, including monopoly bureaucrat capitalists in China. The US has sparked China with trade and investment (“most favored nation”). It allows China to develop its own industry in conjunction with the growing part of production, especially in the field of technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  The monopoly-capitalists of the state in China benefit the offensive of neoliberalism or liberalization, deregulation, and privatization in China and around the world. China quickly transformed into a newly emerged imperialist power. The monopoly-capitalists in China have exported capital in the form of loans and investments. Russia, it has established its own economic bloc (BRICS) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
 </p>
 <p>
  China has repeatedly strengthened its military forces and its overseas operations. These include the construction of military bases on seven artificial islands in the South China Sea and within the Philippine maritime territory, to control the trade route here.
 </p>
 <p>
  The construction of these military bases is an explicit military aggression and is against the Philippine naval rights recognized by the International Arbitral Tribunal's decision under the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Seas (UNCLOS). During the economic era, the US renewed this China's strengthening.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the financial crisis in 2008, the US complained of its trade in China, China's control over a major part of the global trade. The US has pushed for the formation of trade blocks that settled in China, in conjunction with the implementation of protective policies. In 2011, the US government declared the "Pivot to Asia" to rotate the focus of its military forces from Europe and the Middle East to Asia.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the Trump government to the Biden government, the US imposed on the pressure on the Chinese economy, allegedly to punish it for not complying with the "global principles." The US also imposed pressure on importing agricultural products from China.
 </p>
 <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">
  It looks like a war in the Mindoro Ocean
 </h3>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  The Occidental Mindoro ocean was a war-war when the US launched a "Maritime Cooperative Activity" in January on Cabral Island, covered by the West Philippine Sea. As the American soldiers showed up, along with their Filipino soldiers, two Chinese warships were watching them in the distance.
 </p>
 <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
  The MCA aims to prepare the US on ships and army of the Philippines to bring them into a war against China. Three such activities have been held by the US from December 2023 to February this year.
 </p>
 <h2>
  7) What is the party's stance on Taiwan's issue?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The PKP supports Taiwan citizens in the militant resistance to US use in Taiwan as a piece of geopular strategy. It criticizes the US interference in China's internal affairs, as well as China's militarist response. It supports the goal of the proletariat and the people both of China and Taiwan for peaceful and gentle resolution of their reunion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CPP, and the proletariat and the Filipino people, together with the whole world, stand against the US's waging of war in Asia and against its use in the Philippines as a launching pad for aggression in Taiwan and against China.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US has long been using Taiwan as a piece of hegemonism in its Asia and economic and military struggle with China. For the past 75 years, it has used Taiwan as economic and military land to advance its strategic geopolitical interest in the Asia-Pacific region. The US considers the Taiwan part of the "first-island chain" strategy to prevent China's rise and strengthening as imperialist rivals. It is actively funding and pushing groups to Taiwan to assert the "independence" to undermine China's handle. It continues to pour funds to raise Taiwan's military strength.
 </p>
 <h2>
  8) Will the imperialist war between the US and China be about to break?
 </h2>
 <p>
  With the US taking over China, the possibility of a war is growing. It is a manifestation of the intensification of the inter-imperialist fringe amid the widespread crisis of the global capitalist system.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US forces to maintain itself as the primary and unique power worldwide. It is an attempt to change the world's developing division and seize the markets and sources of raw materials in control of its rivals of imperialist power. The US is urging China in conjunction with its continuous war in Ukraine against Russia.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US-burning wars are greatly benefited from the largest US military companies that have garnered billions of dollar pipes. In Ukraine, the US has dumped a large portion of its military equipment, while pushing other imperialist allies to provide advanced weapons. The US has also dumped in military equipment in the Philippines.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, any US attempt to invade China's armed forces will be futile and fail, as many times have proven that American troops have entered Mainland Asia (Vietnam, Korea, China). US military experts are aware of this, so its hard work of the military scenario is to push China to "invade" Taiwan to justify "defending Taiwan." All of this aims to push China to take the initiative and force the word of Lt. Gen. James Bierman of the Third Marine Expeditionary Force to "first shoot" ("Own The Starting Gun". Bierman compared the US to the US military presence in Japan and the Philippines for several years of US war in Ukraine against Russia.
 </p>
 <h2>
  9) Why is the US war in Asian warfare and freedom of Filipino life and freedom?
 </h2>
 <p>
  The US left-wing war of war, in particular the military confrontation in China on Taiwan's issue, as well as pushing for strengthening the operations of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea, is It provides a major threat to the lives of Filipinos and the country's freedom, as well as the life and freedom of various countries in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  The construction of US military bases as part of the US "Theater" theater "preparation of the US war against China is a direct defense of the Philippines' right to self-determination. The US's use of the AFP as a support for force in aggressive aggression is increasingly trampling on the country's independence.
 </p>
 <p>
  It explicitly denies the right of Filipinos to have independent foreign policy. It seizes the Filipinos the right to decide whether the participation in the US -pushed war is in accordance with the national interests and desires of the Filipinos.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US has involved the Philippines in its aggressive military policy. The possibility that the US uses its facilities in the Philippines to fly missiles, launch jetfighters, or service its warships, is not a long-distance reason for the country to target the country of Chinese invasion.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Marcos regime's submission to US orders and betrayal of Philippine independence have led the country to wars that have nothing to do with its national interests. In exchange for military and political support, the Marcos regime blindly follows the US military's wishes and needs for the construction of bases and facilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, such as the Duterte regime, the Marcos regime has no spine in the face of China's outright blasphemy in Philippine maritime territory in building military bases, and China's seizure of the Philippine Ocean. China's oppression of the Philippines, especially Filipino fishermen, is now being used by the US publicity to justify and capture the sympathy of Filipinos in its strengthening military presence in the South China Sea.

At the same time the construction of multiple military bases, outposts and facilities that serve as the base of troops and storage of equipment, weapons, warships and other arsenal (chemical, biological and nuclear) that it uses in the battlefield and the war and “Preparing a war theater” against China. Each time, thousands of American troops were stopped in the Philippines on the veil of sailing, port visits, conducting “combined” activities and uninterrupted Wargames. The US further restricts its control over the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), by controlling its arsenal. Increased bombs, weapons and old-fashioned military equipment on behalf of the "modernization" of the reactionary army. With these weapons, the US aggressively aggressively intervening in the AFP's anti-insurgency campaign and the Marcos regime against the liberating Philippine movement that remains the most stable and biggest obstacle to its imperialist ambitions in the Asian region. As a result, the AFP is increasingly hoping for the US financial and military assistance, which is why they are easily followed by the US. The US's life is a threat to the lives of Filipinos and the freedom of the country's current use of the AFP and Marcos's puppet regime as the staff in front of its armed armed conflict or war in China. The communist Party of the Philippines and the national-democratic movement must strictly lead the entire Filipino people to defend the country's rights against foreign military interference, promote the intent for peace, assert peace policy, and to defeat the outbreak of inter-imperialist war and dragging here in the Philippines. <br><br> 1 | US the imperialist war in China, the threat of life and freedom of Filipinos1) What is the significance of Balikatan and other Wargames this 2024? The US and the AFP have announced that the "largest" of its history will be the 39th Balikatan this coming April and May. It will focus on the "key locations" in the western part of Palawan, a place where the presence of Chinese ships is thick. It is also the target location of the island of Mavulis, the most increasing island in the Batanes province of Bashi Channel. It is only 200 nautical miles (approximately 370 kilometers) away from Taiwan's Orchid Island. Last year, more than 17,000 troops conducted combat drills in the country (among Batanes) of which 12,000 Americans, 5,000 Filipinos and 100 were Australian. For the first time, France, a US key in Europe, will participate in Wargames. Balikatan 2024 is just one of the more than 500 Wargames and other military activities planned by the US in the Philippines this year. This does not include the unilateral and more covering Wargames conducted by the US, alone or with its other Asian allies, inside or near the Philippine ocean territory without the AFP's participation. Among them were the "large deck exercises" conducted by the US in the Philippine Sea in the eastern part of Taiwan, using its two warships and landed by a similar Japanese ship. This large ships, also called "floating military bases" remain uninhabited and permission to the Philippine Sea territory on the validity of extrateritorial rights awarded by the Filipino State Puppet in the US. <br><br> 2 | US imperialist war in China, life -threatening and freedom of Philippine US military bases in Asia with 7,000 personnel and 90 aircraft: Carl Vinson Aircraft Carrier in Pacific in July 2021 (US Navy) USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), leading ship of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, on August 11, 2022 after its landing on Indopacific (US Navy) USS Ronald Reagan (CVN76) while traveling to Balabac Strait and to South China Sea in July in July 12, 2022 (US Navy) <br><br> 3 | US imperialist war in China, threat to life and freedom of Filipinos Batanes in the presence of the Americans and the rice wasted on the island of Batan, Batanes in April 2023 when residents panicked after hearing the island was raised on the island American troops for Wargames of Balikatan. They know that the Wargames are preparing for possible communication with Taiwan, even though the AFP and the US have denied it. “We do not want to be in trouble,” the It was a century on the island at that time. The anxiety was widespread in the smallest provinces in the Philippines when the US used it in Balikatan as a troop player. The small island of thousands of troops, hundreds of maritime and aircraft, cannon and other weapons were raided. The simulated "beach landing" is conducted by the amphibious US warships on the coast, landing and excessive noisy osprey on the hills, and firing the burial himars (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) . <br><br> 4 | US by the US imperialist war in China, the threat of life and freedom of the Filipinos2) What is the AFP's "Strategic Island Defense"? The US, AFP and Marcos' officials have been joining the AFP's "turning" from the "internal defense" to the "external defense" because the New People's army is "weak" or "overwhelmed". At the beginning of the year, Gilbert Teodoro, Secretary of the Department of National Defense, announced the formation of the AFP's Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept (CADC). This defense plan is allegedly for protection of the Philippine exclusive economic zone in Palawan (where the presence of American and Chinese ships), and in Batanes (which are planned to be the US headquarters because of its approach to Taiwan). In fact, the CADC is associated with the US "Archipelagic Defense Strategy" that has pushed for the laying of the system of missile and cannon in its so-called "first-island chain." This strategy is promoted as a way to prevent the expansion of the "threat" of China's military power. Behind this strategy is giving the US mainland a "deep defense" when the war broke out between it and China. This means that the countries in the "first-island chain" are the main tom of a US-china war, in the event of a flare. Part of this strategy is the US strengthening the presence of troops and positioning weapons at its military bases in Japan and South Korea. It is a major part of the US's north and western Philippines as military bases and facilities that will serve as a lover of the mysterious attack that will fall inside the mainland of China. (See map: General Viewing…) Contrary to its name, the “Archipelagic Defense Strategy” is an open plan. The aggressive and more comprehensive Indo-Pacific security strategy advises it. At the same time the US strengthens its military alliance in Asia, such as Aukus (Australia-united Kingdom-United States) and Quad (US, UK, India and Japan). <br><br> 5 | US imperialist warfare in China, life -threatening and freedom of Filipinos in the Overview of Archipelagic Defense strategy Source: Archipelagic Defense 2.0, Hudson Institute, 2023 <br><br>  6 | The US of the imperialist war in China, threats to Filipino life and freedom3) Throughout 2023, the renovation of the old and construction of new US bases and facilities, using the town's fund, the people's resources and the labor force of this AFP puppet. Gilbert Teodoro, Secretary of the Department of Defense, himself turned the country to ensure an end to 95 projects (from 32) of the nine designated "agreed location" under the EDCA. Those who have completed the jetfuel storage and construction of the "Command Center" of American soldiers at Lal-lo airpot in Cagayan (a civilian airport); Breaking the airport and construction of the warehouse and plane garaplane (Hangar) at the wet airbase in Pampanga; Jetfuel in Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu; and large buildings and barracks in Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija. The harbor, airport, airport and construction of the military camp construction on Balabac Island in Palawan and other "EDCA sites" has begun for the US exclusive use. (See map “Edca Sites.”) In September 2023, the US announced its desire to increase nine existing bases. But before that, the affected people have reported the stay of American troops and the existence of their facilities in Ilocos Norte and parts of Ilocos Sur and Oriental Mindoro. US Naval Forces also use the former Subic Naval Base in Zambales purchased by an American weapon company from Hanjin Industries, after it closed in 2019. The US has also been reported in the 25-hectare “ AFP camp ”at the Calayan Islands in Cagayan and its construction of two“ civilian ports ”on Batan Island in Batanes after using the island in Balikatan in 2023. In March, a senator revealed that in the Actually, 16, and not only nine are developed by the "EDCA site" for the US. <br><br> 7 | USS OF THE US OF THE EMPROVATION OF THE CHINA, THE LIFE AND FREEDOM OF THE PHILIPPINES <br><br>  8 | US imperialist war in China, the life and freedom of the Filipinos here are permanent US troops who are not subject to the EDCA Agreement, such as Zamboanga and Basilan under the Pacific Eagle-Philippine Operation Eagle-Philippine operation, as well as various Other communication facilities (Samar, Cebu, Mindoro, Boracay, Pangasinan, and many other places) that the AFP and the US do not admit. American soldiers in Ilocos Norte were arrested when the US launched military drills in San Joaquin, Sarrat, Ilocos Norte in March 2023, involved some civilians in the village. "(In Treyning), we are the ones who come from American soldiers who are supposed to be war casualties," said a resident of the training. “That means' when it is a real war that we are the one to take care of the American soldiers to be disappointed. They are still going to lose it! ” Although there is no "agreed location" in Ilocos Norte, US military infrastructure and facilities exist here. The US claimed 30 hectares of land in Barangay Bobon, Burgos, where 40 cancestors were located. American soldiers also built buildings that they are still proud of for monitoring or monitoring China's military movement. The US also builds a seawall of the road as a portification of their base, which is a hindrance to the descent and rise of fishermen to the sea. With a 7-day simulation and live fire exercises in the area, small fishermen were not fishing. "We have a hard time here," said one fisherman. "What if we were in the mood and then their rockets suddenly fired?" <br><br> 9 | The US of the imperialist war in China, the threat of life and freedom of the Filipinos4) On May 1, 2023, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Joseph Biden, president of the US, signed the bilateral defense guidelines, a document re -adopted the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) of 1951, a colonial agreement that tied the Philippines to US foreign policy of US foreign policy . In the "guide" prepared by the US, it sets funding, training and arming the AFP to serve the puppet army in its goals against China. In April 2023, the Philippines signed a 5-10 year security plan for "modernization" of AFP weapons, camps and facilities. Since the MDT, it has served as a basis for the US invasion of the internal national issues and dragging the Philippines into the wars that the US has entered in the past seven decades. In 1947, the US pushed the Military Bases Agreement (MBA) and used 65,000 thousand hectares of agricultural land and ancestral land to be the base of American soldiers, and the storage of its weapons, including nuclear weapons. These bases have been made by US aggression forces in these wars. The MDT served as a destination for other military agreements, especially after the Philippine Senate dismissed the MBA in 1992. Among them were: Visiting Forces Agreement: 1998, signed by the Ramos regime. Allowed free discharge and stay of large numbers of American troops, and gave them extrateritorial rights. <br><br> 10 | US imperialist war in China, threat to life and freedom of 2006 Filipinos, the US developed the Security Engagement Board (SEB), based on the VFA, to set AFP's "community" activities "and easier to manage Large Wargames like Balikatan. Also through Seb, it is determined what the Philippine weapons "buy" in the US, under the US Foreign Military Funding program. Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement: 2014, signed by the Aquino II regime. It allowed the construction of exclusive US military facilities and bases within AFP military camps to use them as a dump of US military equipment, or the rest of American troops in the country. This is now the basis for building military bases wherever the US wants in the country. 5) Is the AFP really saying that it will focus on the "external defense" and that it will leave counterinsurgency? To date, there is no indication that the AFP plans to focus its attention on the external defense, despite the DND secretary's statements. To this day, a majority of its battalions have focused on the NPA guerrilla fields despite its "insurgency-free" There are many, all of the provinces and it has declared the "stable internal peace and security" situation in many parts of the country. In fact, General Romeo Brawner Jr, Commander of the AFP, re -issued a dedicated Dedlayn on March to crush all guerrilla fields by March 31, all NPA vertical formations on June 30, and all NPA units at the end of the year. <br><br> 11 | The US of the imperialist war in China, the threat of life and freedom of Filipinos, supported this assignment of bombings and bombings from the air and the uninterrupted bombings in Abra, Negros, Bukidnon, Iloilo and Quezon. There is also no violation of its units in the laws of modern warfare, and human rights of millions of civilians. From 2021, the US has poured $ 2.1 billion worth of weapons provided or sold in the Philippines including jet fighters, missile, bombs, howssers, and other weapons. In the US compass, the AFP intensified the anti-revolutionary war that was allegedly used by the use of state terrorism. In conjunction with the operation of the Pacific Eagle-Philippines operation, the Trump government pushed Duterte in October 2017 the declaration of terrorist and the NPA and the end of the peace talks. With the US and its agents at the AFP and the security sector, the more vicious "anti-terrorism law" was enacted in 2020. Since then the brutal anti-Gemilian tactics also used by the US in Vietnam including bombings, extrajudicial killings, and bombings from the air have been implemented. The widespread cases of AFP and PNP violations of human rights and blasphemies of international humanitarian laws are pushing some progressive US legislators to insist that the US stop providing military assistance to the Philippines. 6) What are the roots of the US and China military ribs? The roots of the US and China, which began to intensify in the mid-2000s, were economical. Since the end of the 1970s, the US has supported China's continuous transformation from socialist to being capitalist, including monopoly bureaucrat capitalists in China. The US has favored China in trade and <br><br> 12 | The US stolen the imperialist war in China, threats to life and freedom of Filipinos ("most favored nation"). It allows China to develop its own industry in conjunction with the growing part of production, especially in the field of technology. The monopoly-capitalists of the state in China benefit the offensive of neoliberalism or liberalization, deregulation, and privatization in China and around the world. China quickly transformed into a newly emerged imperialist power. The monopoly-capitalists in China have exported capital in the form of loans and investments. Russia, it has established its own economic bloc (BRICS) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. China has repeatedly strengthened its military forces and its overseas operations. These include the construction of military bases on seven artificial islands in the South China Sea and within the Philippine maritime territory, to control the trade route here. The construction of these military bases is an explicit military aggression and is against the Philippine naval rights recognized by the International Arbitral Tribunal's decision under the United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Seas (UNCLOS). During the economic era, the US renewed this China's strengthening. Following the financial crisis in 2008, the US complained of its trade in China, China's control over a major part of the global trade. The US has pushed for the formation of trade blocks that settled in China, in conjunction with the implementation of protective policies. In 2011, the US government declared the "Pivot to Asia" to rotate the focus of its military forces from Europe and the Middle East to Asia. <br><br> 13 | US imperialist war in China, threat to life and freedom of Filipinos under the Trump government to the Biden Government, the US imposed on Chinese economic pressure, allegedly to punish it for disobeying the "global principles . ” The US also imposed pressure on importing agricultural products from China. 7) What is the party's stance on Taiwan's issue? The PKP supports Taiwan citizens in the militant resistance to US use in Taiwan as a piece of geopular strategy. It criticizes the US interference in China's internal affairs, as well as China's militarist response. It supports the goal of the proletariat and the people both of China and Taiwan for the peaceful and seems of a war in the Mindoro Ocean The Occidental Mindoro Ocean is a war-war-war area when the US launches a “Maritime Cooperative Activity” in January in Cabral in Cabral Island, covered by the West Philippine Sea. As the American soldiers showed up, along with their Filipino soldiers, two Chinese warships were watching them in the distance. The MCA aims to prepare the US on ships and army of the Philippines to bring them into a war against China. Three such activities have been held by the US from December 2023 to February this year. <br><br> 14 | The US has been stunned by imperialist war in China, threats to life and freedom of Filipinos of the resolution of the issue of their reunion. The CPP, and the Filipino proletariat and the Filipino people, along with the whole world, are opposed to the US warfare in Asian war and against its use of the Philippines as a source of aggression in Taiwan and against China. The US has long been using Taiwan as a piece of hegemonism in its Asia and economic and military struggle with China. For the past 75 years, it has used Taiwan as economic and military land to advance its strategic geopolitical interest in the Asia-Pacific region. The US considers the Taiwan part of the "first-island chain" strategy to prevent China's rise and strengthening as imperialist rivals. It is actively funding and pushing groups to Taiwan to assert the "independence" to undermine China's handle. It continues to pour funds to raise Taiwan's military strength. 8) Will the imperialist war between the US and China be about to break? With the US attack against China, the possibility of war outbreaks has grown. It is a manifestation of the intensity of the inter-imperialist riot amid the widespread crisis of the global capitalist system. The US forces to maintain itself as the primary and unique power worldwide. It is an attempt to change the world's developing division and seize the markets and sources of raw materials in control of its rivals imperialist power. The US is urging China in conjunction with its continuous war in Ukraine against Russia. <br><br> 15 | The US of the imperialist war in China, the life and freedom of the Filipino warsThe US-exposed US wars are exacerbated by the largest US military companies that have a billion dollar pipeline. In Ukraine, the US has dumped a large portion of its military equipment, while pushing other imperialist allies to provide advanced weapons. The US has also dumped in military equipment in the Philippines. However, any US attempt to invade China's armed forces will be futile and fail, as many times have proven that American troops have entered Mainland Asia (Vietnam, Korea, China). US military experts are aware of this, so its hard work of the military scenario is to push China to "invade" Taiwan to justify "defending Taiwan." All of this aims to push China to take the initiative and force the word of Lt. Gen. James Bierman of the Third Marine Expeditionary Force to "first shoot" ("Own The Starting Gun". Bierman compared the US to the US military presence in Japan and the Philippines for several years of US war in Ukraine against Russia. 9) Why is the US war in Asian warfare and freedom of Filipino life and freedom? The US left-wing war of war, in particular the military confrontation in China on Taiwan's issue, as well as pushing for strengthening the operations of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea, is It provides a major threat to the lives of Filipinos and the country's freedom, as well as the life and freedom of various countries in the world. The construction of US military bases as part of the US "Theater" Theater " <br><br> 16 | The US of imperialist war in China, the life and freedom of Filipinos are being abused by the Philippine rights in self-determination. The US's use of the AFP as a support for force in aggressive aggression is increasingly trampling on the country's independence. It explicitly denies the rights of those Filipinos to have independent foreign policy. It seizes the Filipinos the right to decide whether the participation in the US -pushed war is in accordance with the national interests and desires of Filipinos. The US has involved the Philippines in its aggressive military policy. The possibility that the US uses its facilities in the Philippines to fly missiles, launch jetfighters, or service its warships, is not a long-distance reason for the country to target the country of Chinese invasion. The Marcos regime's abandonment of US orders and the independence of the Philippine independence causes the country to be involved in wars that have nothing to do with its national interests. In exchange for a military and political favor, the Marcos regime follows the US military's preferences and needs for the construction of bases and facilities. On the other hand, such as the Duterte regime, the Marcos regime has no spinal cord in the face of China's outright blasphemy in Philippine maritime territory in building military bases, and China's seizure of the Philippine Ocean. China's oppression of the Philippines, especially Filipino fishermen, is now being used by the US publicity to justify and capture the sympathy of Filipinos in its strengthening military presence in the South China Sea. <br><br> 17 | The US of the imperialist war in China, the threat of life and freedom of the Filipinos10) What are the roles of the revolutionary movement in the fight against the imperialist war between the US and China, and other imperialist war in the world?

They need to call for the termination of the US Operation Pacific Eagle-Philippines and break its operations in the country. They should stop the launch of Balikatan, other oppressive Wargames and other intrusive military activities.
