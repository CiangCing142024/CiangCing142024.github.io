  The horrible massacre of workers continues uninterrupted. Yesterday another 5 
 deaths at work, 5 workers' lives, young people, elderly, migrants, 
 broke for the profit of the masters, for the system it produces 
 death of workers, for the government that on safety at work 
 It is fully demonstrated by being an agency, a consultancy office 
 of the masters.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It was not yet 
 off the echo and nor will the echo of the massacre of Florence be turned off, where 
 The workers were buried alive by the collapse of the certificates 
 to the construction of a new large shopping center 
 of Esselunga.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We already have 
 very said on this, reported, supported the protests on 
 territory, also supported the strike - banal and limited - 
 organized by the 2 -hour confederal unions. We denounced the 
 Government responsibility, the system, of the assassins.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But these new ones 
 Dead tells us that the complaint we do - just and necessary - 
 it is insufficient and that you have to go inside the events they produce 
 These dead workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Factory 
 First of all, because it is easy to describe working conditions 
 that there are in construction or are in the places where more easily 
 The life of the workers is at risk, but in the factory in general it is 
 hidden, it is less evident that the work is harmful, that the work is 
 fatal and that the profits of the masters are exactly the other face 
 of the planet of exploitation at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Caserta it is 
 Giuseppe Borrelli, 26 years old, a boy from Volla, in the 
 Neapolitan, crushed and dead in a press of the lamination 
 Thin, in the factory of the Moschini group that is based in San Marco 
 Evangelist, in the province of Caserta. It was alone when you are 
 verified the accident.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The group 
 Moschini is not a factories. The Moschini group has plants 
 In Italy, England, Turkey, Canada, South Korea. That of San Marco 
 It is not a factories, 400 workers work. Transform into 
 Aluminum films for food the profiles T 30/40 m. Borrelli 
 He worked there from three or
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 Four years, it's not even clear. But his 
 employer was not the Moschini group, for which he worked. The 
 Moschini Group was awarded by Mattarella, a few years ago, 
 of the honor of the Knights of Labor for special merits of the 
 Republic. The contract that Giuseppe Borrelli had with the GI 
 Group, an interim agency. It was the latter that had taken it 
 permanently and could move it from one customer to another 
 On the basis of the requests and it was Gi Group who paid him the salary 
 on the basis of the contractual settlement of metalworkers.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The figure of 
 This young worker is of staff leasing, that is, for rent, worker 
 for rent.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  To the company 
 this was very well because they had qualified personnel but, in the 
 at the same time, no direct contractual constraints with them.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  With the contract 
 Staff Leasing The worker feels perpetually in the balance, lives one 
 condition of eternal precariousness in each of the factories in which 
 Work. It is a young worker eternally blackmail and 
 therefore objectively available to accept business requests 
 of its use. If you are a leasing staff worker and you are considered a 
 Rompisciolele, the company takes you and respects you with the sender without 
 have no obligation to keep you at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Borrelli died 
 in the factory and there are other workers who carry out the same tasks 
 Yet the classification of these workers is different from 
 that of Joseph, because next to the time hires 
 indeterminate there are the precarious workers of the contracts of the contract, of 
 subcontracting and finally those provided by the inter -analysis agencies.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But yesterday another worker also died, a 38 -year -old worker, this time at 
 Jindal Films of Brindisi, the large industrial group 
 of the world steel that has disputed until the last 
 The acquisition of the ArcelMittal, the former Ilva. Later it has 
 was part of the Piombino steel, reducing it, too, 
 In an eternal layoffs waiting for better times. Daughter 
 by Jindal, the Vulcan Steel, is one of the possible buyers now 
 of the former Ilva of Taranto in the context of the new assignment to the new 
 master. So Jindal has other factories, minor plants, 
 not organically inserted in the steel plan. And one of these is 
 in the industrial area of Brindisi.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Gianfranco Conte, 
 38 years old, married and father of two children, died crushed by one 
 coil while working in the Jindal Films factory that it produces 
 Polyethylene movies, therefore a type of production different from 
 that of the steel. He was maneuvering a carroponte inside the 
 factory when it was overwhelmed by a coil, it was 
 centered in full chest. The impact was violent, remained for 
 a few minutes reactive, so much so that he himself turned off the switch 
 of the machine and asked for help. But gradually that the minutes 
 They flowed worse, he lost his senses. Upon arrival of the ambulance 
 The conditions were very serious. The impact with the coil caused 
 internal injuries. The race to the hospital was useless. AND 
 deceased a few minutes after arrival in the emergency room.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now there is 
 The investigation, but what is clearer than this death?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  At Jindal there 
 There was no security. Already on 27 August last year it was yes 
 Check another serious injury. And here it had been a worker of 
 Sixty years to risk life with a hand stuck in a roller. 
 Also there the worker had reacted, he had also had the blood here 
 cold to turn off the system switch. And here it had been 
 Saved, even if seriously injured.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So it is 
 evident that in this factory there is no security, there is never 
 was. And the workers, even in cases of accident, are alone. Yes 
 They must save life alone. Another worker also died 
 In Carpenedolo, Brescia. In Castellammare di Stabia, however, it is in the 
 Fincantieri who died a worker from Sri Lanka hit by a 
 illness. We still don't know much about this death.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But there are not 
 were only died in the factory yesterday. Often in a single day they die 
 More workers in multiple jobs. In San Giorgio a Liri 
 (Frosinone), a sixty year old fell from the compactor for the 
 separate collection and died.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  What to do? 
 We have to listen to the litany of government/masters/press/unions 
 Confederali? We must once again wait for the strikes 
 immediate that in general are there, but that they immediately come 
 Forget?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 In this description of the dead there is already the reason for these 
 dead, circumstances can be random but it is 
 First of all of the question of contracts, cascade subcontracts, 
 These are the increasingly faster processes e 
 dangerous, it is the lack of control, it is 
 companies that may safely not take into account security, 
 Knowing that however nothing happens to him, they are situations 
 in which workers in the same conditions have different contracts e 
 So even that narrow self -control constraint is lacking 
 and solidarity. It is the absence of the union within the 
 factory, where the union line is always a collaborativeist with 
 masters and helpless to defend the conditions of the workers and the 
 workers do not see in the union a self -defense tool e 
 also a point of reference during their work and less than ever 
 A point of defense to prevent these situations from happening.
 </p>
 <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   But it is clear that 
 until the structural conditions of precariousness are attacked, 
 the structural conditions of low wages, the structural conditions 
 reduction of safety costs and their impossibility of 
 be imposed through the legislative and criminal system that becomes 
 and less efficient in hitting these responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The choice of 
 government is that of collaboration with the masters, is that of 
 Protection of the masters. And evident that this means deaths on 
 Work.
