 Lenin states that the most essential need of the working class is political knowledge and political education.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "Everyone agrees that it is necessary to develop the political knowledge of the working class, but how is it necessary to do this? The economic struggle compels the workers to pose only the problems which concern the relations between the government and the working class, and therefore, no matter how much effort we make to "give the economic struggle itself a political character," we can never, within these limits, develop the political consciousness of the workers to the level of Social-Democratic political consciousness, because the limits are too narrow."
 <br/>
 <br/>
 This is truly an important thing in general and here and today, in the effort that we communists do to develop political consciousness and, consequently, the political organization of the workers. Instead, first of all our companions and in general the workers or militant companions who are persisting on
 <span>
  <a name="more">
  </a>
 </span>
 Doing, marching and operating in a obstinate direction and contrary to the address of the vision that Lenin teaches us, that is, to remain within the too narrow limits of the economic struggle.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The capital error of all economists: the belief that the political consciousness of the workers from the inside can be developed so to speak of their economic struggle. That is, starting only, or at least above all, from this struggle. This conception is radically Wrong ... and it happens so that we do not literally understand each other and we talk two different languages ".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 And that's exactly what happens in our communist organization and even more in our relationship between communists and workers' avant -garde.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 "The political consciousness of class can be brought to the worker only from the outside, that is, from the outside of the economic struggle, from the outside of the sphere of the relationship between the worker and the master. The field from which only it is possible to draw this knowledge is the field of the relationships between all classes and strata and the state and the government, the field of mutual relations between all classes ". Therefore to the question to do to bring political knowledge to the workers, the economist replies limiting himself to the intervention in the economic struggle, to speak to the workers of the issues that "interest workers", when - Lenin insists "to bring political knowledge to the workers I Social Democrats must go among all the classes of the population, in all directions the drappes of their army must send in all directions ".
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the context of the present situation, in which the forces are limited, the militants are few, it is evident that this means in practice bringing to the workers the general political situation, the situation of all classes of the population, the situation of the movements that develop within it. That is, to use the weapon of propaganda and agitation that translates into workers' knowledge of what is really happening and to feed it into class political consciousness.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Lenin, therefore, takes into consideration the real activity of what he calls "social-democratic circles" and which today must be understood as the activity of communists organized in the various social realities of our country, and in particular those who actually operate, today very few, towards the working class, to which we would add today, because they are the most widespread, who operate in general among the workers.
