  <p>
   The revolutionary processes in Russia, China, Eastern Europe, and other regions in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Asia, historically and even to this day, some with more contributions and successes than others, give an account of the validity, validity and actuality of the ideology initially developed by Marx, and of its upper phase today: Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.
