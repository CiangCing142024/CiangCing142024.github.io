 The Greek state wants to condemn the 11 militants from Turkey again as a result of its cooperation with US-EU imperialism and the Turkish state.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 CONCLUSION IN SUBSCRIBE PAG: TUE 19 March 2024, 09.00
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The Attorney General of the Supreme Court, Achilleas Zisis, has appealed against the acquittal given to the 11 fighters' Court of Appeal after 97 days of hunger strike. The appeal was notified at the same time, where the NATO summit was held in Vilnius, Lithuania, where Mitsotakis, Erdogan and Biden agreed to closely cooperation in all areas.
 <br/>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The date of appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal has been set for March 19, 2024. The Supreme Court's Attorney's Office calls for the appeal of the Court of Appeal and the return to the Court of First Instance, in 30 years in prison for each and every one!
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time, the Greek state holds 4 of the 11 fighters, Halil Demir, Ali Ercan Gökoğlu, şadi Naci Özpolat and Hazal Seçer political prisoners in Kassandreia, Chania, Trikala and Women's Thebes, respectively, for a case where they were sentenced to 3 And 9 months without suspension for misdemeanors! In a case where he was set up by the "anti" terrorist so that they would not even be notified to attend the court. The 4 comrades and the others who were convicted in this case were fully removed the right to defend. Obviously, this conviction is also currently used to imprison the fighters before the appeal.
  <br/>
  Imperialism and cooperating states are trying to criminalize anyone who resists their policies.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the face of legal terrorism of imperialism and Greek state, Konstantina Kartsiotis and Hussein Sunniu began a hunger strike on February 19th and for a month in front of the Supreme Court, while political prisoners Ali Ercan Gökoğlu, Hazal Seven February 26, with requests:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Do not be upheld to appeal the Supreme Court's Deputy Prosecutor on March 19
  <br/>
  2) Correction of Chalkida's decision
  <br/>
  3) against the new Criminal Code
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The attacks on the militants are part of the total legal terrorism that imperialism and bourgeois states want to impose. Part of the same class attack is the new Criminal Code, where it is a harsh upgrading of the legal arsenal of the system.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  From Palestine to Turkey and Greece, we know very well that terrorists are not the militants and the peoples who resist, but the imperialists and the cooperating bourgeois states. United to fight and win.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  WHITE TURKEY FRIENDS FROM TURKEY!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Struggling against imperialism, fascism and exploitation is not a crime! ITS A DUTY!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Make the request of the hunger strike!
  <br/>
