  The so -called "Mayan Train" is held as a prestigious project by the powerful of Mexico. Behind this wonderful name is hidden a mega-lethal project of the imperialists, a waste of millions on account of the population and the environment. On the side of the people there is great resistance, especially of the original peoples, which they completely reject and fight against the "Mayan Train" as an attack against their way of life and democratic rights.

   High speed train for tourists - the population resists
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  With 160 km/h, the high speed train advances as a ray on the 1,500 km railway routes through the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Mexico. From now on, construction costs exceed 2.5 times the initial costs (from 7.4 billion to almost 20 billion), which are extracted from the pockets of the population through taxes - for the increase in profits from Foreign consortiums. While this train is not for the population, but to increase overwhelming tourism in the region. And all on account of the historical territories of the Maya, the workers and peasants in the region and finally of a unique ecosystem, which is important for the survival of Mexico.

    Mexico's "Industrialization" or Bureaucratic Capitalism?
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   What the Mexican president Andréz Manuel López Obrador calls part of an even larger project of the "industrialization of southeastern Mexico", is nothing more than another liquidation of the country to imperialist monopolies, in the case of the "Mayan train" especially to The French Trene company Alstrom. This means the opposite of real industrialization or economic development, but a stronger subordination and exploitation of the land and the population for foreign capital. The powerful of Mexico take the role of lackeys for the interests of foreign monopolies. He

    “Periodo Mural”
   </a>
   From Mexico it explains this relationship well: “
   <em>
    This example helps to understand the phenomenon of bureaucratic capitalism in the oppressed countries because, subject to the domination of imperialism [...] science, technology, the means of production, production itself, imports and capital are the property of imperialism and for its private benefit, while export and commercialization will be the task of Mexico in a megaproject that links "Tren Maya" and the Interoceanic Corridor with a more extensive railway network throughout the country. Central America."
   </em>
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   The "Mayan Train" is connected to another project hostile to the people – called the Interoceanic Corridor. This corridor should be called a "Giga-project" because it consists de facto of 12 mega-projects, which are to connect the Atlantic and Pacific with a freight railroad. In short, these projects threaten everything in southern Mexico and are based on the economic interests of the imperialist monopolies. It also now leaves behind a gigantic trail of blood in the country.
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Despite the hard repression, the population does not let himself be intimidated and struggled bravely against these attacks against their way of life. Also numerous international solidarity activities strengthen this struggle and show the bond of oppressed in the fight against imperialism. So we share the slogan here
   <em>
    "Against the mega-projects of dispossession and death, fight and resist."
