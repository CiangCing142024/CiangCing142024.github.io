  Thousands of Greenlandic women had IUDs involuntarily implanted to prevent them from becoming pregnant in the 1960s-1970s by the Danish colonial authorities. This was done to reduce population growth in Greenland â€“ an evil and cynical expression of population control as part of the colonial policy of Danish imperialism in Greenland.

  During the 1950s to the 1960s, the birth rate in Greenland rose by 80%, with 1,781 children born a year in 1966. In 1966 the decision was made by the Ministry of Greenland and the National Board of Health in the Danish state to implement spirals in 4,500 of Greenland's 9,000 estimated Fertile women, that is, 50%. Greenland's population was at about 40,500 at this time. The so -called 'spiral campaign' reaches its highest intensity in the period between 1966 up to the 1970s, when the interventions are done without the consent of young women, some of them down to 12 years old. Danish imperialism succeeded in reducing population growth through its cynical assault, but in 1974 will have to leave politics. Not because it regrets its inferiority, but because its politics has succeeded and at the same time fearing backlash in the form of rebellion and criticism of its politics from, among other things. UN - Several of whose conventions that have been broken throughout the process.

  The forced state war was performed in a period of time when Greenland
  <em>
   formally
  </em>
  Had ceased to be a Danish colony - but is still in practice today. At this time, Greenland was nevertheless subject to the Greenland Ministry of the Government, which saw that the compulsory conflicts were introduced into the so -called
  <em>
   Spiral campaign
  </em>
  . The assaults were allegedly done to
  <em>
   Population growth should not prevent the modernization of Greenland
  </em>
  In other words, not to get in the way of Danish imperialism's desire to continue its dominance over Greenland. Many people in Greenland do not speak Danish, yet only Danish was spoken in the operating rooms and the doctors were Danes. Many of the girls were not informed that they were sterilized, both due to the language barrier, but also because it was kept secret for both them and their family.

  Greenlandic population growth has never recovered since

  Although the policy was officially abandoned in 1974, it remained unofficial for many years. In 1992, the local authorities in Greenland took over the health field, where the policy continued with another 14 Greenlandic women who had spirals implanted without consent.

  The assaults have done permanent damage to many women today, who experience many genes such as abdominal inflammation, severe pain, irregular bleeding and permanent tissue damage and sterilization. The spirals that were used at the time were that the type Lippes Loop and was much larger than those used today, and were also only intended for women who had already given birth before. Among other things. For this reason, the spiral has led to permanent trauma in many of the women's abdomen after sitting there for decades.

  The involuntary contraception does not only belong to the distant past. The British media BBC has revealed in an interview with 4 Greenlandic women how there is knowledge of at least 4 cases of involuntary birth confusion, made by the authorities in Greenland, since the turn of the millennium. Information has too

   reported
  </a>
  About at least three involuntary provoked abortions conducted by the authorities in 2004, 2010 and 2013.

 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Currently, 143 Greenlandic women are suing the Danish state and seeking compensation of DKK 300,000 each for their suffering. This case is currently getting a lot of media attention. The bourgeois Danish state and the authorities in Greenland are currently using the case in LEDs with a "historical investigation of the Danish-Greenland history", DKK 45 million is allocated by the state for this purpose. This
  <em>
   Elucidation
  </em>
  is in the led with the ongoing process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands to go from colonies to semi -colonies. Danish imperialism therefore has to admit many of its crimes and
  <em>
   Example
  </em>
  in order to continue its exploitation of Greenland and its strategic position in the Arctic.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The transition from colony to semi-colony for Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be understood as a deliberate act on the part of Danish imperialism. It is a way for it to refine its exploitation of the countries, as this is more stable than an official colonial form. At the same time, it is an expression of the fact that revolution is the main trend in the world today, it is a sign of the decay of imperialism and the collapse of the last remnants of the colonial system in the world. Danish imperialism has learned from the lessons of the people's anti-colonial struggles in mainly Africa and Asia and has chosen to pre-empt them by dictating the process itself. The inter-imperialist contradictions must also be taken into account, with mainly Yankee imperialism gaining renewed interest in the Arctic in its rivalry against Russian imperialism. At the same time, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has now attracted the attention of other imperialists who want to develop mining in Greenland.

 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands must therefore be understood as a sign of weakness for Danish imperialism and imperialism in general, which is no longer able to take care of colonies, and that the masses in Greenland and the Faroe Islands defiantly continue to fight and resist.
