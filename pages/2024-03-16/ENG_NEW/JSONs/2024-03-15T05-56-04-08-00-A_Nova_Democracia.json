The purpose of the act is to reschedule once again the rejection and condemnation of coup, whether it is that consummated in 1964, which is now freely granting in the barracks and society; as well as demarcate the conciliation and appeasement that only feed the scammers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The political act will also crown the launch of the latest edition of the book\n  <strong>\n   Resisting it is necessary\n  </strong>\n  , from the mining of the great and historical revolutionary militant and genuine Democrat Alipio de Freitas - who has been boomed, since 2010, the title of member of the editorial board of the newspaper\n  <strong>\n   AND\n  </strong>\n  , besides president of honor of the Liga of Poor Peasants (LCP).\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  About the political meaning of the act\n </h4>\n <p>\n  No manifesto do ato, or\n  <strong>\n   AND\n  </strong>\n  It states: \"It is urgent that we undertake serious combat of coup, condemning the 60 years of the military coup of 1964 and the coup still today.\" \u201cThose events are not a\n  <em>\n   trauma\n  </em>\n  to be forgotten. To pretend to forget it, as defended by the President of the Republic Luiz In\u00e1cio and the ultra-rightist general Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, obviously contributes to its repetition. After all, it is not a healed wound: as January 8 demonstrated, the wound is still open and without proper treatment. Even today, as much as in the 1960s, the weeds of the coup grow all over the corridors and meeting rooms in the barracks.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  The text also points out that \"the same policy of vigorous appeasement has been repeated since 1988, the genuine democrats, progressive and revolutionaries will hire a new military crisis, which rests on an irresolved base, will be more serious and dangerous.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cAs part of combating the policy of appeasement (only a way of cowing),\n  <strong>\n   We demand that the special committee on the dead and missing politicians be reinstated\n  </strong>\n  by the government of shift, because it is a demand felt from family members and of unique importance to bring to the national political debate the fascist horrors of the military regime.
