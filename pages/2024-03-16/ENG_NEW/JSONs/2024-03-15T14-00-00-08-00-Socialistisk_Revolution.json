Greenland's population was at about 40,500 at this time. The so -called 'spiral campaign' reaches its highest intensity in the period between 1966 up to the 1970s, when the interventions are done without the consent of young women, some of them down to 12 years old. Danish imperialism succeeded in reducing population growth through its cynical assault, but in 1974 will have to leave politics. Not because it regrets its inferiority, but because its politics has succeeded and at the same time fearing backlash in the form of rebellion and criticism of its politics from, among other things.

The spirals that were used at the time were that the type Lippes Loop and was much larger than those used today, and were also only intended for women who had already given birth before. Among other things. For this reason, the spiral has led to permanent trauma in many of the women's abdomen after sitting there for decades.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  The involuntary contraception does not only belong to the distant past. The British media BBC has revealed in an interview with 4 Greenlandic women how there is knowledge of at least 4 cases of involuntary birth confusion, made by the authorities in Greenland, since the turn of the millennium. Information has too\n  <a href=\"http://(https://www.information.dk/moti/2023/09/nye-spiralsager.groenland-sygeplejerskerne-begyndte-hviske-mens-laa-paa-briksen)\">\n   reported\n  </a>\n  About at least three involuntary provoked abortions conducted by the authorities in 2004, 2010 and 2013.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  Currently, 143 Greenlandic women are suing the Danish state and seeking compensation of DKK 300,000 each for their suffering. This case is currently getting a lot of media attention. The bourgeois Danish state and the authorities in Greenland are currently using the case in LEDs with a \"historical investigation of the Danish-Greenland history\", DKK 45 million is allocated by the state for this purpose. This\n  <em>\n   Elucidation\n  </em>\n  is in the led with the ongoing process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands to go from colonies to semi -colonies. Danish imperialism therefore has to admit many of its crimes and\n  <em>\n   Example\n  </em>\n  in order to continue its exploitation of Greenland and its strategic position in the Arctic.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  The transition from colony to semi-colony for Greenland and the Faroe Islands must be understood as a deliberate act on the part of Danish imperialism. It is a way for it to refine its exploitation of the countries, as this is more stable than an official colonial form. At the same time, it is an expression of the fact that revolution is the main trend in the world today, it is a sign of the decay of imperialism and the collapse of the last remnants of the colonial system in the world. Danish imperialism has learned from the lessons of the people's anti-colonial struggles in mainly Africa and Asia and has chosen to pre-empt them by dictating the process itself. The inter-imperialist contradictions must also be taken into account, with mainly Yankee imperialism gaining renewed interest in the Arctic in its rivalry against Russian imperialism. At the same time, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has now attracted the attention of other imperialists who want to develop mining in Greenland.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6787\" data-attachment-id=\"6787\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"billede-4\" data-large-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/billede-4.png?w=825\" data-medium-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/billede-4.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/billede-4.png\" data-orig-size=\"900,759\" data-permalink=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/03/15/spiralkampagnen-og-dansk-kolonialismes-social-engineering-i-gronland/billede-4-14/\" height=\"759\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" src=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/billede-4.png?w=900\" srcset=\"https://socialistiskrevolution.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/billede-4.png?w=900\" width=\"900\"/>\n </figure>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  The process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands must therefore be understood as a sign of weakness for Danish imperialism and imperialism in general, which is no longer able to take care of colonies, and that the masses in Greenland and the Faroe Islands defiantly continue to fight and resist.\n </p>\n <span id=\"wordads-inline-marker\" style=\"display: none;\">\n </span>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/03/15/spiralkampagnen-og-dansk-kolonialismes-social-engineering-i-gronland/", "type": "article", "title": "\"The spiral campaign\" and the social-enginering of Danish colonialism in Greenland", "description": "Thousands of Greenlandic women had IUDs involuntarily implanted to prevent them from becoming pregnant in the 1960s-1970s by the Danish colonial authorities.
