This dismissal is not an isolated fact for workers, the revenge - noticeable redundancies are increasing and they are certainly not only those known. Last year, 3 of the 7 members of the Board of Directors of the Association of Workers in Thessaloniki, 8 employees from the multinational \"Taskus\" were fired. They are dragging the PENEN union to participate in a general strike, while prosecuting criminal and disciplinary teachers because they resisted the policy of hitting rights at work and life.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The laws of Hatzidakis -Georgiadis legislated the already impoverished working conditions in the private sector, liberated the \"hands\" of employers to dismiss whenever they want and arbitrarily against the laws that the government itself has passed on the eyes of the world. It is a common secret that gifts are either not paid or withheld with the threat of dismissal. Particularly in the food-tourist industry overflows, exhaustive work rates, reduced wages are the rule.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  At the same time, most strikes come out illegal, the demonstrations are hit by the MATs, and even the propaganda of the strike in workplaces are essentially prohibited.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  In the face of this situation that will get worse day by day and accuracy to \"break bones\", workers need not to accept the policy of poverty, poverty, redundancies as \"regularity\". They need to be organized and fight against his policy of \"all in capital\" and \"all for capital\". Overcoming the sold out unions coming out of the obligation, with the \"mobilizations\" in spectacle terms or the strikes in the air. The mass collective struggles aimed at victory are the ones who can put a brake on the anti -populist - deceitful storms. With a massive front against redundancies and persecution, the appetite for the employer will be cut!\n  <br/>\n  <u>\n   <br/>\n   <b>\n    Studently return to work student at work!\n   </b>\n  </u>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  REALLY INCREASES IN SHIPPING AND PENSIONS\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  DOWN THE ANTI -ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS HATZIDAKI -GEORGIADI\n </div>\n <div>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Chania, 15-03-2024\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9", "\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1", "\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1", "\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2", "\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_56.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
