An ordinance \n of the Administrative Court of Turin has now ordered \u201cLa \n suspension of the effectiveness \u201dof the sheets of via, the first step towards \n the cancellation, which will however be discussed in almost a year, in January \n 2025. The reasons of the judges underline \u201cprocedural anomalies, which \n  they would not correspond to any typical act of judicial police or a \n  a correct establishment of a contradictory \".\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       The via sheet, reintroduced in the Italian system pursuant to \n of law 159/2011 for the fight against organized crime, is \n provided for those who are \"usually dedicated to criminal trafficking\" \n  or that \"their behavior must be considered, on the basis of \n Elements of fact a danger to safety \". It is a \n provision given by the commissioner, with very large discretion, which he has \n Immediate and upsetting effects on the legal and personal sphere. \n For these reasons, careful investigation would be foreseen on \n elements that justify its adoption.

THE \n  identifying hours of hours, fines, pretentious complaints, sheets \n in via ... they are all practical that the police regularly uses for \n scare, to isolate, to criminalize whoever manifests.
