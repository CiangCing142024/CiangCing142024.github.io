The youth, along with the people, to resist the policy of dependence and war that puts us to accept the war barbarism, which prepares us to become meat in the canons of imperialist killers!\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the Palestinian people's long slaughter in the Gaza Strip is escalating, the country is even more strongly involved on the US-NATO-EU's warfare and imperialist plans. The local bourgeoisie and its government continue the work of the \"good child\" of the murderers of the peoples: from the total sell -off of the land, the air and the sea of the country to the NATO bases to the policy of imperialist dependency involved in this people of the place in the bloodthirsty designs of Americans and Europeans.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, Thessaly is one of the Blood Baths that have opened and maintained by West's imperialists in Ukraine, Palestine and the Middle East. The active involvement of NATO bases in Larissa and Nea Anchialos, the exercises of America and French Marines in Pelion, the F-16s above the Thessalian plain and the warships in the port of Volos are elements of a policy that must find the people and the people The youth of Thessaly on the streets of the race.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - We do not accept the country's involvement in the bloodshed of the peoples of the planet.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Outside the bases, NATO and Americans from our country. Outside the EU, Greece is not a protectorate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Down the hands of Gaza! Victory in the weapons of Palestinian resistance! Free Palestine, with a single and independent Palestinian state, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Outside the US-NATO and Russia from Ukraine. No people need patrons.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Down the policy of imperialist dependence, poverty and war.\n </p>\n <div>\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b9\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2", "\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc", "\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/303-1600_25.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
