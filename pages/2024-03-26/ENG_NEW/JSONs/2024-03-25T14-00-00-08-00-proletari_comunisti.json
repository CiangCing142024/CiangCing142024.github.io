Valditara, Salvini and a good part of the mass media. Valditara announced checks on the Pioltello institute; there have been threats to the headmaster, Alessandro Fanfoni. But also a lot of solidarity and sharing towards the Headmaster's decision.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   This story is emblematic and serious. The attack on Pioltello's decision this time also combines the repression of mere knowledge, information on the Palestinian reality, of the Arab peoples, to humoral racism,\n   <b>\n    A conception and politics that speaks of \"\n   </b>\n   <i style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n    national identity in shattered\n   </i>\n   <b>\n    \".\n   </b>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <span>\n    That is, respecting different cultures would undermine this national identity, the only one that must be imposed.\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <span>\n    What is this if not fascism?!\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "Today the institute council, convened in extraordinary session, will have to decide whether to confirm the suspension of lessons for April 10 ...", "author": ["fannyhill"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-25-marzo-scuola-di-pioltello-che-il.html", "source_name": "proletari comunisti"}
