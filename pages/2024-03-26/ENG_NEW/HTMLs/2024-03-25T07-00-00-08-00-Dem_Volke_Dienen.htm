   Oaxaca without water, drought or looting?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">

  <img alt="oaxaca sin agua 2" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/Oaxaca_Wasserknappheit/oaxaca-sin-agua-2.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/Oaxaca_Wasserknappheit/oaxaca-sin-agua-2.png" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In recent months, more than 4,326 hectares of land have been affected by terrible forest fires caused by the latifundium or as a phenomenon during the dry season. In addition, in various regions of Oaxaca, such as the Valles Centrales, Mixteca and Costa, there is a water crisis that threatens entire populations and now also public hospitals and schools.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  A clear example is the situation of the central hospital "Dr. Aurelio Valdivieso" in the center of the capital of Oaxacas, which set up its work on February 22 after it had no water. It is obvious that a hospital cannot work without offering the patient and the medical staff a minimum level of health conditions, and therefore the supply of drinking water is essential. In this context, the defense lawyer of the human rights of the Oaxaca people created a protocol on precedent and issued precautions in which he asks the state to "take comprehensive measures to avoid damage that is caused that are difficult or not at all are fixed and affect the right of citizens to health. "
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the capital of the state of Oaxaca, it is reported that at least 6 public schools had to stop working and have to return to online lessons because there is no longer any water in their facilities. The youngest are the urban mornings "Carlos A. Carrillo" in the Colonia Reforma and the morning primary school "Enrique Pestalozzi" in the city center. The fact that the children have no access to drinking water in their schools violates their right to education and health as well as other rights that are in the children's interest.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Until a few weeks ago, the shortage of drinking water was concentrated in the popular neighborhoods, which are generally located on the border and in the hills of the city - nothing new. For decades, there have been dozens of neighborhoods labeled "illegal settlements" where poor people have no access to drinking water or other public services; Hundreds of small schools are in the same neighborhoods in the same situation. The various governments have systematically ignored this situation, leaving the solution to the problem to the residents, who have had to resort to private water pipes, which took advantage of the dry season to speculate on water prices.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  But now that the water crisis has reached the city center and the "good" neighborhoods such as Reforma, San Felipe etc., the situation has become a scandal; All the more than visible public institutions such as the general hospital and the schools mentioned above had to hire their work because of the water shortage.

 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  At the same time, companies in Oaxaca continue to work for non -alcoholic drinks and breweries, as well as large hotels, restaurants, vice centers and even health resorts that prepare for Holy Week and beautiful tourism. None of them have a lack of water.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Are we dealing with a phenomenon of drought or looting? You can give the answer.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a health emergency and the exposure of the work for these industries and companies were proclaimed during the pandemic, the same in the middle of this water crisis, which is also a health crisis, should be done, in addition to the regulation of the water price, the pipers organized in the union mafia on sale is.
 </p>
 <p>
  The guarantee of general access to drinking water as a fundamental right is a vital necessity and not the upcoming elections. The money spent on the election campaign and candidates should be invested in municipal water collection and supply systems for the population.
