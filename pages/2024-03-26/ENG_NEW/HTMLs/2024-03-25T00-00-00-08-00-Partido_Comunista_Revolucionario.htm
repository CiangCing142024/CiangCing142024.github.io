   The town in the streets took in their hands the flags of the denunciation of the bloody blow of March 24, 1976, which inaugurated a dictatorship that swept democratic rights to impose an economic plan at the service of the ruling classes and imperialist powers.
  </p>
  <p>
   Almost fifty years later, it was seen in the streets that the claim of memory, truth and justice is more in force than ever. The generations that lived those years, and those that came later, lift the fight flags and make it clear that there are 30,000! and that it was a genocide orchestrated by state terrorism.

    Interviews in the Plaza de Mayo
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Luciano Álvarez,
   </strong>
   General Secretary of the JCR told us that “on a new anniversary of March 24, 1976, for us it is very important every year to mobilize in the Plaza de Mayo and throughout the country to repudiate the coup and claim the history of our party that proudly we were opposing the coup and since 1974 we opposed the coup and defended the constitutional government of Isabel Perón.
  </p>
  <p>
   “This year we do it with particular importance that has to do with what is the first year that we do in the government of Javier Milei, a government that came to claim the dictatorship, which came to refloat the theory of the two demons, And we say that there are 30,000, that it was genocide and where we are going to look for them.
  </p>
  <p>
   “It is also important to do so considering that there is an idea that youth supports this government and a number of things that are not true because here there is a youth that comes to claim the history of the 30,000 missing and especially to Pose that we need to build an Argentina with land, roof, work, health and education for all and for this we have to defeat this policy of adjustment, hunger and repression ”.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Juan Carlos Alderete,
   </strong>
   Coordinator of the unemployed and precarious movement of the CCC and national leader of the PCR pointed out that “48 years after the genocidal coup today we go out massively to face this government that claims that fierce dictatorship that the Argentines had, a tremendous denialism that this government has, which is even spoken to pardon those genocides. Today is a very special day and year for memory, truth and justice.
  </p>
  <p>
   “We are going to be on the street permanently, to repudiate this policy that Javier Milei is carrying out, which is a business policy mainly punishing workers, retirees, who have nothing, with tremendous perversity. That is why we are on the street and we permanently seek the unit to turn and that this policy fails because if they are not going to leave a destroyed country that will later cost generations to be able to rebuild it ”.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Rosa Nassif,
   </strong>
   National PCR leader told us that
   <strong>
    “
   </strong>
   This March 24 as every year is an honor appointment for the revolutionary communists. This day we pay our tribute to all the fallen martyrs in the antigolpist struggle and in the anti -dictarorial struggle and in them all who have fallen into the struggle for national and social liberation.
  </p>
  <p>
   “But today more than ever this March 24 has a special meaning when it is in the Government the most reactionary of the right that in addition to fascism, adjustment and delivery that discharges over our people, has again put into discussion if in the Argentina has been a true genocide that has led the lives of 30,000 militants, workers' delegates, peasants and student, have been a loot of this dictatorship to apply an economic plan that is the same as today Milei, Caputo and his entire clique. An issue that has to do with neatly pay usure debts with the IMF and other creditors. And the people are told that there is no money because the money is taken, the crapulas are always united to the different imperialisms and fulfilling the mandates of paying weight by weight what they owe to their owners.
  </p>
  <p>
   "That is why we fight the broadest popular unity to stop this policy, twist Milei's arm and advance with another policy and another government, a government that truly represents popular and national interests."
