   On March 18, 1871 the proletariat and other workers in Paris 
 overthrow the reactionary domain of the traitor government of the 
 French bourgeoisie ... and established the Municipality of Paris, the first power 
  proletarian revolutionary politician in the history of humanity. It was one 
 Epocal revolution of great flow for the whole world. Was the first 
 attempt by the proletariat to overturn the bourgeoisie and to establish the 
  dictatorship of the proletariat.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   During the Franco-Prussian war, France had undergone one 
 Disastrous defeat. The French bourgeois government, traitor, had 
 transferred territories to the enemy and paid large sums of money for the 
 war allowance, while implementing a cruel repression of the 
 people at home. It is in this situation, in which the entire nation was 
 tormented by a growing misery and class contradictions yes 
 they acute every day, that the proletariat and the other workers of 
 Paris launched an armed insurrection.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   After its foundation, the Municipality of Paris adopted a series of measures 
 aimed at abolishing the old permanent army, to build the forces 
 Armies of the people, to completely destroy the old system 
 bureaucratic politician who enslaved the people and to create a system 
 of universal suffrage. It is just as Marx underlined: the 
 Municipality of Paris is "the dawn of the great social revolution that will free 
  Forever humanity from the regime of the classes ".

   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, since at the time the French proletariat was not 
 sufficiently mature and powerful and was missing from the guidance of a party 
 Marxist politician, the leaders of the Municipality of Paris were unable to give 
  following the victory of 18 March obtained by chasing and annihilating 
 completely the reactionary forces of
   <span>
   </span>
   Thiers, piled up in Versailles. 
 Did not carry out a firm and decisive repression of the 
 counter -revolutionaries. They did not expropria the capitalist bank of France. 
 Nor managed to form an alliance with the farmers. All of these 
 factors led to the final strangulation of the great 
 proletarian revolution by the joint forces of the enemy in 
 homeland and abroad. But in front of the frenetic counterattacks of the enemy, 
  The heroic sons and daughters of the Municipality of Paris fought 
 valiantly in a spirit of maximum devotion to the revolution. For 
 Defending the Municipality fought to the last drop of blood. Their 
 brave and heroic deeds will always shine with a light 
 dazzling.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   At the time of the revolution of the Municipality of Paris, Karl Marx yes 
 He found in London. He actively supported the revolutionary initiative of 
 Parisian proletariat. Two days after the defeat of the Municipality of 
 Paris, Marx, in his brilliant work
   <em>
    The civil war in France
   </em>
   , 
  described the great achievements obtained by the heroes of the Municipality e 
 he summarized the experience and lessons of this revolution. In light of the 
  attempt by the Municipality of Paris to establish the dictatorship of 
 proletariat, Marx stressed: "La
   <em>
    working class cannot
   </em>
   take possession purely
   <em>
    it's simply
   </em>
   of a car
   <em>
