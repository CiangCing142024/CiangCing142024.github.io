  Following the statement launched by the International Communist League, where it is written “We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against any kind of aggression against the prisoners, to be the voice of the prisoners outside, we must support their struggle under the conditions of imprisonment as part of the class struggle outside.” The newspaper

   Hamburg
  </a>
  , Germany, on the occasion of the Day of the Political Prisoners and the anniversary of the Commune of Paris. People invited by the Hamburg Palestinian Alliance attended.
 </p>
 <p>
  The event began with the song “The woman in the commune” followed by the context of March 18, marked by the anniversary of the Commune of Paris. Following this the interview with Professor Saibaba, who was recently released, was highlighted. The political prisoners in Turkey and Kurdistan and the torture methods used against them, then were shown and spoken about.
 </p>
 <p>
  The persecution of Daniela Klette, accused of terrorism in Germany, and how solidarity samples have also been harshly repressed, were also highlighted. Once again, the need to show support for Palestine was discussed.
