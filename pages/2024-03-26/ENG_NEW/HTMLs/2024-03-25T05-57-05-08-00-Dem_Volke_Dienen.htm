  In the past two days, demonstrations in solidarity with the people of Palestine have taken place in NRW, one of them organized by the Red Bund of North Rhine -Westphalia. We were sent a report that we want to publish here at this point
 </p>
 <p>
  On Friday, March 22nd, the demonstration "against genocide and crew - freedom for Palestine" organized in Essen as part of the "Open Palestine Bochum". The opening rally at 6:00 p.m. opened a speech by the comrades of "Palestine Anticolonial", who took the long way out of Münster to support the demonstration. The speech denounced the complicity of German imperialism and made it clear that the advanced forces within the anti-imperialist and Palestine-solidary movement in the FRG will not be banned from the bourgeois state and its media.
 </p>

  <p>
   Shortly afterwards, the demonstration with about 150 participants pulled off powerfully despite rain and shortly before the start of fasting. Anyone who did not take part in the demonstration was the MLPD. The MLPD had explicitly forbidden the open Palestine meeting, since no advertising for bourgeois parties was desired on the demonstration. After this then heard the first two speeches and the subsequent demonstration savers, it left the demonstration, since apparently their bourgeois respect was violated, since nobody wanted to distance themselves from the national resistance struggle. Without your own flags to stage yourself on the demos, and without a denunciation of elements of national resistance - the MLPD does not take to the streets. Good this way!
  </p>
  <p>
   After sunset, including at the intermediate rally, sweets, dates and water were distributed (some of which were donated by local Bochum restaurants in solidarity) and there was another speech by the Palestine Solidarity Duisburg. It refer to the crimes of the imperialists against national liberation movements around the world and that, such as in Algeria or Zimbabwe, they are defamed as terrorism. Furthermore, the speech dealt with the criminalization of the slogan "From the River to the Sea - Palestine Will!", Which was also prohibited at this demo in Bochum, but was nevertheless called by the demonstration.

   </p>
   <p>
    The following day, together with some other participants of the open Palestine meeting, we took part in a Palestine demonstration in Essen, where the banner against genocide and crew was also carried and some editions of the revolutionary newspaper "Rote Post" could be sold under the demonstration participants.
   </p>
   <p>
    Around 100 people gathered in the demonstration in the city center of Essen on Hirschlandplatz. A loud and combative demonstration was celebrated, which was accompanied by a loudspeaker car. Loud slogans were tuned all the time, even if they had a significantly more pacifistic orientation than the day before. As always, the police put on strict requirements such as the ban on the slogan "From the River to the Sea Palestine Will" or the ban on the denial of an Israeli state.

   </p>
   <p>
    In summary, it should be said that both demonstrations - but above all the demo in Bochum - were important moments to consolidate a consistently anti -imperialist point of view among the participating forces. In the question of whether you are on the sides of the oppressors or oppressed, there is no middle ground and those who represented this experienced a clear flap on Friday. What is missing and what is to be developed is the perspective; the need for the Communist Party in Palestine is to focus. This is the only way to become a People's War that is actually able to create a Palestine for his people.
