  TA 75 YEARS OF NATO to convert to demonstrations over Palestinian and by imperialism and war
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>
   Calls on Thursday 4 April, 18.30 in FREEDOM PARK and on the US -Israel Embassy Park
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  Israel - US - NATO - EU with the support of the GREEK GOVER
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  To stop the genocide, the bombings and the siege of the Palestinian people!
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  NO EMPLOYMENT OF GREECE IN THE SLAG OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE-OUTSIDES, OUT OF NATO
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
  LEFTERIA IN PALESTINI - NIKI IN PALESTINIA RESISTANCE
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The genocide of the heroic Palestinian people in Gaza, the murders on the West Bank and the forthcoming invasion of Rafa by the Zionists trigger situations with unpredictable consequences throughout the wider area of the Middle East, and not only!
  </li>
  <li>
   Despite the genocide and war that lasts five months, the armed Palestinian resistance to a leather and independent Palestine continues, and reveals Israel's inability to neutralize it.
  </li>
  <li>
   US, EU and NATO imperialists support the state -murderer. American imperialists seek to control situations in the area, proceed with new adventurism and open new war fronts, sending frigates to the Red Sea.
  </li>
  <li>
   New wars are erupting in the region and internationally, in the context of the imperialist pursuits of the planet again, while the Ukrainian front is still with NATO to carry out the greatest military exercise with the involvement of all 31 Member States, while the debate on The official mission of troops of NATO and EU members to war has been opened!
  </li>
  <li>
   The ND government has chosen a side, openly participating in the war on the side of Israel and dyed its hands with the blood of the Palestinians! It is dangerously involved in the country in war! The Greek Frigate Hydra added to their fleet in the Red Sea and the conversion of Larissa into an administration and the rest of the country into a war base even militarily help Israel to continue the bombings and siege of the Palestinians and escalate the Greek people!
  </li>
  <li>
   Throughout the globe, the peoples demonstrate massively, daily, demanding that the genocide be stopped for freedom in Palestine!
  </li>
 </ul>
