   Today feminicides are not the result of an old patriarchism, in which women were considered, and often felt, subordinated, lower, etc., but of a new reality.

   They are the result of the male reaction to the claimed female freedom, to the fact that women do not feel inferior, indeed sometimes better, superior to their husbands, to the men with whom they have had or have a relationship, and therefore do not accept oppressive bonds, in which the male must decide for them and impose his will. Hence the men who hate women and kill them.
   <b>
    This reaction is fascist and is cultivated by a humus general of modern fascism. This modern fascism generates a modern patriarchism.

    This explains why feminicides cannot be stopped, will increase, and surely this government, this state cannot hinder them.
   </b>
   And it indicates that they can only be reduced with the organized struggle/fury of women that has the objective of the overthrow of this government, state, capitalist system, more and more from "God Homeland Family"
