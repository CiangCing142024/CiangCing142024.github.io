  Intervention in the central square of the city was organized by the KKE (M-L) on Saturday, March 23, with announcements by the telecoon and a proclamation. The anti -populist policy of the government and the system was overall, and the path of organized struggle was promoted. The response of the world was quite positive, which has been found in other interventions lately. There are clear indications of the depth and breadth of the attack that touches wide social strata and the concerns and pursuits that develop within these strata.

  · Battle with precision says that the government gives and promises to increase (crumbs) to the basic salary, but cuts the extraordinary Easter allowance because "the economy can't stand".
  <b>
   And the popular family is narrowing in poverty and poverty and restricts basic needs to bring out at least the first fortnight of the month ...
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  · "Students may not be deleted" (struggling), says the prime minister, who just a week ago voted for Pierrakakis, who drives away the children of popular families from universities and prepares a new abortion of class barriers for children with high school children. The so -called national diploma. Laws must work,
  <b>
   49 Student arrests and asylum violations in Thessaloniki, but also ongoing disciplinary and criminal prosecution of teachers because they simply exercised their trade unions ...

 <p>
  <b>
   Through race committees and initiatives,
  </b>
  who will rally people and youth to develop resistance and claims, for free care and education, for cheap energy and the goods of popular need for safe and cheap transport.

 <p>
  <b>
   The student's massive race,
  </b>
  that was closed by the KKE forces at universities and other supposedly left-wing factions to focus on the European elections coming,
  <b>
   left indelible his stamp on youth consciousness,
  </b>
  but also in wider layers. So are the agricultural mobilizations.
  <b>
   The mass strike on 28 February showed that there is enough anger, possibility, and a need to open the road of the race !! For a front of resistance and claim, for work, education, peace, life with rights.
