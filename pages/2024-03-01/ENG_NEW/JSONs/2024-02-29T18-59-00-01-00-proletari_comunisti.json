The government, to collect \n money with so -called small savers, has decided to issue a title of \n Was called BTP value, which can be purchased for a minimum cut of 1000 \n euro, and which gives the right to an interest (miserable in reality).\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  Until now the government has collected just over 16 \n billions ...\n  <b>\n   on which he will have to pay the interest that will be added to those \n Approximately 100 billion of interests per year for public debt\n  </b>\n  .\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  We do not enter into the merits for now who is this \u201csmall \n savers \", who are the\" families \"to whom Meloni turns ...

Meloni if \n You care about logic! \u201cThis, he concluded,\u201c allows us from a part of giving \n to citizens a tool to secure savings and on the other of \n be more masters of our destiny because when your public debt is \n In your hands you are less subjected to external pressures \".\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  First: as the statistics on current accounts and i \n deposits still in banks the problem is not at all \u201cto secure i \n You save \u201dlending them to the state, it has nothing to do with it! The request for\n  <b>\n   remove \n from the drawer of the small savers\n  </b>\n  their money and enter them in \n Italian production system is above all of the Italian masters who repeat it many \n times especially from the columns of the Sole 24 Ore!\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  Second: the public debt that Meloni calls\n  <b>\n   \u201cThat\u201d,\n  </b>\n  For \n captivate the sympathies of the small saver and the \"families\", who yes \n finds in the hands of the masters and high foreign finance is around the \n 800 billion!
