It's the new times, \u201dhe thinks. But writing for a newspaper, the finding is kind of defeatist. It is still doubtful that people do not want to be informed. Social networks bombard information, true and false, and they are certainly visited frequently for this purpose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We need to transform the realization into a question: what's wrong with the newspapers then? - These instruments that Machado de Assis, optimistic, but nothing naive, said to shake the aristocracies and illuminate a new time of social reforms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now the aristocracies of the time of Machado de Assis and before him certainly feared the newspaper. Almost coupled with the rise of the bourgeoisie, the free press made not a few nobles choke. In Brazil, they waged the wheels of progress while they could and the press could only settle, and still under strong persecution in 1808, if considered the press release of that time. In European countries where the bourgeois revolution took longer to happen, as in the case of Germany, real papal bulls were imposed by monarchical censorship to contain the spread of \u201cdangerous ideas\u201d, especially when it began to notice a new danger: the proletarian struggle . During the nineteenth century, the already hesitant bourgeoisie and tending to betrayal, began to give up the idea of freedom of the press. Bourgeois freedom has become too freedom for the desires of the bourgeoisie. Not a few times, the clandestine media were the only possible for democratic journalists, as in the case of our country's secret literary societies in the eighteenth century.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Machado also said: \u201cThank God, if there is anything to expect is that of proletarian intelligences, the tiny classes; of the superiors, no \u201d. Nothing naive, as I said. It was these superior classes that kidnapped the freedom of the press to themselves, denying it to any other class. It is like? The only way they know, with money.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the same time, proletarian intelligences continued to flourish and began to reject this falsehood that is undergoing freedom of the press, subjected to the spurious and unhealthy needs of the bourgeoisie: inventing economic growth while the people starve, inventing high employment rates while The people have no work, justify a genocide etc. etc. etc. It was left to the point that in 2013 the broadcasters had to use uncharacterized device on the streets to cover the June demonstrations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Yes, the tradition of opening the newspaper is lost to many and for now. But I do not think it is replaced by the television newspaper, that the pasta, when they watch, either seems to them a mockery or is mocked.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I also don't believe that it is the social networks that took their place, particularly. Social networks are generally used to find out precisely what would not appear in a newspaper. That this means that nothing genuine information is credited is just proof of the extension of investment to ideologically obscure the truth. Remembering Lincoln, however, it is not possible to deceive all people all the time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Machado de Assis was right, even if not entirely. Freedom of the press scares the upper classes, the ruling classes, that is. But instead of \u201ccutting the eagle wings that throws themselves into the infinity,\u201d they decided to nose the eagle in the midst of their flight. Thus proved that the word, the\n  <em>\n   fiat\n  </em>\n  , it can only break free and become creative force when it is not subjected to the gross and perfidious tyranny of capital. Otherwise it remains attached to the fourth circle of hell next to Petruchio, where the condemned\n  <em>\n   collide with each other\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  Some have no problem with this, and on the contrary, we face lies as well-fed pigs. Maybe for these it falls an even lower place, the\n  <em>\n   Malebols\n  </em>\n  , the circle of eternal damnation of counterfections.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Lenin, in 1917, sent a draft resolution on the freedom of the press to the provisional government of the proletarians and peasants, determining that the first measure to ensure press freedom was to create an \u201cinquiry commission to investigate the ties between capital and. Periodicals, the sources of their funds and revenues, the list of their donors, the coverage of their deficits and all other aspects of the general journalistic business. \u201d Clearly dictatorial measure! Dictatorial for those who were bound by the misery of the people, dictatorial to those who sang the music of the tsar and imperialism to try to deceive the Russian workers and to launch them to the machine of grinding imperialist war people. For the people, he recommended that a fair part of the paper stock and print instruments were sent between groups of about 10,000 people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Through this tour, I go beyond ax and say that not only the ruling classes fear freedom of the press and democracy. They fear that true freedom of the press is the suppression of his false freedom of the press. They fear above all that the awareness that true democracy is the suppression of its false, and bankrupt, democracy is elevated.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thus, the tradition of opening the newspaper may be lost, because the big (at least in size) newspapers, those who are press monopolies, have lost-and increasingly bury it under the rubble of gold-coated chimerers, but crowded with Blood - Any moral authority over the masses. I still remember when, a child, I heard at Globo that he uses it was fighting Taliban's terrorism in Afghanistan and that seemed undeniable truth. Today, some councilman has been said to have a hole in a country town, the stressed interlocutor himself makes the fact contestable.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Defending a free and democratic press, supporting it and disseminating it is not, however, fighting the current of time, but to ensure that \u201cthe worker who withdraws at home, fatigued by the daily work, will find it next to Bread of the body, that bread of spirit, social host of public communion, \u201das our greatest writer said. What the spirit of the worker rejects is the bonus bread that they want, the strength, push him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I believe, therefore, at the end of the question of the death of this great tradition of opening the newspaper in the free and democratic press. She, who was born and growing initially almost coupled to the rise of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois revolutions, not very different from factories, is truly tied to the grand collective destiny of humanity, to the revolutionary destiny of humanity.\n </p>\n <hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   This text expresses the author's opinion.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/cronica-liberdade-de-imprensa/", "type": "article", "title": "Chronicle: Freedom of the Press - The New Democracy", "description": "Nowadays, the tradition of opening the newspaper is already lost. \u201cWhat to do?
