A 40% difference which, although calculated as the INPS does with the same conditions (age, contracts, hours worked), never resets and reaches a 12-13% stable.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;\">\n   Almost half of Italian women work in part-time (47.7%) against less than a fifth of men (17.4%). The paid days in one year to women are 221 against 234 of men. And this explains a lot about the gaps. \"\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;\">\n   And the public sector is not even saved, says the journalist, \"considered safe and sheltered from inequalities. Instead no. \" Because: \"The salary gap, albeit lower than the private individual, exists: 5,200 euros per year, 15-20 euros per day: 28,400 euros against 33,600 euros per year, 95 euros against 114 euros per day. The gap is created from the growing appeal in the PA of short contracts, especially in school and health, where the presence of women is relevant. Even the part-time, certainly less present than in the private, concerns women twice the men (6% against 3%). Two thirds of all public workers are women. \"\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;\">\n   \u201cThere is no escape even at home. Parental leave is asked for 80% by women. And the gap with his companions is very large, especially up to the three years of his son. The fathers, when they ask, are mostly workers from large companies and full -time. While 46% of applicant and part-time mothers.\n   <b>\n    Women penalized at work, in the paycheck, at home and then retired\n   </b>\n   . Not a nice see. \" But it is clear that this study is limited to direct or deferred salary (pensions) and not to\n   <i>\n    <b>\n     working conditions\n    </b>\n   </i>\n   <i>\n    .\n   </i>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;\">\n   Therefore when the newspaper of the Agnelli puts \"on the defendants' bench ... intermittent careers, broken by maternity and care needs.
