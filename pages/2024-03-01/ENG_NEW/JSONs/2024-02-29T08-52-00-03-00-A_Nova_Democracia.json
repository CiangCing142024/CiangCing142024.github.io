This unfair war generated hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded and millions of displaced, caused misery and pain to all the Ukrainian people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thanks to the heroic defense of his homeland by the people of Ukraine, despite the traitorous national regime led by the Zelensky Yankee, the Russian aggressor has not been able to fulfill his maximum war goals.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is fair and correct to reaffirm what the International Communist League (LCI) issued a year ago:\n  <em>\n   \u201cThe main contradiction is that among Ukraine, a country oppressed by imperialism, and Russia, an imperialist country. Regardless of the class character of the Ukrainian regime and its service to the interests of other imperialist powers, especially from Yankee superpower, any confusion over this point leads to Ukraine to its right to independence and national sovereignty and therefore at least indirectly, support the interests of Russian imperialism \u201d,\n  </em>\n  as well as\n  <em>\n   \"The long-term plan of the Yankee to surround and ultimately defeat their only nuclear equivalent and the Russian counter-menus to resume lost positions, is the key factor that leads to war.\"\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is particularly noteworthy, and it was also proved correct, which was then written:\n  <em>\n   \u201cZelensky's regime is in a sharp contradiction with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian people, trafficking with their fair patriotic feelings, applies absolute centralism and there are no democratic rights, whatever they may be, to the people. Opinion, meeting, and organization rights are suppressed by draconian and chauvinist repression and the regime depends on fascist military formations open to crush all expressions of popular discontent. Sabota the independent armed resistance of the people by relying on weapons, eagerly provided by NATO led by the Yankee, fearing the armed people who is the only one who really defends the nation\n  </em>\n  \u201c.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is an important fact. Because today it is clear and obvious that the main reason Zelensky's regime is unable to defeat the Russian imperialist aggression - despite all the heroic sacrifices of the Ukrainian people - it is because these homeland traitors trust imperialism, especially yankeeper, and Not in the masses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is expressed, among many other things, in the case of the fall of Avdiivka, a small town in the Donetsk region. A bitter tragedy, as these wars write them.\n  <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/ukrainian-avdiivka-soldiers-messages-intl/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   As reported by the press\n  </a>\n  The soldiers parked there made desperate attempts to escape the ruins of the city. One of them wrote:\n  <em>\n   \u201cIt was just a matter of survival. The road to Avdiivka is full of Ukrainian corpses. \u201d\n  </em>\n  A commander informed the radio that the injured would not be evacuated. The men were left behind to be executed by the Russian invaders. In this way, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have made the decision to abandon the city, surrendering to Russia their most significant victory since captured the city of Bakhmut last year.\n  <em>\n   \u201cThe ability to save our people is the most important task for us,\u201d\n  </em>\n  said Zelensky with the greatest cynicism at the Munich security conference. The New York Times analyzed:\n  <em>\n   \u201cAvdiivka's capture for Russia is a strategic and symbolic coup for the military of Ukraine. Avdiivka was a stronghold of Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region, protecting several important Ukrainian military positions to the west and placing the neighboring city of Russia -controlled Donetsk under constant threat \u201d\n  </em>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  We can see that the current tendency is that Russian imperialism is on its way to slowly realizing its minimum war objectives.

The new head of the Wagner mercenaries, Anton Yelizarov, recently said the restructuring of the organization: \u201cWe are building a camp so that the new units that will be formed - which will become part of the Russian National Guard Volunteer body (Rosgvardiya) - may arrive and establish yourself. \u201d This so -called \u201cCossaco camp\u201d would be \u201calmost certainly\u201d based on the city of Rostov, in southern Russia,\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-explosions-in-kyiv-and-other-cities-amid-mass-russian-missile-strikes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   As reported by The Guardian\n  </a>\n  . This development finally buries all the western speculation and dreams of a military coup against Putin. Navalny's death also serves, as well as the decision of the courts that Boris Nadezhdin is prevented from participating in the next elections scheduled for March 15-17 or the settlement of a deserter pilot in Spain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is not only militarily that Russian imperialism is gaining ground. Economically,\n  <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/russia-oil-india-shadow-fleet-cmd-intl/index.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   as reported by CNN\n  </a>\n  , Russia is entering its third year of war in Ukraine with an unprecedented amount of money in government coffers, reinforced by a record of $ 37 billion in gross oil sales to India by 2023. Thus, India increases your raw Russian oil purchases. Oil in more than 13 times its values prior to war, a trade not subject to sanctions and since then totally legal. Russia's federal revenues fired to a $ 320 billion record by 2023 and are expected to increase further. About a third of money is spent on the war in Ukraine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Also in international politics Russian imperialism is still a force with which it should be calculated, as shown by the last proposal of a meeting of all Palestinian factions in Moscow, in order to create a certain national unit, especially among the two largest factions , Fatah and Hamas,\n  <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-02-18-24/h_d7fe8b0d1648652842b5f5daa65928c1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   As reported by CNN\n  </a>\n  on February 18.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Under these impressions it is necessary to reaffirm the tasks we have ahead, defined by LCI in February last year:\n  <em>\n   \u201cWe must also do everything we can to promote the friendship of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. Two people who were once united as one in the great Soviet union under the red flag with the scythe and the hammer of Lenin and Stalin are now pushed against each other on the battlefield due to the imperialist's intrigues. Communist formation, the revolutionaries and all the consequent anti-imperialists, have a particular responsibility to increase propaganda against the imperialist war of Russia, raising their struggle to new levels against the imperialist state and their war of aggression, by all means within your reach. disposition, also fighting against the imperialist war and the sending of weapons in the respective imperialist countries \u201d.\n  </em>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/dois-anos-da-guerra-de-agressao-russa-contra-a-ucrania/", "type": "article", "title": "Two years of the Russian aggression war against Ukraine - the new democracy", "description": "On February 24 this year, the total war of aggression against Ukraine by Russian imperialism marks its second anniversary.
