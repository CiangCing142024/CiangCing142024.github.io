The statement was given in a statement to the Federal Police on February 23 and revealed by journalist Bela Megale on 29/02. In addition to pointing to the beginning of \u201cSave Who Can\u201d through the barrack in the barracks, the revelation goes against what Freire Gomes had preached here. The former commander has insisted that he did not participate in the coup articulation and even played against the movement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This meeting took place on December 9, 2022, at the Dawn Palace, and was discussed the open institutional break to culminate the ongoing military coup, with the presentation of the so -called \u201cscoring draft\u201d. The information of the meeting was revealed in awarded denunciation with the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mauro Cid reserve. According to messages found on the same military cell phone, Theophilo would have, at the meeting, agreed to board the execution of the coup. If the culmination of the coup had been consolidated, Estevam would have been responsible for triggering and commanding the reactionary army special forces, the \u201c\n  <em>\n   kids\n  </em>\n  for that\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Theophilo's departure occurred a day after Jair Bolsonaro, Augusto Heleno, Braga Netto and other prominent military personnel to the Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia to give testimony. Everyone was silent at the time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was thus steering the standard and joined Mauro Cid on the list of those who will open the game, even partially, about the coup joint. The general's only revelation released to the press so far, in a five-hour statement, has served to incriminate former commander Freire Gomes again.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Gomes, who in a meeting with Bolsonaro said he would not participate in the open institutional rupture, has been trying in recent weeks to carry on the version that \"articulated against the coup.\" So far, no evidence has been presented, and the whole scenario continues to point out for its omission and prevarication against the scammer's coup joint of his high command colleagues.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Now, with the new revelation, at the best of the hypotheses for Gomes, he will be regarded as another general of the military summit which, in recent years, has consented to the increasingly active intervention of the reactionary armed forces in national political life (in models From a silent military coup as designed by the military right), and which in 2022 completely omitted against the open blow planned by its consorts. At the worst, it is once again regarded as one of the articulators of the far-right coup plot.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is also the question of what will be the next reactionary military who will seek to deliver another, superior or lower, to try to save his own skin, thus aggravating the military crisis and further revealing the role of the military summit in the agitation and articulation of the blow. Cid has gone, and Theophilo joined him. What will be the next friendly fire?\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/em-delacao-general-estevam-theophilo-entregou-papel-de-freire-gomes-na-articulacao-golpista-com-bolsonaro/", "type": "article", "title": "In testimony, General Estevam Theophilo delivered Freire Gomes' role in the coup joint with Bolsonaro - the new democracy", "description": "With the statement, Theophilo joins Mauro Cid on the list of the military who delivered consorts to save their own skin.
