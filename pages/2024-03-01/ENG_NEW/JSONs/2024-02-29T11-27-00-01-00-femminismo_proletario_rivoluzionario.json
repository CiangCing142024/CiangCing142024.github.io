It seemed to us that there could be no valid reason, in the face of thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of mutilated and disabled every year on the workplace to adopt the same determination also towards the murders in the workplace. A strong deterrence, preparing a certainty of the penalty and an adequate penalty, if an adequate penalty can exist for those who kill in the name of profit; Opening to new and more incisive powers for workers' representatives for safety, providing for an urgent procedure in the discussion of trade union complaints on the failure to comply with the rules on safeguarding health and safety. Obliging companies to prepare the mandatory risk assessment documents so that they were no longer just a piece of paper to be shown to inspectors regardless of their content.\n   </p>\n   <p style=\"background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;\">\n    His laconic and lapidary response to all this is hasty and inadmissible for us. What would have happened to the workers of the Esselunga construction site if one day they had suddenly decided to stop and go out on the road by stopping the circulation to denounce the serious shortcomings in compliance with the protection of health on their workplace and perhaps also the black work and the absurdity of the Contract system? They would have risked very high penis, up to six years of imprisonment, thanks to the reintroduction of the road block crime. A reintroduction aimed at making you desist from making road blocks or occupations of companies who had in mind to protest for working conditions, against layoffs, in favor of the environment ...\n   </p>\n   <p style=\"background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;\">\n    Luana D'Orazio died because an warpiece to which she had intentionally removed a protection.
