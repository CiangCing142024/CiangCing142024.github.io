This need, as well as the tendency towards the facission and reacting of regimes under their splint, is born from the fear that imperialism has before its general crisis and the growth in the struggles of the peoples in the world. The above applies not only outside the imperialist powers, but also inside. Citing a\n  <a href=\"https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/02/20/brasil-fascismo-abierto-es-la-respuesta-del-imperialismo-al-nuevo-periodo-de-las-revoluciones/\">\n   article\n  </a>\n  From a nova democracy that we recently shared: \u201cHence the political reflexes perceived year after year. Knowing that the unresolved crisis of its regime tends to arouse increasingly powerful uprisings of the popular masses, as has happened incessantly in recent years, the ruling classes use repression as the only alternative. Only in the last two years, countries such as France or the United Kingdom have used or advanced measures and bills to restrict rights as basic as strikes and popular street demonstrations. Throughout Europe, militarization advances at a fast pace: in addition to increasing military budget, organizations such as NATO welcomed Finland as new members in 2023. \u201d\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  Now we have as an exemplary expression of this militaristic tendency in the US Modern of a police training field with a cost exceeding $ 90 million.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  The Georgia State Police and especially Atlanta was the awkward witness of the 2020 mobilizations against racism and police violence, which increased after the news of the murder of Georges Flyod, who was publicly suffocating it by the racist police until the racist police until his death. As the masses lazar furiously, the fear of the Poli grew overflowing.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  In Atlanta this movement continues to increase after the murder of Rayshard Brooks, another black worker massacred by the police during an arrest, in which Brooks resisted trying to avoid being tortured with a taser. He was killed with multiple bullets while trying to flee.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  These struggles and the resistance of the masses in the streets have exceeded the police again and again and are the justification of the gringo imperialist state to build the \u201cAtlanta Public Safety Training Center\u201d complex (Atlanta Public Security Training Center) In the forest, south of the city that in its history has not only for genocide and forced displacement against the people\n  <em>\n   muscogui\n  </em>\n  , but also served as a slave estate and later as a prison that developed a new slave system of forced labor for almost the entire twentieth century. The planned construction includes a helipad and the recreation of a part of the city where they will train the police in the counterinsurgency simulating armed clashes in an urban context.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3930\" data-attachment-id=\"3930\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cop-city-1\" data-large-file=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-1.png?w=750\" data-medium-file=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-1.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"3072,2406\" data-permalink=\"https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/01/ee-uu-una-vision-policial-y-militarista-tambien-al-interior/cop-city-1/\" src=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-1.png?w=1024\" srcset=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-1.png?w=1024\"/>\n </figure>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  The people of Atlanta have immediately stood up against this project, joining different initiatives against the formation of a police state and internal militarization. The different agendas in forest protection, against gentrification, police violence, etc. They have joined a variety of heterogeneous groups and individuals who already develop various campaigns with mass struggle that range from the forest, to the realization of marches and sabotage against machinery and equipment of the megaproject construction companies, after which the FBI and Police have made cateos and raids amid spectacular operations as taken from a gringa film.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3935\" data-attachment-id=\"3935\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"cop-city-3\" data-large-file=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-3.png?w=750\" data-medium-file=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-3.png?w=300\" data-orig-file=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-3.png\" data-orig-size=\"2048,1366\" data-permalink=\"https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/01/ee-uu-una-vision-policial-y-militarista-tambien-al-interior/cop-city-3/\" src=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-3.png?w=1024\" srcset=\"https://muralperiodico.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/cop-city-3.png?w=1024\"/>\n </figure>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n  The latter gives us an exact panorama of the anti-democratic character of the project and confirms the reactionary vocation of the gringo government, who threatens to destroy the social fabric and peace of the African-American communities around the place, and of the same population originally from the forest. In the same way, more than 116,000 signatures (more than twice the votes that the governor of Atlanta received in the past election) were ignored for being \u201clate\u201d, although a judge had ordered a extended extent in the search for signatures that were oppose the project.
