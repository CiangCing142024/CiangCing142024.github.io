    The last study of INPS also confirms the difference in treatment of women who work
   </b>
   In Italy from "young workers to pensioners" as reported an article of the Republic of 22 February last, denying once again, with data and forcefully, Meloni's propaganda shouted by the electoral stages, and not only for the wage difference and pensions , but also for the number of women at work since
   <b>
    Among unemployed and inactive there are several million unemployed women.
   </b>
  </p>
  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   As for the so -called
   <i>
    gender pay gap
   </i>
   , namely the difference in pay, you arrive with regard to pensions at 40 billion!
  </p>
  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   "In 2022 322 billion in pensions and welfare services were paid by INPS.
   <b>
    141 billion went to women
   </b>
   .
   <b>
    To men 180 billion
   </b>
   . With a difference of almost 40 billion. This is despite average, women are the owners of more than one pension, as happens when reversibility is. AND
   <b>
    Although the retirees are more numerous than retirees: 8.3 million against 7.8.
   </b>
   Women are 52% but take 44%.
  </p>
  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   The causes, according to the study, but that women live daily on their skin, are "intermittent careers, chopped by maternity and care needs. Fixed-term and part-time contracts, chosen or mostly forced. But also a structural difference in the hourly salary between men and women (horizontal segregation). Also in the public administration. And everywhere at the highest levels, those of the management, to whom women arrive in a few (vertical segregation). " All this ends "on the defendants' counter".

  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   “Il
   <i>

   </i>
   Start from work. - continues the newspaper - Also in 2022, the annual salary gap between women and men in the private sector was on average 6 thousand euros per year: 17,300 euros account 24,500 euros per year, 97 euros against 106 euros per day. A 40% difference which, although calculated as the INPS does with the same conditions (age, contracts, hours worked), never resets and reaches a 12-13% stable.
  </p>
  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   Almost half of Italian women work in part-time (47.7%) against less than a fifth of men (17.4%). The paid days in one year to women are 221 against 234 of men. And this explains a lot about the gaps. "
  </p>
  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   And the public sector is not even saved, says the journalist, "considered safe and sheltered from inequalities. Instead no. " Because: "The salary gap, albeit lower than the private individual, exists: 5,200 euros per year, 15-20 euros per day: 28,400 euros against 33,600 euros per year, 95 euros against 114 euros per day. The gap is created from the growing appeal in the PA of short contracts, especially in school and health, where the presence of women is relevant. Even the part-time, certainly less present than in the private, concerns women twice the men (6% against 3%). Two thirds of all public workers are women. "
  </p>
  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   “There is no escape even at home. Parental leave is asked for 80% by women. And the gap with his companions is very large, especially up to the three years of his son. The fathers, when they ask, are mostly workers from large companies and full -time. While 46% of applicant and part-time mothers.
   <b>
    Women penalized at work, in the paycheck, at home and then retired

   . Not a nice see. " But it is clear that this study is limited to direct or deferred salary (pensions) and not to

  <p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   Therefore when the newspaper of the Agnelli puts "on the defendants' bench ... intermittent careers, broken by maternity and care needs. Fixed-term contracts and part-time, chosen or mostly forced "tries to give an" aseptic "," objective "framework of the state of affairs, as if all this did not depend on the capitalist-imperialist exploitation system, a system that must be reversed by a political and social revolution.
