  Friday 8.3 at 5:00 pm, Senate Square

  Restriction of strike rights, export-driven labor market model and complication of part-time work-the government's policy of misery led by Petteri Orpo is strongly focused on women and female-dominated sectors. The aim of the government's planned export -driven wage model is to change the legislation so that the percentage of wage increases in the export sectors would set the roof for wage increases in other sectors. If implemented, the reform will leave the nurses and many other underpaid female -dominated sectors in the eternal payroll. We demand the end of all plans for the export-driven labor market model and the restriction of strike rights and a significant financial investment in renewable work.

 <p>
  The cuts in vital support services and social security make one of the most dangerous countries for women in Europe. One in three women living in Finland has experienced physical violence, threat of physical violence or sexual violence, and every other woman has experienced mental violence in a relationship. International human rights bodies have repeatedly criticized Finland for not being effectively rejected by violence against women. We require additional funding to create a shelter network and the low -threshold support services that have experienced intimate partner violence, which are currently strongly focused on the third sector due to the scarcity of funding.
 </p>
 <p>
  The government will also continue to support Israel, which is currently carrying out the Palestinian genocide, and Turkey, which opposes Kurdish. The genocide in Gaza, especially in Gaza, affects women who are struggling with their lives, who, in addition to bombing and approximate execution, have sexual violence in completely non-viable conditions where it is impossible to access normal menstrual and hygiene supplies. At the same time, Turkey, who has been bombing a feminist revolution in Rojava, is allowed to continue its operations as its NATO partners follow. The Finnish government will remain silent in both cases, with more of its trading partners, for which it purchases and sells weapons and defense equipment. We require the suspension of these stores and the immediate termination of warfare.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will meet at the Senate Square at 5:00 pm and go to 5:30 pm through Aleksanterinkatu and Mannerheimintie to Narinkkatori.
 </p>
 <p>
  The demonstration is organized by Aurora Helsinki, the Left Youth of Helsinki, the Kurdish Democratic Community Center NCDK and Riseup4rojava Finland.
 </p>
 <p>
  Aurora Helsinki and the Varis Network will be organizing after the demonstration at 20:00
