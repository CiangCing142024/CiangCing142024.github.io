 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Not a day passes when we do not witness the umpteenth insult of the 
 Meloni government to workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In front of the 
 infinite massacre of workers in the workplace, the lack of 
 safety that is a constant, to contracts, to precarious contracts, to 
 Back of the residence permit for immigrant workers related 
 to work contracts, to black work, to low wages, all 
 elements that are part of the exploitation system it brings 
 profits to the masters and misery and accidents and, often, the death on 
 work of the workers, on the wave of anger and pain aroused 
 from the massacre after the collapse of a gigantic construction site in Florence that 
 He killed 5 workers, the government meets with confederals for 
 tell him what the Minister of Labor has already decided 
 CALDERONI - Consultant of the owners appointed minister now - and then 
 bring a provision to the Council of Ministers which is a 
 outrage, an insult to workers who died at work and that leaves in 
 peace the masters, allowing him to continue to be able to deny the 
 safety exposing workers to risk and get away with it for 
 This.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After all, the 
 the same Meloni had explicitly declared that his government “not 
 puts brakes to those who do "
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So none 
 novelty in the conception of this government that he puts in all his 
 provision his class matrix, the defense of the interests of 
 Masters at the center of his policy, which carries on their war 
 class with contempt and hatred of workers he expresses 
 also in this case even when he is forced to intervene because 
 There are the deaths and accidents of the workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is proper 
 Because from this government it is not "no news" that you need to 
 organize the struggle, put it on the field with all means, 
 organize the unit of the workers, make it pay dear to 
 Masters and government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The news of 
 These days is that the Council of Ministers approved one 
 scheme of decree-law on the implementation of the PNRR, a sort of 
 "Omnibus" decree - with about fifty articles (49 in the 
 draft attached to the article) and which contains this package 
 Work safety in which there would be various "novelty".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister says 
 that this provision follows the three c: “Controls, contrast e 
 compliance for an accompaniment to regularizations, to a 
 regular behavior of companies ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Meanwhile the first 
 insulting novelty is its scope of application: this is a 
 provision that limits its action only to construction sites and not to the other sectors 
 of work, from factories to warehouses to countryside.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The same 
 Minister of Labor and Social Policies, cauldron, has 
 remembered in his information to the Council of Ministers of 
 last February 21 - After the worker massacre on the construction site in Florence 
 - that “as regards the inspection access in construction, the 
 level of irregularity recorded was 76.48%, with a 
 average irregularity rate that exceeds 85.2% in the case of companies 
 engaged in work connected to the Superbonus 110%".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The government 
 It therefore recognizes that there is the violation of the safety rules 
 and on the contracts in construction but acts in the opposite direction instead 
 that increase controls with criminal penalties for contracts e 
 subcontracting, instead of canceling the waterfall contracts, repeal the 
 Salvini decree liberalizing contracts.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The provision 
 he says that hiring will be unlocked to increase the 
 contingent of work inspectors, of the inspection nucleus 
 Carabinieri and inspection staff of INPS and INAIL that will be able to 
 increase controls by 40%.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The propaganda of 
 Government announces another 766 work inspectors, but that in reality yes 
 it deals with 466 hires that will be unlocked (on the basis of a 
 old competition with the Draghi government) and 300 new hires, 
 250 of all these should be destined for safety e 
 on health at work, 50 are carabinieri under the structures 
 inspections, which nationally, in relation to 4,500,000 
 census companies - only those registered, therefore - not 
 Absolutely nothing will change regarding the controls.

 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the heart of 
 This measure is the notorious "points license".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After the massacre 
 worker of Florence, the Secretary General of the CGIL, Landini, 
 Responding with only 2 hours of strike, he said that the 
 institutions and the government must intervene in order not to allow more 
 that other workers die. “The license must be established a 
 points. Companies that do not respect the rules must not be able to 
 work, they must be closed, they must not be able to participate in 
 contracts. Instead, those that respect the 
 safety rules ".
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 government, government union, the CISL also appreciates this 
 tool that - underlines the secretary Luigi Sbarra - 
 it corresponds to a substance to an advanced proposal in 2003 by his 
 trade union.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 Meloni/Calderone/Salvini government took them in question to hit the 
 working conditions of the construction sites.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The license is 
 issued by the National Labor Inspectorate after registration 
 to the company's Chamber of Commerce and provides for the fulfillment, from 
 part of the employer and workers, of the obligations 
 training; possession of the DURC, a single regularity document 
 Tax and the risk assessment document.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And here it is so much 
 Easy to prepare this documentation for the masters, the DVR is 
 even prepared by themselves who define where and which 
 They would be the risks in the workplace for workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The license a 
 Credits should enter into operation from 1 October 2024.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For the company or 
 for the self -employed worker without the license or with a number of 
 credits of less than 15, the administrative sanction from 6 thousand to 
 12 thousand euros.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The score 
 initial is 30: in the event of a fatal accident, 20 are reduced 
 credits, while for permanent disability you go down to 15, for 
 Temporary disability 10 credits are reduced.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this is a 
 insult to the dead workers and all workers the passage of 
 This provision that provides that reduced credits can 
 be recovered with training courses! Other than the tightening of 
 sanctions, as announced the propaganda of the Meloni government, it is 
 of yet another, even more hateful amnesty to the masters because 
 it concerns the life of the workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We reported in 
 a previous worker counter -information after the construction site massacre 
 In Florence: "How much is the life of a worker worth?" And the government, with 
 This provision, replies in a chilling way that for it 
 "It is worth 20 points" but in reality, as we have seen, also nothing, 
 Because a training course is enough to continue as before!
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Remains the 
 cascade subcontracting. The only positive note is that it is introduced 
 The social clause which also provides for the subcontracting the application 
 of the most used contract in the sector, but only applies to the 
 remuneration, not for the regulatory part as the obligations to the 
 training, working hours, etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister 
 Calderone says to introduce "the criminal offense for the interposition 
 illegal labor », in cases where the labor comes 
 administered without there being a regular contract and a 
 detachment of regular staff, this on the one hand, but to the same 
 the civil sanctions are reduced, in the event of violation of the 
 Safety rules just get in order.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And to all those 
 Companies found in order will be issued a certificate and registered 
 (after consent) the employer in a special list 
 IT COMPUTER CONSULTABLE publicly and called “List of 
 Inl compliance ". The masters, to whom the certificate was issued, 
 So they will not be subjected to further checks for twelve months 
 in the subjects subject to the investigations.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nothing changes for 
 The workers of the contract.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No 
 provision to enhance and extend the function of the RLS and the 
 representatives of site safety as well as no location 
 inspection and health in large companies, construction sites, ports, 
 As the Slai Cobas claims for the class union with the struggle 
 in the realities in which we are present.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No 
 provision on wages, precarious contracts, on the breakdown of the bond 
 between residence permit and employment contract, which are the 
 claims of the struggles of the basic unions.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The USB for months 
 is collecting the signatures in support of a law to introduce the 
 crime of murder at work and to present it to the chamber presidents 
 and Senate so that the discussion arrives in parliamentary classrooms e 
 So the Fillea herself, the union of the CGIL building, also does 
 appeal to political forces to modify this provision in 
 Parliament.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How can we 
 have confidence that in parliament something changes? the same opposition 
 who was never done anything to the government yesterday to intervene against 
 deaths at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The CGIL launches a 
 referendum with the collection of signatures (there will be 500 thousand) and the 
 Possible vote in spring 2025. “On the pitch to change the laws 
 wrong and propose another social and development model ”against 
 Job act, layoffs, precariousness and contracts.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But when never the 
 issues concerning the conditions of the workers have been 
 Do you conquer with a referendum? The escalator was perhaps not 
 canceled with a referendum?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  History 
 evidently it continues not to teach or in any case the confederals do 
 other choices as conciliators with the interests of the owners
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The USB organizes 
 for next Saturday, March 2, an event with a procession that 
 It will start from Piazza Dalmatia to the Esselunga construction site and also a 
 Conference in Florence in which the introduction of the crime will be discussed 
 murder at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Surely 
 Returning to the place of the massacre is a decision that we share.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the problem is 
 Always that: who will have to make the laws that are unexpissed the penalties for 
 The assassins?
