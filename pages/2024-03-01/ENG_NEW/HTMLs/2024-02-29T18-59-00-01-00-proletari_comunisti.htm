  In one of the episodes of Telemeloni aired yesterday at 
 Tg2 and pass by interview, the fascist Meloni after having for
  <i>
   just a few 
 second
  </i>
  I play the clothes of the contortion that must "think" on the defeat 
 electoral in Sardinia, passed immediately afterwards to boast of the good result of the 
 government government btp value.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  But what is it actually? The government, to collect 
 money with so -called small savers, has decided to issue a title of 
 Was called BTP value, which can be purchased for a minimum cut of 1000 
 euro, and which gives the right to an interest (miserable in reality).
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Until now the government has collected just over 16 
 billions ...
  <b>
   on which he will have to pay the interest that will be added to those 
 Approximately 100 billion of interests per year for public debt
  </b>
  .
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  We do not enter into the merits for now who is this “small 
 savers ", who are the" families "to whom Meloni turns ... Let's say that 
 Also in this case Meloni takes advantage of it to make nationalist propaganda.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  And in fact, looking at the room, he signed towards the "saver" 
 Speaking of "trust" (given the outcome of the elections in Sardinia!): "The 
 I interpret as a sign of trust by citizens and savers ", 
 The Prime Minister commented (according to https://it.investing.com)- 
 who appreciated the "response to a strategy with which
  <b>
   we want 
 report the Italian public debt as much as possible in the hands of 
 Italians ".
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  How much is the Italian public debt? About
  <b>
   3 
 Thousand billion
  </b>
  ! How much did Meloni collected with this operation?
  <b>
   16 
 Billion
  </b>
  .
  <b>
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  This is the substance of the current problem. "It's possible 
 report the Italian public debt in the hands of the Italians "? Meloni if 
 You care about logic! “This, he concluded,“ allows us from a part of giving 
 to citizens a tool to secure savings and on the other of 
 be more masters of our destiny because when your public debt is 
 In your hands you are less subjected to external pressures ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  First: as the statistics on current accounts and i 
 deposits still in banks the problem is not at all “to secure i 
 You save ”lending them to the state, it has nothing to do with it! The request for
  <b>
   remove 
 from the drawer of the small savers
  </b>
  their money and enter them in 
 Italian production system is above all of the Italian masters who repeat it many 
 times especially from the columns of the Sole 24 Ore!
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Second: the public debt that Meloni calls
  <b>
   “That”,
  </b>
  For 
 captivate the sympathies of the small saver and the "families", who yes 
 finds in the hands of the masters and high foreign finance is around the 
 800 billion! Other than 16 billion!
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  And finally, in the capitalist-imperialist system it is normal that 
 a part of the public debt of each country both in the hands of investors of 
 other countries, foreigners, and in this sense everyone makes "external pressure" each 
 On the other, therefore, all this remains a story to tell to those who fall 
 in the deception of the fascist memory and all "patriotic" of the 
 Meloni.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  While on the shoulders of the proletariat and popular masses, 
 As we said, the weight of the public debt that increases certainly falls 
 everyday more!
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Also for this reason, get rid of Meloni and his 
 Modern fascist propaganda is an urgent need!
