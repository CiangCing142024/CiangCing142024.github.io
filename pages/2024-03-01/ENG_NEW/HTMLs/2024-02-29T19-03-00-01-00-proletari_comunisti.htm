 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The ex Ilva issue must remain the center of the attention of 
 workers, workers. And certainly not only in Taranto, even if a 
 Taranto fights the main battle on this. But there 
 We must tire of repeating that we are talking about the largest 
 factory of this country which is within a steel group 
 which is of great importance both on a national scale and on a scale 
 European, given the world contest that is underway in the steelurge 
 world, worldwide.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  If you don't understand 
 This, all we say has no sense. This is the 
 point on which we are focusing.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When the 
 government, the masters, say that Ilva is strategic - and they go 
 reaffirming also in these hours - on this we are completely 
 agree with the government. The only question is that "strategic" for 
 We have another value: it has an important value for the working class 
 of our country, for the proletariat and everything that imports 
 For the working class and for the proletariat of our country, he has 
 importance in class struggle, in the conflict between masters and 
 workers, in the conflict between masters and government and workers, in 
 conflict between the state of capital and workers, in the conflict between the way 
 capitalist/imperialistic production and workers. The ILVA is 
 strategic but from the point of view of the working class and from the point of 
 View of the working class the plans that produce masters and government 
 they go in the opposite direction to the plans that should produce the 
 proletariat, the working class, the basic trade union movement and of 
 class, the political organizations that care about the question 
 worker and the role of the working class in the current clash with 
 The entire government, with the entire system in our country.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start with 
 end. In Taranto in the morning at 6, in front of the gates, there was the 
 Minister Urso, spearhead in this moment of the application 
 of the strategic line that chose the Meloni government in his 
 together with the service of the most general interests of the owners 
 Italians. The government has chosen to exist and remove the matter 
 Mittal and to resume the temporary management of the 
 factory and then return it to the new masters. New masters of which 
 The final outcome is not yet clear, but the masters are essentially 
 steel, once again represented by the Federacciai e 
 by the other groups engaged worldwide in the dispute 
 on the steel and interest in the Taranto plant that 
 The entire group has in our country.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister came at 6 in the morning to tell the workers of the bales, one 
 fable. “Now that the State has taken up in necessary times there will be the 
 resumption of production, there will be the resumption of workers, there will be 
 the solution of environmental problems in the factory and in the city. " 
 All this is a bale.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister is 
 coming here, he came to Taranto, came from the workers, for 
 tell the story they have told from the beginning of this 
 affair.

 Before looking 
 What has been said to see that this minister was 
 collected by a servant cavalier called Palombella, 
 UILM unionist, majority union within the 
 establishment, National Secretary of Metalworkers of Uil.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Pictures 
 themselves of this "Lord" who on behalf of the workers goes to 
 Open the door, they make it seem the servant of the servants. The unionism, which as well 
 In these weeks he had screamed, now he showed up in his guise 
 of servant of the servants to bring the consent of the workers to 
 solutions that the government is taking. Solutions that do not go in 
 Direction of the return to work of the workers of the surface who are 
 out of work for months, which do not go in the direction of the solution 
 not even their elementary guarantee problems, because everything 
 This, Minister Urso practically reconfirmed it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  From what 
 the solution of these problems, including urgent problems, depending would depend 
 workers? From the EU loan-reward of which the 
 Discussion with the dressger (
  <span data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom="" data-darkreader-inline-border-left="" data-darkreader-inline-border-right="" data-darkreader-inline-border-top="" style="--darkreader-inline-border-bottom: initial; --darkreader-inline-border-left: initial; --darkreader-inline-border-right: initial; --darkreader-inline-border-top: initial; border: none; display: inline-block; padding: 0cm;">
   Commissioner 
 European competition
  </span>
  , ed), from 
 new approach of Europe and on the steelurge, another theme than in the 
 European World Championship of Siderurgia is far from being 
 addressed, and in any case, if it must be addressed, it will be addressed in the 
 framework of the actual power relationships that are in the steelurge 
 European between the different groups and relationships of European steelurgery 
 with world steelurgery.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  “Table for 
 follow closely the application of the support measures 
 to the induced ". Measures that consist essentially in paying 
 Immediately some urgent works, in planning any payment 
 of previous credits and in distributing the layoffs to 
 workers for a period that is not known when it will be. "He confirms 
 of the interest of foreign investors "who, once 
 The Ilva is resumed in the hands of the state and "purged", can 
 be placed to foreign investors, that is, to another Mittal (the most probable candidate seems to be
  <em>
   <span style="font-style: normal;">
    Metinvest
   </span>
  </em>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
  </span>
  of Ukrainian Oligorca in a consortium, more or less consenting, with 
 part of the Italian steel industrialists: it is done in the name of 
 Gozzi, Arvedi and so on).
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Therefore a process 
 that it is said that it will be done within the year, therefore at least within 
 This year there will be no solution or work problems, 
 neither of the problems of wages, nor the problems of the conditions of 
 work, neither of the problems of environmentalization, nor of the problems 
 of the great question of the issues represented by the role 
 pollutant of the Taranto plant.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is useless to say 
 like this is related to what will happen in the factories of 
 Cornigliano and Novi Ligure who are partly related to fate 
 municipality of the group, partly conceived also in distinct form 
 compared to the common fate of the group.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  On what they are 
 Then focus the further statements of Minister Urso Fatta 
 In the following moments of his visit to Taranto at the meeting at 
 Prefecture table, with social partners and institutions? Urso has 
 Also spoken in this case of the same problems. Himself 
 he admits that the loan-panty spoke about it on Sunday with the 
 European commissioner Vestager and that he thinks he can and should 
 realize within the limits of European rules. Moreover this 
 Ponte loan is linked to an industrial plan that 
 Show immediately that the Ponte loan can be returned.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  So in none 
 way it is funds for the recovery but it is a loan 
 which, indirectly or directly, was not granted to 
 ArceloMittal or from it not accepted in those dimensions, and which comes 
 re -proposed at other industrial groups that accept it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "Me 
 I am met several times with the Breton and Vestager commissioners and I have 
 asked to change industry objectives and methods 
 Siderurgica ". Really! Even the Governicchio Meloni, 
 minor partner in Europe - as well as certainly not in harmony 
 Not even with the general interests of the different European masters Vista 
 its location on all themes - should take in 
 consideration the objective changes of the steel industry, 
 otherwise he says - here, yes, rightly - we will be crushed by 
 those who produce outside Europe without respecting the conditions 
 environmental and social and so on, which is obviously connected 
 to the current phase of the world dispute in the steelurge from 
 objectively these effects in the struggle that is underway between 
 they.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "We have 
 the absolute will to relaunch the steel by guaranteeing one 
 environmental safety that is fundamental for us on a par with 
 work safety ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Apart from the fact that 
 This government that, as you know, is antiambientist, that this 
 Government on the problem of safety at work is for full 
 freedom of business and for the liberalization of the contracts that already 
 produce its effects in the working condition, see the latest 
 deaths at work, this government, like all the governments of the masters 
 In recent years, but even more this government, it is far from 
 be able to be the person who can guarantee environmental security 
 and work safety.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Then reconfirm 
 what has been said not from now but from the beginning of the more phase 
 acute of this crisis: “mandatory to keep the 
 maintainers ". But this is trivial, without maintenance the plant 
 It closes, that's it. So what are we talking about?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  "Can not be done 
 send to layoffs those who work for the safety of 
 plants ”and therefore all the others can very well go in 
 layoff with or without return, in non -definable times.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Urso plan is 
 fried air, the Urso floor is what has been said SIN 
 from the beginning, from the early hours, from this government that has not so far 
 made if not preliminary steps forward in the relationship with the group 
 ArceloMittal, where contradictions are generally acute 
 legally represented in what is happening to 
 Bankruptcy Court of Milan, where the 
 failure of Ilva, and therefore of the insolvency and the mass in 
 Extraordinary administration.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In a condition 
 of factory in bankruptcy and extraordinary administration everything 
 What comes after is a logical consequence. The famous credits 
 claimed by the companies, and so on, they will enter the general cauldron 
 of insolvency, failure, as had already happened in the past and 
 Like all the realities that have crossed this phase they can 
 Stay to demonstrate what really happens in these groups.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Moreover a 
 group that becomes more and more shaky in the world market - 
 Even if it is not our business - it is evident that it does not have 
 effective possibilities of production recovery that can guarantee 
 the occupation of current workers and opens the way to a 
 downsizing, to one of his selling to the last master of duty who 
 It was more or less the same process that it brought Italsider a 
 Riva and subsequently to ArceloMittal and now ... they had another one.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All these things 
 In recent months they have undergone criticism and complaints, more or 
 less correct, more or less "screamed" by all 
 trade union organizations that are in that plant, as well as 
 From us, for reasons that can be well identified. But as if nothing 
 It was today all the unions go up to the chariot of the measures 
 of the government. And just the one who screamed, Palombella, is 
 Becoming the slave, the servant, the government's butler.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore you can 
 It is clear that the state of things in Ilva is a heavy aggravation 
 which falls above all on the workers. And in this heavy 
 aggravation, the only thing you see clearly is that masters, 
 government and unions are the same, they have the same program, 
 against which the workers protest can be raised to start 
 from the actual understanding of what is happening, from 
 understanding of the games that are in progress and by the strenuous defense of the 
 interests of the workers, a trenches necessary to defend the 
 interests of the territory, popular masses and thinking 
 actually to an environmentalization, to difficult reclamation e 
 complex - since we are in the capitalist system - but still 
 A battle to do.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today as never before 
 Workers' autonomy is the only solution, the reconstruction of the 
 strength of workers as strength
  <i>
   against
  </i>
  , do not force for, against the 
 logic of masters, government and unions that go in the direction of 
 deepen the crisis, do not solve the problems of the workers and the 
 popular masses, not only, but to make Ilva even a ring 
 of the next European election campaign.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In all this 
 The Slai Cobas for the class union represents the only item 
 alternative and on this it will be important, both in terms of factories 
 and cities both nationally, and this alternative item yes 
 feel strong and clear and find all the necessary understanding from 
 part of the class and combative trade union movement and of all 
 workers who are directly or indirectly involved in 
 This story.
