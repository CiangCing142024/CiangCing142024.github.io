    By the press release of the occupying assembly of the Manzoni classical high school
   </b>
</span>
</div>
<div style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: justify;">
<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
   Today (yesterday), February 27, 2024, the students and students of the Manzoni classical high school have occupied their school.
  </span>
</div>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   Faced with the current situation we found ourselves forced and forced to make this decision; that is, to occupy as it is the only response that can be given to the threats of Valditara, to the increasingly repressive measures of the Italian government,
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   to the repugnant accomplice silence and to the support of the western bloc to the massacre of the Palestinian people.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   Students and students are presented with the intellectual obligation to express themselves and not to remain deaf in the face of the cry of denunciation of an injustice declined in too many aspects of our lives.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   As regards the feelings of support to the Palestinian people who have prompted us to act in this way the spontaneous reflection is about the superficial and "part" way of the Italian media narration. These, that is, the main media, which are deeply corrupted by the same political power,
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   In fact, they make themselves thus proudly spokesperson for the rights in command with the agreed objective of creating the foundations of a system of silent consents around the capitalist and belligerent policies of the West. We believe that they deliberately omit and neglect important details of the current geopolitical crisis and the related participations of the co -responsible states, such as ours
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   which operates in all respects in defense of Israel: our decision not to speak with daily*was born from this observation.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   In particular, ours is an appeal, is a call to the hearts and minds of anyone who believes that the events that are marking the territory and the Palestinian people are not acceptable; of anyone who thinks that the silence of the western world, in particular of the Italian state, in front of the genocide of a people is even more unacceptable; of anyone who believes that repression has solidarity to an oppressed people is unbearable, first of all when this repression reaches students and students through "educational" feed.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Italian government, in fact, for two years now, in the name of the bitter criminal populism, used as a tool for political consensus and social discrimination, is implementing an increasingly repressive narrowness towards dissent:
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   It is a political line aimed at strengthening the authority of a governing class, culturally enslaved to the Euro-Atlantist powers, which implements policies, as internal as external, evidently contrary to the interests of the nation and young people, in the complete silence and accomplice of the so-called " opposition". Ours is no longer a democracy but a political system in which forces of

<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">

   The different extraction follows the same policies, assisted by a regime printing that tries in any means of orienting or distracting general opinion, in order to make the unconscious citizens of the street on which heterodirect policy has dangerously placed the same nation. occupant assembly that has decided to present this political action as an alternative to curricular teaching has as its objective:

<p>
  Nowadays, the tradition of opening the newspaper is already lost. “What to do? It's the new times, ”he thinks. But writing for a newspaper, the finding is kind of defeatist. It is still doubtful that people do not want to be informed. Social networks bombard information, true and false, and they are certainly visited frequently for this purpose.
 </p>
<p>
  We need to transform the realization into a question: what's wrong with the newspapers then? - These instruments that Machado de Assis, optimistic, but nothing naive, said to shake the aristocracies and illuminate a new time of social reforms.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the aristocracies of the time of Machado de Assis and before him certainly feared the newspaper. Almost coupled with the rise of the bourgeoisie, the free press made not a few nobles choke. In Brazil, they waged the wheels of progress while they could and the press could only settle, and still under strong persecution in 1808, if considered the press release of that time. In European countries where the bourgeois revolution took longer to happen, as in the case of Germany, real papal bulls were imposed by monarchical censorship to contain the spread of “dangerous ideas”, especially when it began to notice a new danger: the proletarian struggle . During the nineteenth century, the already hesitant bourgeoisie and tending to betrayal, began to give up the idea of freedom of the press. Bourgeois freedom has become too freedom for the desires of the bourgeoisie. Not a few times, the clandestine media were the only possible for democratic journalists, as in the case of our country's secret literary societies in the eighteenth century.
 </p>
<p>
  Machado also said: “Thank God, if there is anything to expect is that of proletarian intelligences, the tiny classes; of the superiors, no ”. Nothing naive, as I said. It was these superior classes that kidnapped the freedom of the press to themselves, denying it to any other class. It is like? The only way they know, with money.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, proletarian intelligences continued to flourish and began to reject this falsehood that is undergoing freedom of the press, subjected to the spurious and unhealthy needs of the bourgeoisie: inventing economic growth while the people starve, inventing high employment rates while The people have no work, justify a genocide etc. etc. etc. It was left to the point that in 2013 the broadcasters had to use uncharacterized device on the streets to cover the June demonstrations.
 </p>
<p>
  Yes, the tradition of opening the newspaper is lost to many and for now. But I do not think it is replaced by the television newspaper, that the pasta, when they watch, either seems to them a mockery or is mocked.
 </p>
<p>
  I also don't believe that it is the social networks that took their place, particularly. Social networks are generally used to find out precisely what would not appear in a newspaper. That this means that nothing genuine information is credited is just proof of the extension of investment to ideologically obscure the truth. Remembering Lincoln, however, it is not possible to deceive all people all the time.
 </p>
<p>
  Machado de Assis was right, even if not entirely. Freedom of the press scares the upper classes, the ruling classes, that is. But instead of “cutting the eagle wings that throws themselves into the infinity,” they decided to nose the eagle in the midst of their flight. Thus proved that the word, the
  <em>
   fiat
  </em>
  , it can only break free and become creative force when it is not subjected to the gross and perfidious tyranny of capital. Otherwise it remains attached to the fourth circle of hell next to Petruchio, where the condemned
  <em>
   collide with each other
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Some have no problem with this, and on the contrary, we face lies as well-fed pigs. Maybe for these it falls an even lower place, the
  <em>
   Malebols
  </em>
  , the circle of eternal damnation of counterfections.
 </p>
<p>
  Lenin, in 1917, sent a draft resolution on the freedom of the press to the provisional government of the proletarians and peasants, determining that the first measure to ensure press freedom was to create an “inquiry commission to investigate the ties between capital and. Periodicals, the sources of their funds and revenues, the list of their donors, the coverage of their deficits and all other aspects of the general journalistic business. ” Clearly dictatorial measure! Dictatorial for those who were bound by the misery of the people, dictatorial to those who sang the music of the tsar and imperialism to try to deceive the Russian workers and to launch them to the machine of grinding imperialist war people. For the people, he recommended that a fair part of the paper stock and print instruments were sent between groups of about 10,000 people.
 </p>
<p>
  Through this tour, I go beyond ax and say that not only the ruling classes fear freedom of the press and democracy. They fear that true freedom of the press is the suppression of his false freedom of the press. They fear above all that the awareness that true democracy is the suppression of its false, and bankrupt, democracy is elevated.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, the tradition of opening the newspaper may be lost, because the big (at least in size) newspapers, those who are press monopolies, have lost-and increasingly bury it under the rubble of gold-coated chimerers, but crowded with Blood - Any moral authority over the masses. I still remember when, a child, I heard at Globo that he uses it was fighting Taliban's terrorism in Afghanistan and that seemed undeniable truth. Today, some councilman has been said to have a hole in a country town, the stressed interlocutor himself makes the fact contestable.
 </p>
<p>
  Defending a free and democratic press, supporting it and disseminating it is not, however, fighting the current of time, but to ensure that “the worker who withdraws at home, fatigued by the daily work, will find it next to Bread of the body, that bread of spirit, social host of public communion, ”as our greatest writer said. What the spirit of the worker rejects is the bonus bread that they want, the strength, push him.
 </p>
<p>
  I believe, therefore, at the end of the question of the death of this great tradition of opening the newspaper in the free and democratic press. She, who was born and growing initially almost coupled to the rise of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois revolutions, not very different from factories, is truly tied to the grand collective destiny of humanity, to the revolutionary destiny of humanity.

  Thousands of people today flooded the main streets of Chania. Strike workers, students, students, farmers, workers' unions, bodies and colleges of the city have been demonstrating today against the unstoppable and ever -escalating system attack on a series of youth - workers - people. The right to free education and care, the right to permanent and stable work with human working conditions and free trade union activity, the right to decent living and income that covers the cost of living, the right to cheap and safe transportation of the people, the right In peace and friendship with the surrounding peoples and so many, all of them are targeted and questioned or neglected by the policies applied.

  At the same time, however, there are important struggles of society departments that suffocate under the burden of the new round of attack on their rights but stand up against anti -populist politics. Student's big battle against the private universities bill, farmers' struggles against the government-EU anti-graduation policy, the Chaniots' struggle to defend their access to free care and a series of private and public workers' races show That there are significant resistance that proves that despite the sophisticated attack promoted, the government and the system as a whole is not omnipotent.

  This promising kinematic upheaval of the period and the legacy of previous magnificent youth mobilizations for the horrific crime in Tempi was also reflected in today's strike rally and march in our city. Against the "loud" kinematic inaction of trade unions such as GSEE, against the announcement of "rifles" trade unions such as ADEDY to get out of the obligation and against the logical struggles and their assignments to all PAME experts to all of PAME, against They meet the struggling pieces on a common front, people - workers - youth have shown today that we do not bend our heads, we will not stay on the sidelines, the struggles of all of us are fair and can win!

  The bloc of the initiative resistance framed with a significant number of competitors gave his slogans to be heard, trying to highlight the need to strengthen resistance to the policy that crushes workers, youth and the people as a whole. In the previous days of the strike, interventions have been made with notices and discussions in the hospital, in workplaces, public services, unions. So the positive message of today's strike rally imposes the strength of efforts to find all the layered strata of this anti -populist policy on a common front of struggle for resistance to attack and claiming rights!

<strong>
   Writing Note:
  </strong>
  We reproduce below an article from the portal The Red Herald (
  <em>
   The Red Herald
  </em>
  ) About the two years completed since the beginning of the Ukraine War of Aggression.
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
  On February 24 this year, the total war of aggression against Ukraine by Russian imperialism marks its second anniversary. This unfair war generated hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded and millions of displaced, caused misery and pain to all the Ukrainian people.
 </p>
<p>
  Thanks to the heroic defense of his homeland by the people of Ukraine, despite the traitorous national regime led by the Zelensky Yankee, the Russian aggressor has not been able to fulfill his maximum war goals.
 </p>
<p>
  It is fair and correct to reaffirm what the International Communist League (LCI) issued a year ago:
  <em>
   “The main contradiction is that among Ukraine, a country oppressed by imperialism, and Russia, an imperialist country. Regardless of the class character of the Ukrainian regime and its service to the interests of other imperialist powers, especially from Yankee superpower, any confusion over this point leads to Ukraine to its right to independence and national sovereignty and therefore at least indirectly, support the interests of Russian imperialism ”,
  </em>
  as well as
  <em>
   "The long-term plan of the Yankee to surround and ultimately defeat their only nuclear equivalent and the Russian counter-menus to resume lost positions, is the key factor that leads to war."
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  It is particularly noteworthy, and it was also proved correct, which was then written:
  <em>
   “Zelensky's regime is in a sharp contradiction with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian people, trafficking with their fair patriotic feelings, applies absolute centralism and there are no democratic rights, whatever they may be, to the people. Opinion, meeting, and organization rights are suppressed by draconian and chauvinist repression and the regime depends on fascist military formations open to crush all expressions of popular discontent. Sabota the independent armed resistance of the people by relying on weapons, eagerly provided by NATO led by the Yankee, fearing the armed people who is the only one who really defends the nation
  </em>
  “.
 </p>
<p>
  This is an important fact. Because today it is clear and obvious that the main reason Zelensky's regime is unable to defeat the Russian imperialist aggression - despite all the heroic sacrifices of the Ukrainian people - it is because these homeland traitors trust imperialism, especially yankeeper, and Not in the masses.
 </p>
<p>
  This is expressed, among many other things, in the case of the fall of Avdiivka, a small town in the Donetsk region. A bitter tragedy, as these wars write them.
  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/ukrainian-avdiivka-soldiers-messages-intl/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   As reported by the press
  </a>
  The soldiers parked there made desperate attempts to escape the ruins of the city. One of them wrote:
  <em>
   “It was just a matter of survival. The road to Avdiivka is full of Ukrainian corpses. ”
  </em>
  A commander informed the radio that the injured would not be evacuated. The men were left behind to be executed by the Russian invaders. In this way, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have made the decision to abandon the city, surrendering to Russia their most significant victory since captured the city of Bakhmut last year.
  <em>
   “The ability to save our people is the most important task for us,”
  </em>
  said Zelensky with the greatest cynicism at the Munich security conference. The New York Times analyzed:
  <em>
   “Avdiivka's capture for Russia is a strategic and symbolic coup for the military of Ukraine. Avdiivka was a stronghold of Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region, protecting several important Ukrainian military positions to the west and placing the neighboring city of Russia -controlled Donetsk under constant threat ”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  We can see that the current tendency is that Russian imperialism is on its way to slowly realizing its minimum war objectives. Maps published by the BBC show this clearly:

  Also internally Russian imperialism is advancing. The new head of the Wagner mercenaries, Anton Yelizarov, recently said the restructuring of the organization: “We are building a camp so that the new units that will be formed - which will become part of the Russian National Guard Volunteer body (Rosgvardiya) - may arrive and establish yourself. ” This so -called “Cossaco camp” would be “almost certainly” based on the city of Rostov, in southern Russia,

  . This development finally buries all the western speculation and dreams of a military coup against Putin. Navalny's death also serves, as well as the decision of the courts that Boris Nadezhdin is prevented from participating in the next elections scheduled for March 15-17 or the settlement of a deserter pilot in Spain.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not only militarily that Russian imperialism is gaining ground. Economically,
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/russia-oil-india-shadow-fleet-cmd-intl/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   as reported by CNN
  </a>
  , Russia is entering its third year of war in Ukraine with an unprecedented amount of money in government coffers, reinforced by a record of $ 37 billion in gross oil sales to India by 2023. Thus, India increases your raw Russian oil purchases. Oil in more than 13 times its values prior to war, a trade not subject to sanctions and since then totally legal. Russia's federal revenues fired to a $ 320 billion record by 2023 and are expected to increase further. About a third of money is spent on the war in Ukraine.
 </p>
<p>
  Also in international politics Russian imperialism is still a force with which it should be calculated, as shown by the last proposal of a meeting of all Palestinian factions in Moscow, in order to create a certain national unit, especially among the two largest factions , Fatah and Hamas,
  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-02-18-24/h_d7fe8b0d1648652842b5f5daa65928c1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  on February 18.
 </p>
<p>
  Under these impressions it is necessary to reaffirm the tasks we have ahead, defined by LCI in February last year:
  <em>
   “We must also do everything we can to promote the friendship of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. Two people who were once united as one in the great Soviet union under the red flag with the scythe and the hammer of Lenin and Stalin are now pushed against each other on the battlefield due to the imperialist's intrigues. Communist formation, the revolutionaries and all the consequent anti-imperialists, have a particular responsibility to increase propaganda against the imperialist war of Russia, raising their struggle to new levels against the imperialist state and their war of aggression, by all means within your reach. disposition, also fighting against the imperialist war and the sending of weapons in the respective imperialist countries ”.

<p>
   Fight and Class Brothers, receive a hot and combative greeting on this World Recycle Day.
  </p>
<p>
   The revolutionary workers, the communists, are not oblivious to their problems and therefore we become present in this new day of struggle, hosting their call to overcome fear, indifference and laziness because the livelihood of families is at risk.
  </p>
<p>
   We support their demands to the National Government because they are fair and guarantee of the protection and permanence of the true popular recyclers ex officio.
  </p>
<p>
   We reject the maneuvers of the cleaning companies and the Superintendency to not pay them what they have already worked and constitutes a violation of the law conquered in the historical struggles of the recycler.
  </p>
<p>
   We join their complaint rejecting those who intend to supplant true recyclers and their organizations with the claim to displace them from the trade.
  </p>
<p>
   We support their demand for exclusivity for ex officio recycling organizations as natural providers, in compliance with amparo orders to the vital minimum, the permanence in the trade and the recognition of the social, environmental and economic contributions of the guild to the country for more than 80 years of exercise.
  </p>
<p>
   We cannot allow the greed of a few ricachones to move from the trade to thousands of families who for years have not hesitated to put their hands in the trash to get sustenance, contributing with their effort and sacrifice to improve society and the environment. As you just say: Recycling without recyclers, it's garbage!
  </p>
<p>
   In addition to this, we are here with you and with you to invite you to join the preparation of the popular assemblies that collect the demands of the entire working people and conquer them with the mobilization and the fight in the streets, and even with a new National unemployment, given the refusal of the rich exploiters and laziness who refuse to improve the conditions of existence of those who support society with their work and now intend to sink the small reforms proposed by the current government, also threatening to knock down the president.
  </p>
<p>
   You have been and remain an example of struggle and testify that the claims are conquered with the fight and with the fight they defend themselves.
  </p>
<p>
   There is no other companions, because the exploiting parasitic classes that dominate the world, are not able to solve the big and serious problems that society faces and that has created the system they defend; On the contrary, they continue to overcome the workers, stripping the poor of the city and the field of their subsistence means, and as if that were not enough they continue to destroy the environment, invading countries, massacing villages, displacing millions and preparing a New World War.
  </p>
<p>
   Go ahead, that the battles of now forge the unity and will of the working people preparing it to take the reins of the management of the society.
  </p>
<p>
   Go ahead, that the future belongs to those who hold society with their work.
  </p>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   Long live the National Recycling Minga!
   <br>
   Go ahead with popular assemblies!
   <br>
   A single town, a single fight!
  </br></br></h5>

  The mass demonstration in Alexandroupolis was completed with a massive of about 250 people, while the Student Associations of Pedagogy and Kindergarten, the Alex/Polis Music School, ELME, NT. of ADEDY, Labor Associations, Colleges and Mass Bodies, the Convention on Old Cemetery, etc.
 </p>
<p>
  The racing moves have formed their own blocs, in which they tried through their slogans to highlight that the policy of the murdered system, which abolishes rights and conquests, which poor and sows war and poverty, can only be answered through one audience. Front of youth fight with workers, farmers, teachers, the people in total.
 </p>
<p>
  It was a special time when farmers arrived at the rally, who greeted the strike. This union of pieces of the people affected by the policies of the system was moving and showed the dynamics it hides within it. It turns out that we need other such strikes and demonstrations, because in the end the only way out for the people is that of the struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  We continue by inviting the General Assembly of the Medical Students' Association on Thursday 29/2 at 14:00 at Amph. Dragana!

  With a great deal of participation in the strike (in the public sector) and even greater participation in the strike and demonstration, workers, students and students have expressed their racing moods against the anti -populist policy of the system and the government. The anger for the crime of Tempi met with the indignation and anger of people and youth for poverty, accuracy, poverty, class attack on education, watering the right to care, and became a massive river seeking the terms to convert the terms in a struggle for resistance and claim.
 </p>
<p>
  The rally was attended by the student club, students with an organized bloc, the local ADEDY (only name), the Associations of Teachers and Professors, Private Employees, Judicial Officers and Hospital with a massive and dynamic block.
 </p>
<p>
  Apart from the great mass of the course, it should be noted the massive participation of the student world, which has long been on the path of the race and who had recently shown significant signs of fatigue and the constituted presence of students mainly of the 2nd High School. At this school, after the initiative of fighters and pupils, the issue was first discussed at the 15 -member and then at the General Assembly and decided to participate in the rally, with a separate block, which eventually gathered over a hundred students. It is a serious legacy, especially in a half -frontal attack and the forthcoming submission of the National Bachelor's Billiture bill.

 Mass strike rally took place today (28.2) in Corinth with hundreds demonstrating in the city center! The gathering began at the Labor Center following speeches by A. and B ELME Corinthia, the Corinthian Prefecture of Private Employees, and the Mourikis Workers' Union. Then there was a march to the old Corinth Railway. The class was intervened by the classroom by distributing the newspaper and its pregnancy.

  Athens was flooded. Thousands of strikers and young people took to the streets demonstrating their anger against the barbaric, murderous, anti -populist and anti -labor policy. And this, despite the absence of a strike from the GSEE workers (who continue the subversive for their labor movement), but also against the forces of consensus and submission to "get out of the obligation" and preach and preach it. the end of the matches.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  It was clear that the rage over the daily and escalating anti-labor and anti-populist attack is overflowing: the demolition of rights, the unprecedented precision, the attack on the future of the youth itself, in the crusader measures for farmers.
 </p>
<p>
  Especially when he coincided with the one-year completion of the massive state-of-state murder in Tempi, and the obvious operation of the concealment of the responsibilities of this rotten system and its managers. It was clear from the previous days that this would give even greater boost to the struggles expressed on the streets for weeks by students and farmers, and despite the rush of farmers to close (just a day earlier!) The agricultural mobilizations. And it was also clear that this mass "meeting" of these moods on the street did not fit into the character of the memorial that the forces of submission wanted to mobilize. Nor should it be disoriented behind the alleged "clarification" operation of the causes and those responsible through examinations and other state committees and bodies. Because the people are well aware that the key responsible for this crime is the bourgeois state itself and the policy of its governments. Policy that exploits, oppresses and murders!
 </p>
<p>
  Very massively, with the pulse of the classrooms and racing movements, the racing movements of teachers and the student resistance, promoting slogans of claiming labor rights, defending strikes and class union, defense of your youth struggles, but also solidarity with the fighting Palestinian people. There were a few times that these two composed blocks were applauded from the surrounding world.
 </p>
<p>
  The presence of the repressive forces, especially around the blocks that gathered in Havtia is very intense. Indeed, shortly before the end of the demonstration, they were attacking the concentrated and casting chemicals, which they did a little earlier without achieving the dissolution of the demonstration.
 </p>
<p>
  Today's strike rally can and should be boosted to the further establishment of the popular and labor movement, to continue the struggles of people and youth. The fact that government provocation continues with the submission of the bill on private universities shows that there is no room for repetition.

   They are not going to leave anything upright! The attack on the rights and conquests of the people is proceeding on increasingly barbaric terms everyday! In this context, basic rights are disputed! Every day dozens of people lose their homes for a few thousand euros. Decades have been annihilating in a few moments with prosecutors and police applying the checks of funds and banks. Diabs that have come with the Memorandum commitments that are intended to hit even the right to popular home!
   <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The blow to the right to popular home is part of a more comprehensive attack on our rights:
  </div>
<div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
     Every day we see our salaries ending in the middle of the month, having to choose whether to pay our rent or bills, chase their "offers" to find out which super market will rich the most!
    </li>
<li>
     At the same time, the children of the people are flying out of education, putting triple (!) Panhellenic in every year of the Lyceum and set up private universities to put a tombstone in public and free education!
    </li>
<li>
     They have regularly made the Middle Ages, establishing 10 hours, elastic work, short conventions and employer arbitrariness.
    </li>
<li>
     They hit our right to trade unionism by trying to get unlawful unions and strikes!
    </li>
<li>
     They are crushed by crumbs while they have lost their lives!
    </li>
<li>
     They cement and drown every corner of green in our neighborhoods to build concrete murmurs
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
   This situation must be overturned! Not with "tricks" and easy "solutions". The movements and initiatives made to block the auctions when done are in the right direction! They show that no matter how much they try, the people do not indifferent when they see their neighbor flying on the road! This is also revealed by the rage of the government that drowns in chemicals and woods by those who choose to lift their heads and defend the popular home! However, it is a fact that hundreds of first home auctions are held daily (50,000 are expected in 2024!) Where the movement cannot respond only by mobilizations on the day of exits. It is noteworthy that houses that are made of evictions have already come into the hands of the banks/funds for months. The only way to give a substantial answer is to set up a movement, beyond the blockages of outsourcing, it will fight to overthrow all the mnemonic laws that have released the auctions!
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   We have to take the situation in our hands! We need to become our neighborhoods of struggles and resistance! Let's say no to the black life they are preparing! Let us not accept that we will work until the final fall for a dry -scale that is not enough to meet our basic needs. That we will be struggling when the electricity bills will come and think about whether we will light up or put a "double sweaters" as they are provocatively we are told. That we will accept that the houses of the people will grab the crows of the funds and the banks seeing the hardships of a life disappear in one day. Only on the way of the movement can we find our right! Collectively and organized because we can only live with struggles!

    The last study of INPS also confirms the difference in treatment of women who work
   </b>
   In Italy from "young workers to pensioners" as reported an article of the Republic of 22 February last, denying once again, with data and forcefully, Meloni's propaganda shouted by the electoral stages, and not only for the wage difference and pensions , but also for the number of women at work since
   <b>
    Among unemployed and inactive there are several million unemployed women.
   </b>
</p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   As for the so -called
   <i>
    gender pay gap
   </i>
   , namely the difference in pay, you arrive with regard to pensions at 40 billion!
  </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   "In 2022 322 billion in pensions and welfare services were paid by INPS.
   <b>
    141 billion went to women
   </b>
   .
   <b>
    To men 180 billion
   </b>
   . With a difference of almost 40 billion. This is despite average, women are the owners of more than one pension, as happens when reversibility is. AND
   <b>
    Although the retirees are more numerous than retirees: 8.3 million against 7.8.
   </b>
   Women are 52% but take 44%.
  </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   The causes, according to the study, but that women live daily on their skin, are "intermittent careers, chopped by maternity and care needs. Fixed-term and part-time contracts, chosen or mostly forced. But also a structural difference in the hourly salary between men and women (horizontal segregation). Also in the public administration. And everywhere at the highest levels, those of the management, to whom women arrive in a few (vertical segregation). " All this ends "on the defendants' counter".
  </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   “Il
   <i>
    gender gap
   </i>
   Start from work. - continues the newspaper - Also in 2022, the annual salary gap between women and men in the private sector was on average 6 thousand euros per year: 17,300 euros account 24,500 euros per year, 97 euros against 106 euros per day. A 40% difference which, although calculated as the INPS does with the same conditions (age, contracts, hours worked), never resets and reaches a 12-13% stable.
  </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   Almost half of Italian women work in part-time (47.7%) against less than a fifth of men (17.4%). The paid days in one year to women are 221 against 234 of men. And this explains a lot about the gaps. "
  </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   And the public sector is not even saved, says the journalist, "considered safe and sheltered from inequalities. Instead no. " Because: "The salary gap, albeit lower than the private individual, exists: 5,200 euros per year, 15-20 euros per day: 28,400 euros against 33,600 euros per year, 95 euros against 114 euros per day. The gap is created from the growing appeal in the PA of short contracts, especially in school and health, where the presence of women is relevant. Even the part-time, certainly less present than in the private, concerns women twice the men (6% against 3%). Two thirds of all public workers are women. "
  </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   “There is no escape even at home. Parental leave is asked for 80% by women. And the gap with his companions is very large, especially up to the three years of his son. The fathers, when they ask, are mostly workers from large companies and full -time. While 46% of applicant and part-time mothers.
   <b>
    Women penalized at work, in the paycheck, at home and then retired
   </b>
   . Not a nice see. " But it is clear that this study is limited to direct or deferred salary (pensions) and not to
   <i>
<b>
     working conditions
    </b>
</i>
<i>
    .
   </i>
</p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm;">
   Therefore when the newspaper of the Agnelli puts "on the defendants' bench ... intermittent careers, broken by maternity and care needs. Fixed-term contracts and part-time, chosen or mostly forced "tries to give an" aseptic "," objective "framework of the state of affairs, as if all this did not depend on the capitalist-imperialist exploitation system, a system that must be reversed by a political and social revolution.

    Mr. Minister of Justice Nordio we want to meet her

<div class="post-body entry-content" id="post-body-3427954436847406752" itemprop="description articleBody" style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif;  line-height: 1.4; position: relative; width: 588px;">
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    We worked for months to write the bill for the introduction of the crime of murder at work and serious and very serious injuries and to collect, with the decisive contribution of the USB, tens of thousands of signatures in the squares, factories, in construction sites , among ordinary people.
   </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    We found the support of trade union, political, intellectuals and people of entertainment and art, we made this proposal the only proposal in the field to try to stop the exploitation of workers, the precariousness, the system of contracts that are at the basis of daily slaughter in the workplace.
   </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    We also inspired each other precisely the introduction of the road and nautical murder. It seemed to us that there could be no valid reason, in the face of thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of mutilated and disabled every year on the workplace to adopt the same determination also towards the murders in the workplace. A strong deterrence, preparing a certainty of the penalty and an adequate penalty, if an adequate penalty can exist for those who kill in the name of profit; Opening to new and more incisive powers for workers' representatives for safety, providing for an urgent procedure in the discussion of trade union complaints on the failure to comply with the rules on safeguarding health and safety. Obliging companies to prepare the mandatory risk assessment documents so that they were no longer just a piece of paper to be shown to inspectors regardless of their content.
   </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    His laconic and lapidary response to all this is hasty and inadmissible for us. What would have happened to the workers of the Esselunga construction site if one day they had suddenly decided to stop and go out on the road by stopping the circulation to denounce the serious shortcomings in compliance with the protection of health on their workplace and perhaps also the black work and the absurdity of the Contract system? They would have risked very high penis, up to six years of imprisonment, thanks to the reintroduction of the road block crime. A reintroduction aimed at making you desist from making road blocks or occupations of companies who had in mind to protest for working conditions, against layoffs, in favor of the environment ...
   </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    Luana D'Orazio died because an warpiece to which she had intentionally removed a protection. The ongoing trial is outlining the classic conclusion, negligible condemnation thanks to the plea bargain, no effectiveness of the sentence.
   </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    Like Luana many and many others do not see in justice the determination to act to repress behaviors dictated by the thirst for earnings and by the contempt for the health and life of workers. Does the owner of that factory, the company that managed the Florence site, would have operated in the same way in the face of the prediction of penis adequate to the severity of the facts?
   </p>
<p style="background: transparent; line-height: 17.0775px; margin-bottom: 0.25cm; text-align: justify;">
    Mr. Minister we ask you to meet, even just to tell you that we do not intend to get back and that we will continue our battle in the name of Luana and all the thousands of workers and workers murdered in the workplace and which we ask at least that justice listens to.

  Like the example of the lamina that in 2019 negotiated despite the fact that there were no lack of safety systems, as if it were enough to monetize by advising that the massacres are a collateral damage to be taken into account. Increase an atmosphere in which the masters feel unpunished and free to kill also thanks to the fascist government that focuses on the company, the defense of the national interest or the profits: blood worker wealth of the owners.

  After compensating the families of the victims and INAIL for a total of about 4.5 million euros, Roberto Sanmarchi, the owner of the Lamina, the Milanese metallurgical company where four workers died on 16 January 2018 due to an escape Argon gas in the tank of an oven. This was decided by the Milan Gup Manuela Scudieri, accepting the request of the prosecutor and lawyers Roberto Nicolosi Petringa and Elena Benedetti. The accusation was manslaughter.
 </p>
<p>

   The investigation, coordinated by the additional Sicilian Tiziana and the prosecutors Gaetano Ruta and Letizia Mocciaro, had highlighted a series of flaws in the factory safety systems, highlighted by a complex technical advice. It had been ascertained that in the factory, in fact, there were no "safety procedures on the use of the alarm control unit of the oxygen level"

  And "on the management of the silent function" of the alarm itself that played in the morning and was probably deactivated by one of the four workers, who then went into the oven tank and died one after the other.

   Fiom Milano: “We await the final outcome of the trial, but let's say as of now that a possible plea bargain is not acceptable because it would affirm the principle according to which in the face of the death of workers, compensation is sufficient to reduce the responsibilities of those who have determined so dramatic consequences ".

<p>
   On February 14 in the city of Bucaramanga, the General Assembly of the Committee for the Defense of Water and the Páramo de Santurbán was held, a space where various environmental, social and political organizations attended.
   <em>
    Workers Revolution
   </em>
   She was formally invited to the event.
  </p>
<p>
   While the National Government of the Historical Pact has stated that it will not allow megaminería in the Páramo, the Mine Juvenal Governor Herrera has said to have "responsible." Therefore, the Páramo ecosystem is still in danger of exploitation, hence the importance of the assembly to address the matter again and establish a road map to follow.
  </p>
<p>
   This important assembly space was not carried out for 4 years, partly by the pandemic. The attendees, approximately 100 people were arriving at the headquarters of the Sintraemsdes Union. The Assembly began with exhibitions on the current situation of the Santurbán Páramo, the environmental and social impact that would mean its exploitation, the legal aspect of the mining issue, the mobilization and legal actions undertaken by the Committee in Defense of the Páramo, and then They were able to listen to the various interventions of different environmental processes that develop struggles in different areas of Santander, coming with the proposal to form a coordination of the struggles for the defense of the environment throughout the department. At the end of the event, the attendees expressed their proposals on the mobilization actions that they intend to organize this year to continue with the struggle for the defense of water, the moor and life itself in the region.
  </p>
<p>
   The call that we make the revolutionaries is to begin to promote popular assemblies so that all the problems that afflict the Santander people are solved with a unique sheet that must be conquered with the method of organization and direct struggle; One of the demands that must be raised is the expulsion of the Mineasa Multinational and Aris Mining of the region, the reform of the Mining Code, the formalization of small miners and conditions for their transit to another type of economy.
  </p>
<p>
   Likewise, with the conviction to resolve the contradiction between nature and capital, it is only possible to end the deepest cause: private property, we call to defend life, flora, fauna, and the very existence of planet Earth, by medium of the direct and revolutionary struggle of the organized masses.

<p>
  Former Army Land Operations Command Chief General Estevam Theophilo Gaspar de Oliveira revealed that he met with Jair Bolsonaro in December 2022 by order of the then Army Commander Freire Gomes. The statement was given in a statement to the Federal Police on February 23 and revealed by journalist Bela Megale on 29/02. In addition to pointing to the beginning of “Save Who Can” through the barrack in the barracks, the revelation goes against what Freire Gomes had preached here. The former commander has insisted that he did not participate in the coup articulation and even played against the movement.
 </p>
<p>
  This meeting took place on December 9, 2022, at the Dawn Palace, and was discussed the open institutional break to culminate the ongoing military coup, with the presentation of the so -called “scoring draft”. The information of the meeting was revealed in awarded denunciation with the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mauro Cid reserve. According to messages found on the same military cell phone, Theophilo would have, at the meeting, agreed to board the execution of the coup. If the culmination of the coup had been consolidated, Estevam would have been responsible for triggering and commanding the reactionary army special forces, the “
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  for that".
 </p>
<p>
  Theophilo's departure occurred a day after Jair Bolsonaro, Augusto Heleno, Braga Netto and other prominent military personnel to the Federal Police headquarters in Brasilia to give testimony. Everyone was silent at the time.
 </p>
<p>
  It was thus steering the standard and joined Mauro Cid on the list of those who will open the game, even partially, about the coup joint. The general's only revelation released to the press so far, in a five-hour statement, has served to incriminate former commander Freire Gomes again.
 </p>
<p>
  Gomes, who in a meeting with Bolsonaro said he would not participate in the open institutional rupture, has been trying in recent weeks to carry on the version that "articulated against the coup." So far, no evidence has been presented, and the whole scenario continues to point out for its omission and prevarication against the scammer's coup joint of his high command colleagues.
 </p>
<p>
  Now, with the new revelation, at the best of the hypotheses for Gomes, he will be regarded as another general of the military summit which, in recent years, has consented to the increasingly active intervention of the reactionary armed forces in national political life (in models From a silent military coup as designed by the military right), and which in 2022 completely omitted against the open blow planned by its consorts. At the worst, it is once again regarded as one of the articulators of the far-right coup plot.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also the question of what will be the next reactionary military who will seek to deliver another, superior or lower, to try to save his own skin, thus aggravating the military crisis and further revealing the role of the military summit in the agitation and articulation of the blow. Cid has gone, and Theophilo joined him. What will be the next friendly fire?

<p>
  Friday 8.3 at 5:00 pm, Senate Square
 </p>
<p>
  Restriction of strike rights, export-driven labor market model and complication of part-time work-the government's policy of misery led by Petteri Orpo is strongly focused on women and female-dominated sectors. The aim of the government's planned export -driven wage model is to change the legislation so that the percentage of wage increases in the export sectors would set the roof for wage increases in other sectors. If implemented, the reform will leave the nurses and many other underpaid female -dominated sectors in the eternal payroll. We demand the end of all plans for the export-driven labor market model and the restriction of strike rights and a significant financial investment in renewable work.
 </p>
<p>
  The cuts in vital support services and social security make one of the most dangerous countries for women in Europe. One in three women living in Finland has experienced physical violence, threat of physical violence or sexual violence, and every other woman has experienced mental violence in a relationship. International human rights bodies have repeatedly criticized Finland for not being effectively rejected by violence against women. We require additional funding to create a shelter network and the low -threshold support services that have experienced intimate partner violence, which are currently strongly focused on the third sector due to the scarcity of funding.
 </p>
<p>
  The government will also continue to support Israel, which is currently carrying out the Palestinian genocide, and Turkey, which opposes Kurdish. The genocide in Gaza, especially in Gaza, affects women who are struggling with their lives, who, in addition to bombing and approximate execution, have sexual violence in completely non-viable conditions where it is impossible to access normal menstrual and hygiene supplies. At the same time, Turkey, who has been bombing a feminist revolution in Rojava, is allowed to continue its operations as its NATO partners follow. The Finnish government will remain silent in both cases, with more of its trading partners, for which it purchases and sells weapons and defense equipment. We require the suspension of these stores and the immediate termination of warfare.
 </p>
<p>
  We will meet at the Senate Square at 5:00 pm and go to 5:30 pm through Aleksanterinkatu and Mannerheimintie to Narinkkatori.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration is organized by Aurora Helsinki, the Left Youth of Helsinki, the Kurdish Democratic Community Center NCDK and Riseup4rojava Finland.
 </p>
<p>
  Aurora Helsinki and the Varis Network will be organizing after the demonstration at 20:00

  About the battles in the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood, in the city of Gaza, and the withdrawal of the Zionist's Brigade of Sionistas from the track.
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
  The Israeli army radio has announced that the army has removed the Brigade of Gaza Strip parachuters and is replacing it with other forces.
 </p>
<p>
  The decision was made after fierce battles in Khan Yunis, where Palestinian resistance is once again recovering the initiative.
 </p>
<p>
  The skydivers have been parked in the Khan Yunis area for almost three months.
 </p>
<p>
  "Neither the radio nor the army provided details about the number and equipment of the Parachute Brigade, which left Gaza," said Al-Jazeera.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  A Batalha de Zaytoun
 </h4>
<p>
  A similar scenario is repeating itself in Zaytoun, northern Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  "The al-Qassam brigades are controlling the battles in the Zaytoun neighborhood, inflicting losses to the occupation," said Al-Jazeera.
 </p>
<p>
  In turn, the Israeli army said its soldiers continued military operations in Zaytoun, allegedly destroying openings of tunnels and finding weapons that belonged to resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, an important source of the al-Qassam brigades, the Military Wing of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas, said Al-Qassam is managing the battle in the Zaytoun neighborhood with all the strength and skill.
 </p>
<p>
  The source said the resistance inflicted heavy losses to the Israeli army in terms of military, official and soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  The main source, which spoke to Al-Jazeera, added that the battle in the area of Zaytoun is being led based on information and intelligence documents that al-Qassam obtained from the Israeli army.
 </p>
<p>
  "The analysis of the documents they obtained allowed the al-Qassa brigades to identify the goals and expected routes of the new occupation operation in the Zaytoun neighborhood," the source said.
 </p>
<p>
  The source also "confirmed that the losses of the occupation in the Zaytoun neighborhood are great and that the battle is still underway."
 </p>
<p>
  Since the beginning of the devastating Israeli war against Gaza, on October 7, 582 Israeli officials and soldiers have been killed, including 242 in land operations that have been underway since October 27, and wounds about 3,000 officers and soldiers, according to the announced data.
 </p>
<p>
  Israel does not recognize their real losses in the battles in the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently on trial before the International Court of Justice for Genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waging a devastating war in Gaza since October 7.

  According to the Ministry of Health of Gaza, 30,035 Palestinians were killed and 70,457 were injured in the continuous genocide of Israel in Gaza, which began on October 7.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, at least 7,000 people are missing, supposedly killed under the rubble of their homes throughout the track.
 </p>
<p>
  Palestinian and international organizations say most of those dead and injured are women and children.
 </p>
<p>
  Israeli aggression also resulted in the forced displacement of nearly two million people from all over Gaza, and the vast majority of displaced people were forced to go to the city of Rafah, in the south, densely populated, near the border with Egypt - In what has become the largest mass exodus in Palestine since Nakba of 1948.
 </p>
<p>
  Israel states that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-AQSA Flood Operation on October 7. The Israeli press has published reports that suggest that many Israelis were killed that day for "friendly fire."

    Military police murdered 9 people, invaded houses, prohibited the circulation of residents, and caused the closure of schools and health clinics during a mega -operation that reached all the slums of the German and Penha complexes in the north of Rio de Janeiro. Adjacent communities such as Flexal, Train, Queen Engenho, Small, Squeeze, Ipase, Guaporé and Quitungo were also targeted. In the South Zone and West Zone, the Cidade de Deus and Rocinha slums were surrounded by police. Another megaoperation also took the Maré Complex, executed by Civil Police police. The action counts as another slaughter mega operation by Governor Claudio Castro during his term of office in Rio de Janeiro, with logistical, financial and political support from the federal government.

     As a result of the invasion, 20.5 thousand students from municipal schools were left without class. In the Penha Complex, there were 16 municipal schools that suspended classes. They serve 4,800 students. In German, 20 municipal units ceased to work due to megaoperation, violating the right to learn 7.1 thousand students. At Maré, where the Civil Police Special Resources Coordination (Core) undertakes the megaoperation, 24 schools that serve 8.1 thousand students closed. Finally, at Morro do Trem, 342 students from 2 schools could not study.

     Health units also had to stop attending patients today. In German, the Family Clinic (CF) Zilda Arns interrupted the operation, while in Penha the Aloysio Augusto Family Clinic suspended home visits. Already at Maré, CF Jeremias Moraes da Silva also interrupted the operation in the morning, and CF Diniz Batista dos Santos interrupted visits to the houses of residents.

     Today's operations add to the extensive operations list promoted by Governor Claudio Castro against Rio de Janeiro's favelas. So far, Castro is already responsible for 3 of the 5 largest slaughter in the history of RJ. Last year, Governor Genocida received investments from hundreds of millions of reais from the Federal Government to buy new equipment for the police. Castro was also praised by Lula in rallies organized in Rio de Janeiro last year.

  I play the clothes of the contortion that must "think" on the defeat 
 electoral in Sardinia, passed immediately afterwards to boast of the good result of the 
 government government btp value.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  But what is it actually? The government, to collect 
 money with so -called small savers, has decided to issue a title of 
 Was called BTP value, which can be purchased for a minimum cut of 1000 
 euro, and which gives the right to an interest (miserable in reality).
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Until now the government has collected just over 16 
 billions ...
  <b>
   on which he will have to pay the interest that will be added to those 
 Approximately 100 billion of interests per year for public debt

  .
  <o:p>

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  We do not enter into the merits for now who is this “small 
 savers ", who are the" families "to whom Meloni turns ... Let's say that 
 Also in this case Meloni takes advantage of it to make nationalist propaganda.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  And in fact, looking at the room, he signed towards the "saver" 
 Speaking of "trust" (given the outcome of the elections in Sardinia!): "The 
 I interpret as a sign of trust by citizens and savers ", 
 The Prime Minister commented (according to https://it.investing.com)- 
 who appreciated the "response to a strategy with which
  <b>
   we want

 Italians ".
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  How much is the Italian public debt? About
  <b>
   3

  ! How much did Meloni collected with this operation?
  <b>
   16 
 Billion
  </b>
  .
  <b>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  This is the substance of the current problem. "It's possible 
 report the Italian public debt in the hands of the Italians "? Meloni if 
 You care about logic! “This, he concluded,“ allows us from a part of giving 
 to citizens a tool to secure savings and on the other of 
 be more masters of our destiny because when your public debt is 
 In your hands you are less subjected to external pressures ".
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  First: as the statistics on current accounts and i 
 deposits still in banks the problem is not at all “to secure i 
 You save ”lending them to the state, it has nothing to do with it! The request for
  <b>
   remove

  their money and enter them in 
 Italian production system is above all of the Italian masters who repeat it many 
 times especially from the columns of the Sole 24 Ore!

  Second: the public debt that Meloni calls

 finds in the hands of the masters and high foreign finance is around the 
 800 billion! Other than 16 billion!
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  And finally, in the capitalist-imperialist system it is normal that 
 a part of the public debt of each country both in the hands of investors of 
 other countries, foreigners, and in this sense everyone makes "external pressure" each 
 On the other, therefore, all this remains a story to tell to those who fall 
 in the deception of the fascist memory and all "patriotic" of the 
 Meloni.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  While on the shoulders of the proletariat and popular masses, 
 As we said, the weight of the public debt that increases certainly falls 
 everyday more!
  <o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Also for this reason, get rid of Meloni and his 
 Modern fascist propaganda is an urgent need!

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The ex Ilva issue must remain the center of the attention of 
 workers, workers. And certainly not only in Taranto, even if a 
 Taranto fights the main battle on this. But there 
 We must tire of repeating that we are talking about the largest 
 factory of this country which is within a steel group 
 which is of great importance both on a national scale and on a scale 
 European, given the world contest that is underway in the steelurge 
 world, worldwide.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  If you don't understand 
 This, all we say has no sense. This is the 
 point on which we are focusing.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When the 
 government, the masters, say that Ilva is strategic - and they go 
 reaffirming also in these hours - on this we are completely 
 agree with the government. The only question is that "strategic" for 
 We have another value: it has an important value for the working class 
 of our country, for the proletariat and everything that imports 
 For the working class and for the proletariat of our country, he has 
 importance in class struggle, in the conflict between masters and 
 workers, in the conflict between masters and government and workers, in 
 conflict between the state of capital and workers, in the conflict between the way 
 capitalist/imperialistic production and workers. The ILVA is 
 strategic but from the point of view of the working class and from the point of 
 View of the working class the plans that produce masters and government 
 they go in the opposite direction to the plans that should produce the 
 proletariat, the working class, the basic trade union movement and of 
 class, the political organizations that care about the question 
 worker and the role of the working class in the current clash with 
 The entire government, with the entire system in our country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start with 
 end. In Taranto in the morning at 6, in front of the gates, there was the 
 Minister Urso, spearhead in this moment of the application 
 of the strategic line that chose the Meloni government in his 
 together with the service of the most general interests of the owners 
 Italians. The government has chosen to exist and remove the matter 
 Mittal and to resume the temporary management of the 
 factory and then return it to the new masters. New masters of which 
 The final outcome is not yet clear, but the masters are essentially 
 steel, once again represented by the Federacciai e 
 by the other groups engaged worldwide in the dispute 
 on the steel and interest in the Taranto plant that 
 The entire group has in our country.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister came at 6 in the morning to tell the workers of the bales, one 
 fable. “Now that the State has taken up in necessary times there will be the 
 resumption of production, there will be the resumption of workers, there will be 
 the solution of environmental problems in the factory and in the city. " 
 All this is a bale.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister is 
 coming here, he came to Taranto, came from the workers, for 
 tell the story they have told from the beginning of this 
 affair.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

<br>
 Before looking 
 What has been said to see that this minister was 
 collected by a servant cavalier called Palombella, 
 UILM unionist, majority union within the 
 establishment, National Secretary of Metalworkers of Uil.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Pictures 
 themselves of this "Lord" who on behalf of the workers goes to 
 Open the door, they make it seem the servant of the servants. The unionism, which as well 
 In these weeks he had screamed, now he showed up in his guise 
 of servant of the servants to bring the consent of the workers to 
 solutions that the government is taking. Solutions that do not go in 
 Direction of the return to work of the workers of the surface who are 
 out of work for months, which do not go in the direction of the solution 
 not even their elementary guarantee problems, because everything 
 This, Minister Urso practically reconfirmed it.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  From what 
 the solution of these problems, including urgent problems, depending would depend 
 workers? From the EU loan-reward of which the 
 Discussion with the dressger (
  <span data-darkreader-inline-border-bottom="" data-darkreader-inline-border-left="" data-darkreader-inline-border-right="" data-darkreader-inline-border-top="" style="--darkreader-inline-border-bottom: initial; --darkreader-inline-border-left: initial; --darkreader-inline-border-right: initial; --darkreader-inline-border-top: initial; border: none; display: inline-block; padding: 0cm;">
   Commissioner 
 European competition
  </span>
  , ed), from 
 new approach of Europe and on the steelurge, another theme than in the 
 European World Championship of Siderurgia is far from being 
 addressed, and in any case, if it must be addressed, it will be addressed in the 
 framework of the actual power relationships that are in the steelurge 
 European between the different groups and relationships of European steelurgery 
 with world steelurgery.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  “Table for 
 follow closely the application of the support measures 
 to the induced ". Measures that consist essentially in paying 
 Immediately some urgent works, in planning any payment 
 of previous credits and in distributing the layoffs to 
 workers for a period that is not known when it will be. "He confirms 
 of the interest of foreign investors "who, once 
 The Ilva is resumed in the hands of the state and "purged", can 
 be placed to foreign investors, that is, to another Mittal (the most probable candidate seems to be
  <em>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
    Metinvest
   </span>
</em>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
</span>
  of Ukrainian Oligorca in a consortium, more or less consenting, with 
 part of the Italian steel industrialists: it is done in the name of 
 Gozzi, Arvedi and so on).
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Therefore a process 
 that it is said that it will be done within the year, therefore at least within 
 This year there will be no solution or work problems, 
 neither of the problems of wages, nor the problems of the conditions of 
 work, neither of the problems of environmentalization, nor of the problems 
 of the great question of the issues represented by the role 
 pollutant of the Taranto plant.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  It is useless to say 
 like this is related to what will happen in the factories of 
 Cornigliano and Novi Ligure who are partly related to fate 
 municipality of the group, partly conceived also in distinct form 
 compared to the common fate of the group.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  On what they are 
 Then focus the further statements of Minister Urso Fatta 
 In the following moments of his visit to Taranto at the meeting at 
 Prefecture table, with social partners and institutions? Urso has 
 Also spoken in this case of the same problems. Himself 
 he admits that the loan-panty spoke about it on Sunday with the 
 European commissioner Vestager and that he thinks he can and should 
 realize within the limits of European rules. Moreover this 
 Ponte loan is linked to an industrial plan that 
 Show immediately that the Ponte loan can be returned.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  So in none 
 way it is funds for the recovery but it is a loan 
 which, indirectly or directly, was not granted to 
 ArceloMittal or from it not accepted in those dimensions, and which comes 
 re -proposed at other industrial groups that accept it.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "Me 
 I am met several times with the Breton and Vestager commissioners and I have 
 asked to change industry objectives and methods 
 Siderurgica ". Really! Even the Governicchio Meloni, 
 minor partner in Europe - as well as certainly not in harmony 
 Not even with the general interests of the different European masters Vista 
 its location on all themes - should take in 
 consideration the objective changes of the steel industry, 
 otherwise he says - here, yes, rightly - we will be crushed by 
 those who produce outside Europe without respecting the conditions 
 environmental and social and so on, which is obviously connected 
 to the current phase of the world dispute in the steelurge from 
 objectively these effects in the struggle that is underway between 
 they.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  "We have 
 the absolute will to relaunch the steel by guaranteeing one 
 environmental safety that is fundamental for us on a par with 
 work safety ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Apart from the fact that 
 This government that, as you know, is antiambientist, that this 
 Government on the problem of safety at work is for full 
 freedom of business and for the liberalization of the contracts that already 
 produce its effects in the working condition, see the latest 
 deaths at work, this government, like all the governments of the masters 
 In recent years, but even more this government, it is far from 
 be able to be the person who can guarantee environmental security 
 and work safety.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Then reconfirm 
 what has been said not from now but from the beginning of the more phase 
 acute of this crisis: “mandatory to keep the 
 maintainers ". But this is trivial, without maintenance the plant 
 It closes, that's it. So what are we talking about?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  "Can not be done 
 send to layoffs those who work for the safety of 
 plants ”and therefore all the others can very well go in 
 layoff with or without return, in non -definable times.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Urso plan is 
 fried air, the Urso floor is what has been said SIN 
 from the beginning, from the early hours, from this government that has not so far 
 made if not preliminary steps forward in the relationship with the group 
 ArceloMittal, where contradictions are generally acute 
 legally represented in what is happening to 
 Bankruptcy Court of Milan, where the 
 failure of Ilva, and therefore of the insolvency and the mass in 
 Extraordinary administration.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In a condition 
 of factory in bankruptcy and extraordinary administration everything 
 What comes after is a logical consequence. The famous credits 
 claimed by the companies, and so on, they will enter the general cauldron 
 of insolvency, failure, as had already happened in the past and 
 Like all the realities that have crossed this phase they can 
 Stay to demonstrate what really happens in these groups.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Moreover a 
 group that becomes more and more shaky in the world market - 
 Even if it is not our business - it is evident that it does not have 
 effective possibilities of production recovery that can guarantee 
 the occupation of current workers and opens the way to a 
 downsizing, to one of his selling to the last master of duty who 
 It was more or less the same process that it brought Italsider a 
 Riva and subsequently to ArceloMittal and now ... they had another one.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All these things 
 In recent months they have undergone criticism and complaints, more or 
 less correct, more or less "screamed" by all 
 trade union organizations that are in that plant, as well as 
 From us, for reasons that can be well identified. But as if nothing 
 It was today all the unions go up to the chariot of the measures 
 of the government. And just the one who screamed, Palombella, is 
 Becoming the slave, the servant, the government's butler.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore you can 
 It is clear that the state of things in Ilva is a heavy aggravation 
 which falls above all on the workers. And in this heavy 
 aggravation, the only thing you see clearly is that masters, 
 government and unions are the same, they have the same program, 
 against which the workers protest can be raised to start 
 from the actual understanding of what is happening, from 
 understanding of the games that are in progress and by the strenuous defense of the 
 interests of the workers, a trenches necessary to defend the 
 interests of the territory, popular masses and thinking 
 actually to an environmentalization, to difficult reclamation e 
 complex - since we are in the capitalist system - but still 
 A battle to do.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today as never before 
 Workers' autonomy is the only solution, the reconstruction of the 
 strength of workers as strength
  <i>
   against
  </i>
  , do not force for, against the 
 logic of masters, government and unions that go in the direction of 
 deepen the crisis, do not solve the problems of the workers and the 
 popular masses, not only, but to make Ilva even a ring 
 of the next European election campaign.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In all this 
 The Slai Cobas for the class union represents the only item 
 alternative and on this it will be important, both in terms of factories 
 and cities both nationally, and this alternative item yes 
 feel strong and clear and find all the necessary understanding from 
 part of the class and combative trade union movement and of all 
 workers who are directly or indirectly involved in 
 This story.

  Not a day passes when we do not witness the umpteenth insult of the 
 Meloni government to workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In front of the 
 infinite massacre of workers in the workplace, the lack of 
 safety that is a constant, to contracts, to precarious contracts, to 
 Back of the residence permit for immigrant workers related 
 to work contracts, to black work, to low wages, all 
 elements that are part of the exploitation system it brings 
 profits to the masters and misery and accidents and, often, the death on 
 work of the workers, on the wave of anger and pain aroused 
 from the massacre after the collapse of a gigantic construction site in Florence that 
 He killed 5 workers, the government meets with confederals for 
 tell him what the Minister of Labor has already decided 
 CALDERONI - Consultant of the owners appointed minister now - and then 
 bring a provision to the Council of Ministers which is a 
 outrage, an insult to workers who died at work and that leaves in 
 peace the masters, allowing him to continue to be able to deny the 
 safety exposing workers to risk and get away with it for 
 This.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After all, the 
 the same Meloni had explicitly declared that his government “not 
 puts brakes to those who do "
  <strong>
   .
  </strong>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So none 
 novelty in the conception of this government that he puts in all his 
 provision his class matrix, the defense of the interests of 
 Masters at the center of his policy, which carries on their war 
 class with contempt and hatred of workers he expresses 
 also in this case even when he is forced to intervene because 
 There are the deaths and accidents of the workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is proper 
 Because from this government it is not "no news" that you need to 
 organize the struggle, put it on the field with all means, 
 organize the unit of the workers, make it pay dear to 
 Masters and government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The news of 
 These days is that the Council of Ministers approved one 
 scheme of decree-law on the implementation of the PNRR, a sort of 
 "Omnibus" decree - with about fifty articles (49 in the 
 draft attached to the article) and which contains this package 
 Work safety in which there would be various "novelty".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister says 
 that this provision follows the three c: “Controls, contrast e 
 compliance for an accompaniment to regularizations, to a 
 regular behavior of companies ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Meanwhile the first 
 insulting novelty is its scope of application: this is a 
 provision that limits its action only to construction sites and not to the other sectors 
 of work, from factories to warehouses to countryside.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The same 
 Minister of Labor and Social Policies, cauldron, has 
 remembered in his information to the Council of Ministers of 
 last February 21 - After the worker massacre on the construction site in Florence 
 - that “as regards the inspection access in construction, the 
 level of irregularity recorded was 76.48%, with a 
 average irregularity rate that exceeds 85.2% in the case of companies 
 engaged in work connected to the Superbonus 110%".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The government 
 It therefore recognizes that there is the violation of the safety rules 
 and on the contracts in construction but acts in the opposite direction instead 
 that increase controls with criminal penalties for contracts e 
 subcontracting, instead of canceling the waterfall contracts, repeal the 
 Salvini decree liberalizing contracts.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The provision 
 he says that hiring will be unlocked to increase the 
 contingent of work inspectors, of the inspection nucleus 
 Carabinieri and inspection staff of INPS and INAIL that will be able to 
 increase controls by 40%.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The propaganda of 
 Government announces another 766 work inspectors, but that in reality yes 
 it deals with 466 hires that will be unlocked (on the basis of a 
 old competition with the Draghi government) and 300 new hires, 
 250 of all these should be destined for safety e 
 on health at work, 50 are carabinieri under the structures 
 inspections, which nationally, in relation to 4,500,000 
 census companies - only those registered, therefore - not 
 Absolutely nothing will change regarding the controls.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the heart of 
 This measure is the notorious "points license".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  After the massacre 
 worker of Florence, the Secretary General of the CGIL, Landini, 
 Responding with only 2 hours of strike, he said that the 
 institutions and the government must intervene in order not to allow more 
 that other workers die. “The license must be established a 
 points. Companies that do not respect the rules must not be able to 
 work, they must be closed, they must not be able to participate in 
 contracts. Instead, those that respect the 
 safety rules ".
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 government, government union, the CISL also appreciates this 
 tool that - underlines the secretary Luigi Sbarra - 
 it corresponds to a substance to an advanced proposal in 2003 by his 
 trade union.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 Meloni/Calderone/Salvini government took them in question to hit the 
 working conditions of the construction sites.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The license is 
 issued by the National Labor Inspectorate after registration 
 to the company's Chamber of Commerce and provides for the fulfillment, from 
 part of the employer and workers, of the obligations 
 training; possession of the DURC, a single regularity document 
 Tax and the risk assessment document.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And here it is so much 
 Easy to prepare this documentation for the masters, the DVR is 
 even prepared by themselves who define where and which 
 They would be the risks in the workplace for workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The license a 
 Credits should enter into operation from 1 October 2024.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For the company or 
 for the self -employed worker without the license or with a number of 
 credits of less than 15, the administrative sanction from 6 thousand to 
 12 thousand euros.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The score 
 initial is 30: in the event of a fatal accident, 20 are reduced 
 credits, while for permanent disability you go down to 15, for 
 Temporary disability 10 credits are reduced.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this is a 
 insult to the dead workers and all workers the passage of 
 This provision that provides that reduced credits can 
 be recovered with training courses! Other than the tightening of 
 sanctions, as announced the propaganda of the Meloni government, it is 
 of yet another, even more hateful amnesty to the masters because 
 it concerns the life of the workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We reported in 
 a previous worker counter -information after the construction site massacre 
 In Florence: "How much is the life of a worker worth?" And the government, with 
 This provision, replies in a chilling way that for it 
 "It is worth 20 points" but in reality, as we have seen, also nothing, 
 Because a training course is enough to continue as before!
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Remains the 
 cascade subcontracting. The only positive note is that it is introduced 
 The social clause which also provides for the subcontracting the application 
 of the most used contract in the sector, but only applies to the 
 remuneration, not for the regulatory part as the obligations to the 
 training, working hours, etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister 
 Calderone says to introduce "the criminal offense for the interposition 
 illegal labor », in cases where the labor comes 
 administered without there being a regular contract and a 
 detachment of regular staff, this on the one hand, but to the same 
 the civil sanctions are reduced, in the event of violation of the 
 Safety rules just get in order.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And to all those 
 Companies found in order will be issued a certificate and registered 
 (after consent) the employer in a special list 
 IT COMPUTER CONSULTABLE publicly and called “List of 
 Inl compliance ". The masters, to whom the certificate was issued, 
 So they will not be subjected to further checks for twelve months 
 in the subjects subject to the investigations.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nothing changes for 
 The workers of the contract.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No 
 provision to enhance and extend the function of the RLS and the 
 representatives of site safety as well as no location 
 inspection and health in large companies, construction sites, ports, 
 As the Slai Cobas claims for the class union with the struggle 
 in the realities in which we are present.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No 
 provision on wages, precarious contracts, on the breakdown of the bond 
 between residence permit and employment contract, which are the 
 claims of the struggles of the basic unions.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The USB for months 
 is collecting the signatures in support of a law to introduce the 
 crime of murder at work and to present it to the chamber presidents 
 and Senate so that the discussion arrives in parliamentary classrooms e 
 So the Fillea herself, the union of the CGIL building, also does 
 appeal to political forces to modify this provision in 
 Parliament.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How can we 
 have confidence that in parliament something changes? the same opposition 
 who was never done anything to the government yesterday to intervene against 
 deaths at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The CGIL launches a 
 referendum with the collection of signatures (there will be 500 thousand) and the 
 Possible vote in spring 2025. “On the pitch to change the laws 
 wrong and propose another social and development model ”against 
 Job act, layoffs, precariousness and contracts.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But when never the 
 issues concerning the conditions of the workers have been 
 Do you conquer with a referendum? The escalator was perhaps not 
 canceled with a referendum?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  History 
 evidently it continues not to teach or in any case the confederals do 
 other choices as conciliators with the interests of the owners
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The USB organizes 
 for next Saturday, March 2, an event with a procession that 
 It will start from Piazza Dalmatia to the Esselunga construction site and also a 
 Conference in Florence in which the introduction of the crime will be discussed 
 murder at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Surely 
 Returning to the place of the massacre is a decision that we share.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the problem is 
 Always that: who will have to make the laws that are unexpissed the penalties for 
 The assassins?

 The farmers, who had a block in Egnatia and closed the entrance of the port daily, for over 20 days for a two -hour period, participated by agricultural machinery and block. Public workers' unions, the Labor Center and Private Workers, Trade Unions and Political Organizations were also involved. Noteworthy was the participation of students with their own blocs from most of the city's high schools and high schools, despite the threats to some of the management that there will be miscarriages.

<p>
  The class course had its own block shouting slogans against the anti -populist murderous policy of the system and distributed its announcement in the previous days in workplaces.

  The rage in all the pieces of the people was evident, as was the reflection on discussions about the continuation of the struggle that must be common, a reflection that did not find a response from trade unions, as many realized that there was this gap in the face of escalation. attack.

    Under the motto "Defending democracy - against right -wing extremism and racism", a rally and sea of lights with around 4,000 participants were also organized in Linz. The organizers often did not approach democratically. Many of those present rightly wondered whether an election advertising for SPÖ and the Greens was not organized here.

    The organizers primarily focus on the meetings unveiled by the "Correctiv" research platform in Potsdam, where, among other things, Identity Director Martin Sellner was present. This unveiling triggered a wave of protests in Germany. There were now numerous demonstrations "against right" in Austria.

    We asked some participants about their impressions from the rally in Linz. The statements essentially reflected one thing: there was a lot of “blah” without content.
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "Like a sermon without amen"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    , said one of the respondents. Another said:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     “Green and red, betting here for blue! It is more of a "hidden" election campaign that is organized here, an election advertising without logos. "
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    The organizers “banned” party logos and state flags. Nevertheless, the nearby relationship with various parties cannot be denied. This rally, organized by Beverly Allen-Stingeder (SPÖ women's chairman for the Urfahr-Umgeben district), was planned for February 9 on its private initiative "Red Glasses". However, this had to be postponed against right -wing extremism due to a nationwide campaign day. Fridays for Future can certainly be seen as a "green-close", especially since Lena Schilling from FFF for the Greens is the top candidate in the EU election. In addition, many party -related organizations promoted this rally.

    How much the organizers the "Democracy defend" showed to be carried out in the ban on state flags. For this reason, a participant had made up the colors of the Palestinafe on the eyelids because she found out about the ban before the event and still wanted to set an example. One participant in the rally had passed the state flag of Palestine. He was immediately asked to remove the flag by several folders, because the organizers would like it. Even after some discussion that the flag of Palestine in particular, a prime example of how strongly in Austria the democratic rights with feet are triggered and that this rally was not about defending democratic rights, freedom of expression, freedom of speech and freedom of demonstration Only in nothing, the folders even called the police to force the participant to remove the flag of Palestina. When the rally ended, the participant stood back with the flag and immediately came a folder and asked him to remove the flag. When it was pointed out that the event was already over and that the "ban" no longer applies, she said succinctly:

    In summary, it must be said that the democratic rights can certainly not be defended by further bans. The organizers are also directed against those who really want to take to defend democratic rights and against fascation on the streets and try to force them into the narrow corset of pseudo-liberal bourgeois parties. The course of democracy and social mining is far from being found in one party. Therefore, the anti -fascist struggle, the struggle for democratic and social rights, cannot be degraded to the campaign helper by red and green, but must be directed against the rulers.

Despite all the efforts of the system, with the tool of suppression, terrorism and the exhaustion of struggles, as well as the subordinate trade union leaders, people have shown that they can and need to turn his anger and indignation into a struggle.
  <br>
<br>
  The gathering was attended by the ESA, the Hospital Workers' Association, the two educational associations, as well as the Bess Student Association. A common banner participated in the demonstration of the teacher movements and the class course.

  In the course of the island on the streets of the world, the disruption of the world was obvious. ACC and T.P. They tried with their slogans to highlight the period in question. They denounced the crime of the system in Tempi, stressed the need for the people and youth to come to the forefront, on a joint struggle front, to claim better terms of work, free studies, political and trade union freedoms. Anti -imperialist slogans and slogans of solidarity were also shouted to the struggling Palestinian people.

 The demonstration closed in the city square with the speeches of the representatives of the clubs and the participants. On the part of PAME/KKE that controls most of them, the tone of a festive closing of the games was obvious. Without any plan for the sequel, with general class crowns, with the wrong political estimates and management requests. With the anxiety of declaring the latest struggles of the last period that as hopeful and massive they were, they still have a way ahead of them to be more massive and overthrow government and system plans. After all, the closure of the rural struggles the day before, made the PAME/KKE aspirations obvious to be the 28th not a principle for the formation of a single joint front between workers, farmers and youth but the end of the races and subordination to urban legitimacy and systemic aspirations.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But the mass popular participation is. How the popular masses want and can go out on the street. How they need to walk against the policies of misery, bans and the constant deterioration of their lives. How the example of student youth and poor peasantry can well evolve into a mass frontal popular movement that will fight to put a brake on the attack.

 The forces referring to the Left and the Movement, with all the forces that have, in all areas they intervene, need to fight to find the 28th. To fight so that people and youth do not accept the end of the struggles, not to pinch in the Euros elections that are ready to serve them from the right and the "left". To try to build terms of continuing racing mobilizations in the direction of conflict and clash with the government and the system.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="https://ruhrgebietskonferenz-pflege.de/stiller-rationierung-durch-fach-und-arbeitskraeftemangel-entgegenwirken/">
   Yesterday the first Ruhr area conference of care took place in Gelsenkirchen under the slogan "nursing triage summit".
  </a>
  The conference was organized by public sponsors such as the AWO, Diakonie, various foundations and private companies such as "Humanitas" from Essen as well as the advocacy representation of caring relatives in North Rhine -Westphalia. Neither part of the host organizers nor in the supporting program of the conference were represented by the nursing chamber of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia as the professional representative of all nurses nor the Verdi union, which the nursing workers represent in their industrial struggles.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The linchpin of the conference and the supporting program was with the slogan around the nursing triage, the risk that patients in the future will be increasingly neglected or completely dismissed. But the term triage has a different meaning in care than the definition that we got to know in the Corona years. Nursing triage means that the easier case is rather accepted with the argument that more people are cared for correctly and cases with higher levels of care that are more common to involve specialists due to economic savings and labor shortages. Under this over topic, various lectures, including quarters in outpatient care, restriction and lack of special care, were held by the managing directors of various companies. In addition, there was also a round of talks in which the spokesman for the SPD health policy also took part in NRW.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The result of the conference: By 2030, around 130,000 nurses are missing nationwide, which means that 1.1 million people will not get a place of care that they need.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, the question of nursing triage and labor shortage for development into a decent health system is justified, this entrepreneurial conference will not solve none of the problems.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For example, because companies in care for the most part are responsible for this that the workers run away from them or do not even want to start with them. A high degree of overtime, too few staff and too much burden and partly ridiculous wages compared to work performance are only a few of the reasons, which is why fewer and fewer people go into care. And the nursing companies carry this only normal capitalist, profit -oriented companies are a large part in addition to that of the crisis policy of the bourgeois state. Added to this is the decoration of nursing workers if they have justified the strike against these conditions as shown in recent years. Then the work buyers often emphasize that care would not be a profession, but a "calling" and that every seriously managed struggle for political and economic improvements would harm patient care. This stitch is also known from many other professions in the health and social sector. This is the question of the daily claims of the nursing workers and these can only be fought if the nurses meet together on a proletarian class basis in the health sector and decide for their demands and rights.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Another problem that should be remembered just before the International Women's Fighting Day on March 8th
  <a href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1029877/umfrage/verteilung-von-pflegekraefte-in-deutschland-nach-pflegeart-und-geschlecht/">
   Is that the absolute majority of all nursing workers women at 82 percent.
  </a>
  As in so many health and social sectors, the proportion of reproduction work paid is disproportionately high there. Only for comparison, in the total population women make up 46 percent of employees subject to social security contributions. Therefore, even in nursing, the need for a class -conscious women's movement shows which for their own interests fight against the special patriarchal exploitation in nursing and is committed to health care in the sense of the working class and the people.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, the basic problem is that care, like any other social area, works according to the principles of capitalist profit logic. This means that the care of older relatives, people with disabilities and sick people is not the purpose of care in imperialism, but to make as much money as possible. However, since the majority of society consists of the working class and the people and always has financial means in order to afford an appropriate, expensive care, care is dependent on government aids. However, like so much in the health and social sector, these state aids are being deleted massively.
  <a href="https://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/148940/Haushalt-enthaelt-keinen-Bundeszuschuss-zur-Pflegeversicherung-mehr#:~:text=F%C3%BCr%202024%20sind%20der%20erg%C3%A4nzende,1%2C0%20Milliarden%20Euro).">
   For the federal budget in 2024, the federal grant was completely deleted for long -term care insurance, which means a subsidiary of 1 billion euros.
  </a>
  A health system that really focuses on our needs is not to be made in imperialism because the system designed to make money out of our medical hardship and to ensure that it is increasingly to ensure adequate health care. So if we want to focus on care, but rather the health of the working class and the people, we and above all the workers in nursing for socialism in which the care facilities in the hands of the people and not in that of Are companies.

    On April 11, 2023, the rooms were simply blocked by the city/MA34 in the course of the renovation of the building and instead of the FZ on the WUK on April 21, 200th! On April 24, 2023, the FZ was immediately locked out from the WUK from all rooms of the stairs 6 and meticulously woke up that only nobody from the FZ could enter the rooms, unless the WUK first let individual women in security accompaniment to the rooms that were then closed again. Finally, police accompaniment was even required for the FZ necessary steps to access such, but necessary steps, from the WUK management !!! Our things are still in stairs 6.

    Not only the FZ classifies the WUK as a compliant administrator of the neoliberal conversion in the interests of the city of Vienna. There have already been some on what is going on. Who does not parry and submits to the updated conditions, who does not sign and pays:

    The FZ colonized the rooms of Stiege 6 in 1981 with the express intent and the concept of establishing a feminist center exclusively for women and lesbians, which was also successful with a lot of effort and patience and many, many feminists. That was also clear to the WUK and the federal government. (The federal government handed over the property to the city of Vienna in 1988, which also knew about the FZ).

     The FZ is today one of the last major women centers all over Europe, autonomous-feminist and still in self-government!
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    The work in the FZ is on a voluntary basis and without subsidies, there is no adolescent of the rooms or no consumption compulsion in our communication room. We offer women's maid maid migrants rooms for large and small projects, namely affordable contributions to expenses ... While all this time of the construction site and the lock and without rooms of the FZ, our work was continued: international feminist structures were preserved by the artists in foreign rooms , Feminist self -defense was continued, feminist memory and artistic, musical activities as well as demo preparations alongside all the strenuous work on the trial due to possession of the possession during this time and will continue to be done ...
   </span>
<span style="font-weight:700">

     The rooms belong to us and we will have them back!

     In contrast, the WUK after the rental contract signing:
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    The Wuk association with its 180 (!) Employees, however, signed a "rental agreement" on the FZ and Stiege 6 with the city (MA 34, on behalf of the then City Councilor Michael Ludwig) on behalf of the then city councilor Michael Ludwig), although Such a procedure is legally wrong and completely impossible. And was always rejected by the FZ! The WUK was never in the possession of the complete building and nobody can simply sign a rental contract about the neighbor's stay and then also present a "loan contract" with horrendous costs (for the FZ) for signature! The WUK is highly subsidized and also receives the subsidies for the operating costs of the entire building from the city of Vienna.

<span>
     Contrary to all the previous assertions, the WUK board with approval of the assembled members in the WUK has carried out this loan contract for the FZ with the approval of the assembled members in the WUK that "everything stays as it is" for the FZ in the awareness that the FZ has no funding.
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    With the intention of negative consequences for the FZ, this can be clearly seen! And the City of Vienna absolutely wants to subordinate the FZ to the WUK by means of this rental agreement.
   </span>
<span style="font-weight:700">
<span>
     The city's interest is to adequate the building and control the groups in it.
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    Therefore, some groups and people have already left the WUK ... The WUK - as it is named by people in the WUK itself - is the administration for the neoliberal conversion of the conditions for the users of this public building. Gentrification is currently everything.

   On February 29 and March 1, 1948, the unarmed exiles in Makronisos received a murderous attack by the alphabets. The attack evolved into a massacre of hundreds of exiles. Their only "offense": were included in the EAM and the EPON during the Occupation.

  At the end of February 1948, one of the most horrifying and heinous crimes of the history of the Greek Civil War took place. More than 300 unarmed exiled ghosts and political prisoners in Makronisos were murdered by the American fascist state just because they did not sign the notorious statements of repentance. This group crime was tried by the official authorities to silence it without succeeding. Eventually, by distorting the events, they spoke of 17 dead exiles, even throwing responsibility.

   The establishment of the hell
  </b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  A few months after the start of the Civil War, in April 1947, the launch of the largest gathering camp was approved in Makronisos. On the island that is impossible to inhabit, since it is a huge rock in the sea, anhydrous and without a single tree, the first leftist leftists arrived in May 1947. Then the 1st ETO was founded (the first Special Armed Forces Battalion).
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In essence, they are leftists and communists who most have participated in the National Resistance with the EAM and were suspected of participating in the TSE. In Makronisi they were transferred unarmed and the aim of the government was to "recover" by signing statements by repentance that would denounce communist ideology. The head of the "reforming work" of Makronis was Brigadier George Bayraktaris.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In January 1948, the Second ETO - ETO (especially for the restoration camps) was created where political prisoners were transferred. Finally, the 3rd, the Order of Torture was created. Shortly thereafter (1/3/1948), the Makronisos (Athens Military Prisons) were transferred to Makronisos (1/3/1948), commanded by the infamous Vassilopoulos. In the same year, the 4th Battalion of Political Exiles was created. In 1950 more than 1,000 women (many with their children) were exiled. A total of about 100,000 exiles passed through the island until 1958, when the latter left.

  It seems that for the monarcho -fascist state and their transatlantic bosses did not reach the prosecutions, military courts and executions of militants. The wisdom of the Greek people could not bend. They wanted to isolate thousands of them in the dryness in order to have the power of life and death on them, to forcefully distract statements to wander around cities and villages as trophies of their "victory". Torture, beatings to death were everyday for Makronisos. Hunger and thirsty permanent companion of the exiles. The endless hours in the unbearable heat, the martyrdom of the stone, the enclosure of the "wire" and the virtual executions were some of the torturers used to crush the soul of the militants. But unjustly. After months of systematic physical and psychological torture and with official data from the authorities of the Greek Army, only 700 in 5,000 of the first one signed statements. This was also the essential reason for the decision to make the 1948 group murder.

   The Great Slaughter of 1948
  </b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  In the first time, all the exiles who refused to make a statement were gradually transferred, the "incomprehensible" as they were told. Despite the repeated torture, the vast majority refused to sign. So at the end of 1947 the decision was made to more drastic measures. A group murder, a massive massacre was considered the appropriate solution that would terrorize all exiles and distract the signature from them. In the last days of 1947 the threats to exiled were more than specific. They gave them 2 months of life!
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  So on Sunday, February 29, 1948 at the morning gathering of the first year, while the patients were not used to come, the alphabets brought them for violence and were hitting them in the eyes of the other concentrated. This enraged the rest of the screams who reacted with voices. The scene was set up and with the first protests, the Alphamites began and the officers were shooting, killing 5 and injuring many more.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  But the biggest crime took place the next day when a ship of the Navy was sailing near the first year. Many officers with weapons, mussels up to cannons were ready for the slogan to start the new slaughter. At the same time on land hundreds of alphabets with bats and weapons were ready to chill to the unarmed ghosts. The slogan was given by Bayraktaris and all together, by land and sea, were engaged in an orgy of murder against unarmed ghosts. Even those who fell into the sea to be rescued, found a tragic death from the gossip of the ship's cannons.

  Yiannis Kofinas remembers: "The first ones dived, with the announcement that they saw redemption. But as they were in the water, Nassos and the war reaches 37. It cut speed and weighed near - near the rocks we were 20 meters from us. On the deck of the Cordus, the boar, the Bayraktaris ... at the same time he heard a sharp order: you opened fire. The four -dimensional cosks of Erlington rattled demonized. They hit the mass. Panic to all of us. The fire is stormy. Hell of fire. Dead in the sea, dead on the rocks. " (Geladopoulos p. 143)
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  More than 300 were killed in total and hundreds injured. The official state, referring to these events, threw responsibility to the ghosts themselves who accused them of being struck, referring only to 17 dead.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  But there are dozens of testimonies that the real number of dead were more than 300. A very important testimony is that of Dr. Leonidas Georgilakos who revealed that on March 2, 1948, he examined more than 180 corpses: "Tuesday, March 2, 1948, 8am, 8th time , I examined hundreds of corpses I drafted and signed the death certificate of the soldiers of the first Order of Macronisos ... First we were taken to the port, to the boat and lowered us to the hold. I shuddered what I saw. Down in the holder the dead were about thirty ... In the holder, the alphabets placed the bodies in order…. Finally, the hold was filled and then placed the carcasses on the boat, on the deck ... The total were 180 dead. Lieutenant-Colonel Mr. Alibrantis wrote the text that we confirmed the 180 corpses and put our signature ... "(on the same pp. 178-182).
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Another important testimony is that of the captain of the kayak Mimi Vrontamitis who refers to 350 dead: "In the terrible March 1948 rifle, the staircase stuck my pistol on my head and threatened me to carry me to carry, In Xeronissos San Giorgio ... On a single itinerary we loaded 185 dead fans ... There in San Giorgio he was waiting for a war boat. The sailors took the killed ghosts and pissed them into wire nets with weights and fooled them at the bottom of the sea. This was again ... The dead everyone - everyone was 350 nearby, one by one and there were 350 dead dead. " (on the same pp. 190-191).

  Whatever efforts made by the subsequent governments to hide the events of 1948 in Makronisos, the "National Swimming" and the "Souls of Souls" by Konstantinos Tsatsos, the "New Parthenon" by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, in the memory of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos. The island of barbarism, the largest hell that created the monarcho -fascist state and the Americans in Greece, but at the same time the place where horrific torture failed to bend thousands of fighters who lived or died with their heads high.

  A large crowd was the strike of 28 February in Trikala, a year after the Railway Crime in Tempi. Hundreds of Trikalins participated in the rally in Riga Feraiou Square where they were calling on public and private unions, the student associations of the city (TEFAA and nutrition), which are for 8th week in mobilization, professional associations and associations. Blocks and a notice was involved in the racing movements of teachers and with dynamic slogans participated in the path that followed in the city center and ended up at the train station.
 </p>
<p>
  The people and youth of the city have shown their militant moods. When allowed to resist this barbaric policy, they prove that they want and can get off the road. The continuing student struggle and the rural mobilizations of the latest show show that there are fuels for a resistance front in this policy. The task of the forces they act in this direction is to continue in this struggle, against the "official" and non -forces that want the people on the sidelines.

  The demonstration against private universities and the Pierrakakis N/Perrakakis was held with mass massiveness than that of previous weeks. This mass, corresponding to that of the General Assemblies of the Week, is also due to the remuneration that is now made in most institutions and telegrams that have begun in some schools. However, it seems that there is still a mood for students. People are still going out on the street. It seems that there is a mood for students to discuss and fight against private universities
 </p>
<p>
  The racing moves we participated in demonstration in a common bloc with teacher movements and student resistance. We shouted slogans against Pierrakakis and private universities, class barriers and repression.
 </p>
<p>
  It is necessary and in view of the vote of the N/C on 8/3 to re -enagrow the assemblies and the Pan -Hellenic Education rally. Let us not let them vote for the bill and even if they make it fight, reinforce the fight to be abolished.

 Horror is caused to every person with emotions by the stories of Al Jazeera journalists about the new heinous massacre committed by the Israeli army. According to the Arab channel (which dozens of journalists have been cold -blooded), the Zionists slaughtered the people waiting for the tail for flour!

  Specifically, in the area southwest of the city of Gaza, and while a tail of "humanitarian aid" had been set up for a little flour, (and while it is known that many families are now feeding on feed or die hunger), the Israelis hit the spot. The result was over 100 dead and hundreds of injured. Indeed, it is complained that the tanks passed over the dead and injured.
  <b>
   It's another crime of the occupation army!
  </b>
  Who, because he cannot effectively face resistance, erupts in civilians, women, children, schools and hospitals ... blackmails the people of Gaza to leave his home, and then cold -blooded the "safe concentration points"! Every human being has to ask seriously what if the business against Rafa starts, near the border with Egypt, where 1.5 million hunted Palestinians have been raised ...
 </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
  It has filled the internet videos from the trucks that pick up the carcasses and the injured, to die to die in the Gaza hospitals that have been deprived of supplies.
 </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
  International reactions are huge. Even the US, both for political reasons (see diplomatic contacts) and for public image reasons, are forced to call for "investigation of the event". While still the shocking image of the American misery that has set fire to the Israeli embassy. The media, after initially talking about "Palestinians who were trampled upon each other" (as they allegedly ... bombed their hospital!), Then they said that the Israeli soldiers were "afraid of threatening moves". Finally, they are forced under the weight of blood to present the news.
 </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
  Where are the prestigious Greek journalists, the media, the ... mornings (!), The various "personalities", to cry the dead and to "condemn violence"? Where is the ... Arkas and the various "enlightened" intellectuals? Where are all those who discovered the Middle East and Palestine on October 7 and forgot it right after? Did they swallow their language and consciously conceal another Nazi Zionist crime? Companions! Sweeteners of killers and hypocrites, you also have the blood in your hands!

  To change the development of the events, the generals of the High Command will have to pay much more than they would have paid, for example, in 2017. There is no doubt that the situation for the popular and revolutionary struggle has become even more favorable.
 </p>
<p>
  The counter-revolutionary offensive of the High Command of the Armed Forces (ACFA), which is about to complete nine years, lost the initiative after the disastrous riot on 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of January of 2023, even more so now with the progress of the investigations. The Armed Forces lost a large part of the “legitimacy” that they claimed to have due to their actions during the Bolsonaro’s government, which were criminal attacks against the people and the Nation, as many of their coup plots came to light. Additionally, its image as a “holy and pure”, “incorruptible” institution had already crumbled, when complaints emerged due to the overpricing in its supplies, the brutal inequality of salaries between the low ranks and the high rank officers, without even mentioning the administration with interests of the Covid-19 pandemic. But why has the ACFA’s counter-revolutionary offensive the terrain more unfavorable to them?
 </p>
<p>
  When the then Army commander, Eduardo Villas-Bôas (representative of the hegemonic right in ACFA) said in 2017 that “
  <em>
   the Armed Forces must be silent protagonists so that society knows that the crisis will not exceed certain limits
  </em>
  ”, and launched the slogans of “
  <em>
   legitimacy, stability, legality
  </em>
  ”, was establishing a military intervention plan. All the concerns and scenarios thought by the ACFA were centered on two aspects: on the one hand, it was necessary to centralize the reactionary institutions by making them work under a single reactionary plan formulated by them, to face a scenario of popular uprising; additionally, it was necessary to subject such institutions as much as possible, without clashing with the legal order, without appearing to be a military coup, in order to not generate resistance from the majority of society and even from other institutions, which could end up losing space in Political Power. It was the Armed Forces’ intervention plan in national political life willing to prevent the worsening of the revolutionary situation, which had redeveloped after the Popular Uprisings of 2013-14. In this plan, an institutional rupture would only be justified as a last resort; or, in the words of Villas-Bôas and other so-called “legalist generals” (read, the hegemonic right in ACFA): institutional rupture would only be in the case of what he calls a “social crisis”, to safeguard the “constituted powers” . A covered coup, in short, that would only be unveiled in extreme cases.
 </p>
<p>
  The movements of the Bolsonarist extreme right, seeking to dispute the direction of the counter-revolutionary offensive and precipitate the institutional rupture, generated a situation that, today, the reactionary Armed Forces were once again unmasked as essentially coup plotters. The investigations brought to public all the rottenness in the Armed Forces, all the elements of the coup preparations, showing that – yes – Brazil was close to returning to a military regime, whatever the result, and that this is not “a thing from past”.
 </p>
<p>
  Let’s see the practical result of the ACFA’s right-wing plan. This, which intended to carry out the military intervention gradually to remove what it considered an excess of power from the STF, today finds itself being investigated by a much stronger STF, which concentrates more functions than it had before. Congress, which according to the ACFA plan should have less power and functions, today has control not only over the country’s political agenda, but over the most important part of the Budget itself; Congress has never been more powerful. Today, culminating the military intervention with the closure of the regime by force in an attempt to combat a popular or revolutionary uprising will produce resistance ten, a hundred times bigger, from various segments of society, including right-wing and reactionary ones; a military coup “to safeguard the powers” is much less justifiable today than it was in 2017, even for the traditional right. All institutions, which according to the ACFA plan should be centralized, have become even more ambitious in their struggle for political power: the STF “runs over” Congress and the latter wants to subject the STF to itself; the Chamber of Deputies “runs over” the Federal Senate; the National Congress controls the federal government, etc. Consequently, the political crises grows, the tendency towards the ineffectiveness of the government system, the unmasking of political characters in front of the masses and the growing discredit of institutions in front of the people. Everything leads to the intensification of the classes struggle, to the worsening of the revolutionary situation that the ACFA, in 2015, intended to calm, when it launched its preventive counter-revolutionary offensive.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite maintaining high vigilance against the coup – as it has not been defeated strategically, and has not been averted in the short term –, it is necessary to recognize that the path to military intervention is more unfavorable. To change the development of the events, the generals of the High Command will have to pay much more than they would have paid, for example, in 2017. This is the main point. There is no doubt that the situation for popular and revolutionary struggle has become even more favorable.

   Recently I received an honorary invitation by the well -known historian Menelaos Charalambides to participate in the presentation of his book "The Dosiologists" recently released (Alexandria editions). This book, as well as that by Dimitris Kousouris, who had been written for several years earlier, entitled "Trials of the 1944-1949 dosage" (Polis 2014 editions) are in my opinion the top books written on the issue to date. Both are the result of a long, exhaustive, authentic and original research of their writers and captures the historical truth about the subject with great precision and completeness.
  </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
   My participation in the presentation of the book has proved to be a reflection that has been in the adoption and prevalence of the term "biogens" for years. Because as a lawyer I know, like all lawyers, that this concept is formulated in the Civil Code (explicitly in Article 303 and as a legal relationship in a multitude of provisions of the AK, commercial law, etc.) without having the derogatory character with which he has been handed over to history. According to Article 303 AK : "Anyone who has the management of a whole or some foreign case, since management involves receipts and expenses, is obliged to be held accountable. To this end, the dose must announce to the right -wing account that contains a confrontation between revenue and expenses, as well as what results from this controversy and to attach the supporting documents if they are used. "
  </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
   The different spelling of the word (in particular the finalization of the "dossi" instead of "dosogal") is probably due to the compilation of the Civil Code with the PD. 456/1984. Until then the word was written in both ways. Today in its legal sense it is written with O and its historical usually with ω.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>

   Consequently, the dosage is nothing more than what we usually call as accountable. And this property is found not only in private law, which is regulated by the Civil Code, part of which (private law) is both commercial and public law, and concerns any public property manager, accountable, authorized, etc. With others Words, the dose is a person who, through the formulation of private and public law transactions, is obliged to account and his obligation to accountability, when fulfilled, makes him a dose and his evaluation depends on whether he responds to the rules where he is obliged to carry out the management of the property for which he is held accountable and evaluated by the right, who is usually the owner of the property managed by the dose.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   It should also be noted that the Civil Code, which includes Article 303 referred to and entered into force on 01.03.1946. Of course, it was legislated before it came into force: with AN. 2250/1940 AK and with AN 2783/1941 its introductory law. But even before legislation, a relatively long and abnormal period of law was preceded by 1930 and apparently this word was included in the relevant drafts, as in the literature. There may have been some of the earlier urban codes merged and abolished after the post of present (political law 1835, which was largely copied by Armenopoulos's hexagon, and various local urban codes, such as Ionian, Samiakos, Samiakos etc). According to Stefanos Koumanoudis ("Synagogue of new words ..."), the word was introduced into the Greek vocabulary around 1840.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Therefore, the legal concept of the dose does not represent anything derogatory and derogatory, but a common in private and public law legal status with the characteristics and obligations mentioned above.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   But then why were the traitors and associates of the Germans simply described as "biogens"? And why has the word "biogens" today to be considered an insult?
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The concepts, before being formulated with the legislator's stylus, are more widely shaped by social evolution by politics. The retrospective of modern Greek history retrieves the word "biogens" for the first time in the last decade of the 19th century, that is, the bankruptcy of the Greek state, where a popular wave of rage demanded that the public property be given by those who managed public property and led the country. in bankruptcy. A second recovery is found shortly after the Asia Minor Disaster and the dominance of the Plastira movement, where the Investigative Committee of Dossia of Asia Minor is again established, in order to examine the financial management of the Asia Minor campaign. A third recovery, especially recent at that time, and in every respect, was that in the same word "dossiologists" the ... dozen government of Tsolakoglou characterized those who had participated in the Government of John Metaxas because they involved Greece in the 1940 war.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The government selection of the designation of "biogens" on dealing with the German associates during the occupation does not have at least its roots at the Lebanese National Congress, which was, among other things, addressing the issue of German associates. In its fulfillment, the first draft law on sanctions against those who were prepared by then -Minister of Justice Themistocles Tsatsos contained the term "collaborators", as was the recent French legislation (of the Provisional Government of Free Government. 1943), as well as in Ordonnace of 26.6.1944. Because cooperation was considered and correctly considered a synonym of betrayal. In Free Greece, at the same time, the only law for the associates of the conqueror was the legislative act No. 8/24.03.1944 of the Mountain Government (PEA = Political Committee of National Liberation), which predicted that:
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   "Anyone who works with the Germans and the Bulgarian conquerors in the fight against the national struggle and the oppression of the Greek people either with their involvement in the supposed government that they established either by ranking in the Security Battalions I formed or with their support for them. The organs of the conquerors, or in any other way, is declared an enemy of the homeland, guilty of a treason and punished with the death penalty and confiscation of his property. "
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Legally noteworthy in the content of this act, which I suppose was drawn up by Alexandros Svolos, a leading constitutionalist and lawmaker, president of the PEEA, are the following:
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   a) Non -establishment of retroactivity, an option that demonstrates particular respect for the principle of "Nullum Crimen Nulla Poena Sine Lege", on the one hand with the choice of time, which shows that this act is applied from now on and on the other hand, the lack of reference to cooperation With the Italians, who had now capitulated and left Greece since September 1943
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   (b) The establishment of a crime of behavior that does not accuse the challenge and occurrence of any outcome for its constitution.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   This act was in place within the limits of the territory exercised by the PEEA, one of the three governments of the Greek state at that time, since of course there was the Government of Dosiogou Ioannis Ralli, as well as the government. of Cairo, by G. Papandreou.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Subsequently, the Ralli government was abolished in practice with the departure of the Germans (earlier by various legislative acts of other governments), PEA. On 5.11.1944 the legislation was also resolved at the same time to confront the German associates was the number 1/03.11.1944 Constitutional Act of the National Unity Government "on imposing criminal penalties against those with the enemy" (Government Gazette 12 "(Government Gazette 12" /06.11.1944).
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   In accordance with Article 1 thereof: "During the enemy occupation, he was intentionally treated a treacherous after the enemy, there was no benefit to him or damage to the national and allied struggle or to a Greek citizen or a citizen of a state. provisions of this Act. "
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Characteristics of this provision were the shrinkage of the objective status of the projected offense, as compared to the provision of the PEEA legislative act, presents the following differences:
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   (a) It is not sufficient in cooperation such as PEEA. ("Anyone who works"), but it is required to cooperate intentionally (as if it could work together… .. negligence) “betrayal”, that is, this cooperation is done in a manner that is considered 'intentionally treacherous with the enemy' . So the National Unity Government with the Left holding six ministries (including Al.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   And b) It is not enough to have a treacherous cooperation, but it is necessary to have a result, that is, the benefit of the same (only to the same, not even in a third, eg in some of its interests) or damage to the national and allied struggle. or to Greek citizens or to the citizens of a state of state.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   These restrictions were not mitigated despite the detailed indicative interpretation of the following article of the editorial act, which standardized various ways of committing the offense. It is still noteworthy among many others is the establishment of a six -month limitation period (Article 8) of the projected offenses if not filed, with the commencement of the Germans' withdrawal.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Both the characterization of cooperation as a treacherous, as well as the requirement to cause damage to the state or the benefit of the cooperative itself, particularly narrowed the objective status of the offense of the doctrines and paved the way for the special courts of doctrines for their acquittal.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The same editorial act formed the Special Courts, which were responsible for the trial of these offenses. He was seven, with one judge, two officers and four jurors selected by special directories.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   But let's come back to the concept of the dossi and the reasons for its choice.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The term eventually appears to have been chosen by criterion:
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   a) From the Left to emphasize legal and by rules of law,
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   (b) From the Right and the forces of the anti -communist front to show that they do not protect the German associates.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Of course, the ideological impact of the term in favor of the defendants was obvious: downgrading the moral and political depreciation of their actions and their consequences, rendering presumption of innocence, degradation to a simple management pendulum instead of punishing cooperation, difficulties in the field. More, in the proof of what the editorial act and legal inadequacy of betrayal or cooperation, which could in itself be and should be an element of the establishment of the crime.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   What has led the left to the choice of this term and to capitulate the acceptance of this editorial act? The answer is political and cannot be sought elsewhere, except to the co -ordinating illusions that came from perceptions of bourgeois -democratic transformation as a necessary stage before the socialist revolution and which were expressed, in particular, in the liberation struggle with the choice of government cooperation with urban cooperation. Forces, which would be freely elected by the state and after the political issue, instead of the direct seizure of power despite the assistance of the terms and military and politically socially.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The ideological -political marking of the word "biogens", in conjunction with the legal status mentioned above, but mainly with the strong political pressure after the defeat of the start of the civil war and much more as time went on, led to the spectacular results recorded by the above books. the acquittal of the vast majority of the dozens. According to some of the rich elements of the above books:
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   For twenty thousand (20,000) lawsuits against dossia in Athens and Piraeus, 16,700 exemptions (84%) were issued and 3,227 referrals (16%) were ordered.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Of the 3,227 references, 2,251 resulted in acquittal and 976 condemnation.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Of the 976 convictions, 420 were in absentia and were then canceled when the convicts chose to appear and display obstacles that prevented them from appearing in court.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   While, out of the 556s, 243 were received by the penalty, 312 were sentenced to sentences of a few months up to five years and only two were executed.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   So few and so little paid for their crimes. And many have afterwards as businessmen and politicians, with the flag of anti -communism and national pride.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The Greek justice sealed with its behavior a huge and deep sense of injustice that has those who lived and those who still study the story of that period. And there was the greatest link in the impunity of the far -right, fascist and Nazi criminal violence, which had begun in the 1930s with "3E", and after the Dosiologists continued against the crimes of the post -war statement, such as the murder of Green but also the junta associates with the "instant". We are optimistic that the historical conviction of the Nazi criminal organization "Golden Dawn" will finally overthrow the cycle of injustice and impunity.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   However, the story of the doctrines was not over with their trials. Folk culture has written its own story with social experience regardless of what has been formulated in legal texts, since the evolution of popular culture is a construction of the class struggle and has its own autonomous and imposing contribution to the formation and defining concepts. What the left hesitated to legislate and then did not want the power of the Greek state to act on them (both in government, and in its military and judicial form) was done by the evolution of class struggle and popular culture that shaped it. And who has delivered to the present -day generation the word "biogens" with such disrespectful content that on the one hand, its synonym is well known with the word "traitors" or "collaborators" rather than its bourgeoisie in accordance with the above. In all dictionaries, if one searches for the word "doctrines" today, he will meet both concepts. And even with the concept of traitor - partner, despite the legal code. And even an ideological and political and political parties to the Right, if one describes a dossi, even he will be misunderstood and scold. So their conviction in the verdict of the Greek people is now much more worthy of their exemption in the extraordinary (and unfortunately mixed) courts in the period after 1944. And it is what it remained.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The justice of history once again defeated the injustice of power.

 Infinite respect for the inexplicable pain but also the attempt to transcend personal mourning can only feed every worker, every young person or young who demonstrated about the crime in Tempi against Maria Karystinou.

</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
 And it is beyond any objection that relatives of the victims do the obvious since it is a mass crime.
 <br>
<br>
 No progressive man can but "feast" the emptiness of the judicial power and its unraveling by publicizing the Dialogues of the Supreme Court of the "Little Ethical Issue".
 <br/>
<br/>
 The popular requirement of the culprits of the - timeless - crime is not to be paid by the culprits ...
 <br/>
<br/>
 Nor can you collect signatures as a weapon integrated into the general popular mobilization can also be underestimated…
 <br/>
<br/>
 Personally, I have used the weapon of signatures when we had to ask the Board of Directors of Associations for example, general assemblies and is also known from History that you have even executed Communist youths who were collecting signatures for peace ...
 <br/>
<br/>
 Finally, it is not negligible to concentrate more than a million signatures to remove MPs' political immunity and the constitutional review.
 <br/>
<br/>
 And of course the most good intentions of those who are rushing to sign ... but for the good intentions the well -known saying is true.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But it is there that issues are beginning to raise the prospects of the popular demand and the realistic terms that will make it fulfilled.
 <br/>
<br/>
 This is not the first time the people have found the question of lifting political immunity and purification. Remember the - not so - distant 1989? Remember what was shown (and by whom) during the Memorandums for the "politicians to pay" etc?
 <br/>
<br/>
 The same applies to the constitutional review and how the regime forces use it to impose more reactionary arrangements and directions (always under the thought of "punishment" that supposedly must fall as a rod).
 <br/>
<br/>
 On the other hand, the European Parliament's involvement for the "rule of law" in Greece, the hearings of the murdered Martha Karystinos, and all these European sensitivities probably have the horizon of French frigates sales frustrations (it is no coincidence that the parliamentary group Macron's party was the pioneer in the complaint).
 <br/>
<br/>
 Why if things were different and there was a real interest why the European Parliament was not moved on the complaints of the Italian Railway Company who "took over" the sold OSE?
 <br/>
<br/>
 It was not known that the "good luck to the Greeks" wrote by Swiss journalists when it became known that the Italian company would come to Greece (a few accidents and derailments in Switzerland where the Italian company was active).
 <br/>
<br/>
 Didn't they be interested in going for their money (us) for so many years that they were supposedly modernizing the rail network when they were dogs to get back subsidies from farmers etc?
 <br/>
<br/>
 Did the pain of the victims and the ... fair? Who; Those who consider legal defense in Genocide in Palestine?
 <br/>
<br/>
 And we come to the point.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Under the pressure of the Great Popular Mobilization on the streets and the (almost) general strike but also the steady and unshakable will of the relatives of the murdered victims by publicizing their own independent research of experts, the government and the system are attempting a disorienting shift:
 <br/>
<br/>
 Shortly before the parliamentary process for Tempi was finally closed (which the KKE had so… innocent and accepted by the government, let's not forget!) The well -known prosecutor who was fasting and prayer for the "small moral issue" is finally moving the process.
 <br/>
<br/>
 And the vomiting paparazzi through the old fox hieronymus accepts the demand for the bells of all temples 57 times mournful. It is the only disturbance of quiet that the exclusive representatives of the heavenly paradise in the earthly hell that they call on the peoples to live and accept by silence ...
 <br/>
<br/>
 Those who are aware of legal proceedings predict that the final trial of the -who are -in -law is going to be delayed or otherwise. That is, there will be enough time to convene the case and remain in the legal uninformed the real culprits now and the system managers.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Time - and especially when popular reactions on the streets - is always an ally of the social regime.
 <br/>
<br/>
 And two more foods for thought:
 <br/>
<br/>
 How different would things be if half of the almost one and a half millions of signed (what actual costs a signature on its own?) Strike and went down the road on 28/2?
 <br/>
<br/>
 How different direction of life and a corresponding political act represents what Manna Karystinos herself "confessed" to the journalist's joint question what she would consider justification for her murdered daughter:
 <br/>
<br/>
 "But never happen again"!
 <br/>
<br/>
 Do not resurrect these or other suffering crimes of the system at the expense of youth and workers is not on any legal agenda.
 <br/>
<br/>
 You will not find it in the parliamentary proposals of the parties that want to refer to the Left but however help to disseminate and consolidate a delusion.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Because it is a delusion that this system can be attributed to justice for its ... victims. And any exception to this rule is not related to parliamentary or constitutional processes and revisions.
 <br/>
<br/>
 To "not re -happen" the new crimes that the system already produces and reproduces massively (see what is happening in health) is another matter.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It is included in the "agenda" of demands imposed and claimed by the popular struggle on the offshore "sidewalk" (to remember the saying of the great nationalist and uncle of the resigned Minister of Transport and Railway Crimes).

 While many Palestinians have fled the invasion in the north of the enclave, it is believed that a few hundred thousand have remained in the region largely devastated and isolated. Several aid deliveries have reached the area this week, the officials said.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Humanitarian groups affirm that it has become almost impossible to deliver supplies in most of Gaza due to the difficulty of coordinating with the Israeli army, the current hostilities and the collapse of public order, with crowds of desperate people who overwhelm humanitarian convoys . The UN states that a quarter of the 2.3 million Palestinians from Gaza risks hunger; About 80% fled their homes.
 </p>
<p>
  Kamel Abu Nahel, who was being treated for a gunshot wound at the Shifa hospital, said he and others went to the distribution point in the middle of the night because they had heard that there would be a delivery of food.

  , he said.
 </p>
<p>
  He said the Israeli troops opened fire on the crowd while people pulled out flour boxes and canned food with trucks, making them disperse, and some hid under the cars. After the shots have ceased, people returned to the trucks and the soldiers opened the fire again. They shot him on a leg and fell, then a truck passed over his leg as he darted, he said.
 </p>
<p>
  The doctors who arrived on the scene of the bloodshed on Thursday on Thursday found "dozens or hundreds" lying on the ground, according to Fares Afana, head of the ambulance service of the Kamal Adwan hospital. He said there were not enough ambulances to collect all the deaths and injuries and that some were brought to hospitals on donkeys towed by donkeys.

</p>
<p>
  The
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle in Defense of the Rights of the People
  </strong>
  is coming, which our organization will carry out on March 4 in Oaxaca under the slogans: “
  <strong>
   Stop the war against the people!
  </strong>
  ” and “
  <strong>
   Don’t vote, organize and fight!
  </strong>
  ”. This
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle
  </strong>
  is important because it is taking place in a context of increased repression and criminalization against the popular movement in the state, where the self-proclaimed “Oaxacan spring” has shown its true face by beating and evicting residents in Salina Cruz and railroad retirees in Matias Romero; imprisoning residents of Mixtequilla and sentencing the community agent of Puente Madera to 46 years in jail, all of them for opposing the imposition of the Inter-Oceanic Corridor; and now also with the armed eviction of artisans and merchants adhering to the Red Sun People’s Current in the Santo Domingo church, which took place on the 17th of February in the middle of the city of resistance. We cannot forget that the demands for justice of our democratic organization have not been resolved, such as the presentation of comrade Dr. Ernesto Sernas García alive, the punishment of the material and intellectual authors of the murders of our comrades Luis Armando Fuentes Aquino, Jesús Manuel García Martínez and Félix Vicente Cruz; the freedom and acquittal of Salvador Pinal Meléndez; the fulfillment of recommendations 05/2018 and 01/2023; in addition to the precautionary measures for the Triqui families displaced from San Miguel Copala, among others of a social nature in the face of the non-fulfillment of fundamental rights that allow us to assure:
  <strong>
   In Oaxaca there is no justice, much less transformation!
  </strong>
  Thus, while the state government launches fascist warnings of “we talk, we don’t blockade,” the heroic Section XXII of the SNTE-CNTE has paralyzed the state on the 19th and 26th of February, respectively, with a series of vigorous road blockades demanding the reinstatement of the national dialogue table between the presidency of the republic and the CNTE to attend to the most heartfelt demands of the democratic teachers and school communities. Now it is the turn of our democratic organization that will begin with this first phase of mobilizations of resistance in the city as part of a plan of action on a larger scale, fulfilling the revolutionary order:
  <strong>
   Flood the streets and squares with red flags!
  </strong>

  </em>
  activist and responsible for organizing the guerrilla movement in the Northwest of Rio Grande do Sul, Fortini was directly involved in the armed struggle against the military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Always living in a simple and reclusive way, the Italian never spoke about his past, at least not to anyone he exposed to the public today. What is known about Fortini is that he comes from the Veneto region, in Italy. In a statement in 2014, he said that “
  <strong>
   the experience I had as a child where huge, well-armed columns of Germans and fascists were practically attacked”
  </strong>
  . He joined his father, an Italian guerrilla leader, in operations against the fascists.
 </p>
<p>
  In the 1960s, he reappeared in Passo Fundo as a street vendor. When armed resistance against the military regime intensified, Fontini quickly became involved with the revolutionary organizations of Passo Fundo, the VPR and the POC
  <em>
   [Translator’s note: Communist Workers Party]
  </em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
  quickly becoming a regional leader of the VPR, responsible for the regional revolutionary court and becoming involved in the work of propaganda, mainly among student circles.
 </p>
<p>
  When Captain Carlos Lamarca deserted the reactionary army and joined the guerrilla, the VPR’s initial idea was for him to take refuge on the border with Argentina, in the cities of Três Passos and Tenente Portela. Fortini was the great organizer of the guerrilla infrastructure in the region, preparing the ground for Lamarca’s arrival. The plan, however, did not succeed. In 1970, reactionary intelligence investigated the ‘Sociedade Pesqueira do Alto Uruguai Ltda.’ VPR front company for which Fortini was responsible, due to “suspected smuggling”. The justification was a lie. The reactionary military had been monitoring the supposed company for a long time.
 </p>
<p>
  In prison, Fortini was arrested along with many other comrades and brutally tortured. He says he was threatened with being deported back to Italy and given to the mafia. It was during one of these torture sessions with electric shocks that Fortini lost the ability to speak fluent Portuguese. Until the end of his life, he began to mix the language with Spanish and also Italian.
 </p>
<p>
  Fortini was released in 1971, along with 70 other political prisoners, in exchange for the freedom of Swiss ambassador Giovanni Bucher, kidnapped by the VPR. Once again, Fortini’s story becomes obscure, and he begins to live clandestinely with his partner Nádia and their adopted son in a VPR base somewhere in Missões, in Argentina. The place where he lived until his death, under a false name and always stating that he did not live in his house, but in a VPR support base. On 17
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February of 2024, at the age of 87, his heart stopped beating, but Fortini’s memory always lives on, like every great fighter of the people, it is immortal.

</p>
<p>
  Recently,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/entrevista-trabalhadores-da-saude-de-amazonas-prometem-intensas-mobilizacoes/">
   the Brazilian newspaper A Nova Democracia (AND)
  </a>
  made an interview with health sector workers in the federal state of Amazonas. The interview was made with Mauro Bastos, leader of the Everyone for Health Movement, and was in Manaus, capital of the State of Amazonas. The health sector’s workers are experiencing very bad working conditions with super-exploitation, low salaries, lack of rights, etc. In Amazonas specifically, they define the situation as a “truly calamitous scenario”.
 </p>
<p>
  During the interview Mauro values that there are professionals of all categories who are privatized, without receiving their salary for 7 months. In the case of public workers, many are threatened, morally harassed, overloaded with work. He ends up defining the general situation as “a true chaos”, pointing directly to those responsible for the old Brazilian State, since none of them solve anything of this bad situation.
 </p>
<p>
  As for the Everyone for Health Movement itself, which Mauro leads, it is in a framework of large mobilizations and demonstrations for health in Amazonas in the recent years. Specifically, the Everyone for Health Movement began in 2019, initiated by Dênis, in the context of the Covid-19 crisis when many coworkers were overloaded, there was not enough staff hired and many coworkers from several different units decided to begin the struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  Regarding the unions present in the area, which the interviewed calls “traditional unions”, Mauro explains that they are not against the government, and that they should go in favor of the worker. But the reality is that they are practically on the side of the government and receive orders from it.
 </p>
<p>
  As for the founder of the movement, Dênis, he suffers persecution, and has suffered it since he started the movement until today. Even though, the perspective that the leader Mauro Bastos presents is the struggle, and the continuation of it until the resolution of all the problems and injustices they suffer. The leader of the Movement summarizes it in the following way:
  <em>
   “As long as there is a colleague, even just one, going through persecution, coercion, harassment, without pay
  </em>
<em>
   ment
  </em>
<em>
   , mistreated by managers or even by the system, we will always be there to help, do you understand
  </em>
<em>
   it
  </em>
<em>
   ?”
  </em>
  . [Translator’s note: all translations made by us based on his answers are unofficial.]
 </p>
<p>
  At the end of the interview, the leader Mauro Bastos addresses all health workers and readers of A Nova Democracia with a powerful and clear message of struggle:
  <em>
   “This is very nice, but I also want to tell my colleagues of profession, to all employees in the health sector, that they must not accept, they must not accept being humiliated, they must not accept being coerced or even harassed. They must always be in the struggle, always demanding what is their right. (…) For this reason, my dears, we will always be in the struggle, we will always seek our achievements, we will seek what we deserve. And thank you very much to all.”
  </em>

</p>
<p>
  Rona Wilson is one of the activists behind bars due to the BK16 case, targeted for his activism and anti-fascist intervention. …
 </p>
<p>
  Questioning the nature of Indian democracy is not new to Rona, with his activism around political prisoners being centred around the undemocratic nature of the “anti-terror” law in India. Rona was a founding member of the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP) and serves as its Public Relations Secretary. …
 </p>
<p>
  Along with the famed author-activist Arundhati Roy, Rona was also a member of the Committee for the Defense and Release of GN Saibaba and has been working on the issue of political prisoners since the early 2000s. …
 </p>
<p>
  Rona was arrested from his Delhi home on 6
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  June 2018, along with 4 other activists on the same day- Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut and Shoma Sen. All five were accused of having links with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and charged under various sections of the UAPA. However, the state had particularly targeted Rona Wilson …
 </p>
<p>
  The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has accused Rona of trying to create disturbances in India since they have seized some documents from him which talk about how oppressed groups like Dalits and Muslims must join hands in the formation of an anti-fascist united front to strengthen the mass mobilisation of people. For this reason, the police singled out Rona for conspiring to assassinate prime Minister Narendra Modi, based on the claims of the police of having found a letter amongst Rona’s possessions…
 </p>
<p>
  Years after his unjust arrest, Arsenal Consulting analysed the electronic copies of the computers of co-defendants Rona and Surendra at the request of the defense team. Arsenal Consulting (a Massachusetts-based digital forensics firm) had stated that an attacker used malware to infiltrate Wilson’s laptop and deposited at least ten incriminating letters on it. These included a purported letter to a Maoist militant discussing the need for guns and ammunition, and even urging the banned group to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 </p>
<p>
  A year later, a report was released by the Washington Post revealing that Rona was targeted by two separate groups of hackers before he was arrested. … ModifiedElephant, the main hacker, sent emails with documents or attachments – laden with commercially available malware like NetWire and DarkComet — that were tailored to the victim’s interests and were often copied to multiple recipients they knew, SentinelOne said. Wilson received at least 32 emails from ModifiedElephant, and Gadling was the recipient of 40 such mails from the group.
 </p>
<p>
  … Three independent experts in the United States and Europe reviewed the SentinelOne report at The Post’s request and concurred with its conclusions. Concerningly, the researchers said that the earliest attack on Wilson can be traced back to a decade ago, though the email attacks intensified in 2014 and continued until at least 2016.
 </p>
<p>
  … The state has painted him so, like they have painted those who fight against injustice, for hope, as terrorists, as anti-nationals. The question remains- whose nation? In a country which is itself a prison house of nationalities, are we to accept the state’s agenda of establishing a Hindu Rashtra? Are we to accept a “nation” built on the blood of Muslims, of Adivasis, of oppressed castes, of women and other oppressed groups? Are we to accept a nation which throws its most patriotic, country-loving people into jail for having a voice, albeit one which speaks to the people, of their demands, instead of the chauvinistic and reactionary agenda of the state? No, we cannot accept this as a country. We cannot accept anything but the unconditional release of Comrade Rona, of the release of all political prisoners who fight selflessly for us.

  Darmstadt | 25.02.2023 | Political scientist and researcher Writer Volkan Yaraşır and Atik Co -Chairman Süleyman Gürcan participated as a speaker. In the first part of the panel, which was held as two parts, the speakers evaluated the history of the Middle East geography and peoples from the historical process to this day.
 </div>
<div>
  The imperialists' ambition of saturated market, the attractiveness of the underground natural riches, the characteristics of the geographical position of the geographical location of a continuous war area, the brutally, brutal blood, tears drowned in a geography, and even more savage was grown.
 </div>
<div>
  On October 7, 2023, under the leadership of Kassam Brigades, the Zionist Israeli state was also evaluated. It was stated that this action was manipulated by the imperialists consciously and left in the shadow of the reactionary Hamas organization, with which Zionist Israel and its supporters were asked to hide the genocide crime committed by the US and European imperialists, and the rightful resistance of the Filstin people wanted to be terrorized. It was emphasized that we should condemn the attacks on the civilian Hamas organization and that the right to criticize the reactionary Hamas organization was a part of the liberation struggle of the Palestinian people.
 </div>
<div>
  In the second part, the panel was terminated as an enthusiastic and highly efficient interview with the questions, opinions and evaluations of the audience.

  Stuttgart | 29.02.2024 | In the morning of February 27, dozens of people were detained in the operation carried out by the fascist Turkish state in Istanbul and Izmir for left, socialist institutions and people. Following the detention, protest actions were organized in order to react to the operation in many places. Within the framework of these actions, an action was held in Stuttgart on Tuesday, February 27 with the call of the European Democratic Power Union. In a statement made by ADGB, it was emphasized that the detention attacks that took place before the March 8 International Working Women's Day and March 31 local elections were an intimidation of revolutionary and united struggle forces. In the continuation of the statement, these attacks could not be subjugated to the left, socialist forces, and these attacks will be wasted by the united struggle. After the announcement, the action was terminated by shouting slogans of solidarity with the detainees.

   The National Government, chaired by Javier Milei and Victoria Villarruel, in just over two months has greatly deepened the sufferings of the Argentine people.
  </p>
<p>
   In the specific case of public education, it has decided to stop turning the budget items for education to each province: the National Teaching Incentive Fund (FONID), connectivity, salary compensatory fund and other education items (pedagogical programs, school dining rooms and Cup of milk, progress, connect equality and school infrastructure).
  </p>
<p>
   It also eliminates the institutional improvements plan of technical schools and budgetary lines, which are fundamental for its operation. And refuses to convene the National Teaching Parity.
  </p>
<p>
   These are the causes that explain the national unemployment of Ctera on February 26, date on which the school cycle 10 educational jurisdictions began.
  </p>
<p>
   The forcefulness of the call to the National Teaching strike by all the centrals led the National Government to summon the guilds to a meeting, without it having the character of the national parity claimed. Ctera decides to hold it despite the call.
  </p>
<p>
   Even so,
   <strong>
    To that meeting the National Government was without any response to the teaching demands of education funds.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Given this situation, the national teaching unions nucleated in the CGT, call a national strike on March 4.
  </p>
<p>
   We consider that being the same claims that gave rise to the national unemployment of Ctera on Monday 26, we call on all the other national and provincial unions to converge in the 4th unemployment and in all the measures that arise from now on (8 and 24 March and April 2, on the way to a great federal march adding to the university unions) and to make the highest efforts to strengthen unity to face the policies of adjustment and delivery of this reactionary and fascist government.

  Like all in our America we know [and we clearly suffer] Yankee imperialism has imposed the greatest militarization of lackeys under their control. This need, as well as the tendency towards the facission and reacting of regimes under their splint, is born from the fear that imperialism has before its general crisis and the growth in the struggles of the peoples in the world. The above applies not only outside the imperialist powers, but also inside. Citing a

  From a nova democracy that we recently shared: “Hence the political reflexes perceived year after year. Knowing that the unresolved crisis of its regime tends to arouse increasingly powerful uprisings of the popular masses, as has happened incessantly in recent years, the ruling classes use repression as the only alternative. Only in the last two years, countries such as France or the United Kingdom have used or advanced measures and bills to restrict rights as basic as strikes and popular street demonstrations. Throughout Europe, militarization advances at a fast pace: in addition to increasing military budget, organizations such as NATO welcomed Finland as new members in 2023. ”

  The Georgia State Police and especially Atlanta was the awkward witness of the 2020 mobilizations against racism and police violence, which increased after the news of the murder of Georges Flyod, who was publicly suffocating it by the racist police until the racist police until his death. As the masses lazar furiously, the fear of the Poli grew overflowing.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  In Atlanta this movement continues to increase after the murder of Rayshard Brooks, another black worker massacred by the police during an arrest, in which Brooks resisted trying to avoid being tortured with a taser. He was killed with multiple bullets while trying to flee.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  These struggles and the resistance of the masses in the streets have exceeded the police again and again and are the justification of the gringo imperialist state to build the “Atlanta Public Safety Training Center” complex (Atlanta Public Security Training Center) In the forest, south of the city that in its history has not only for genocide and forced displacement against the people

  The people of Atlanta have immediately stood up against this project, joining different initiatives against the formation of a police state and internal militarization. The different agendas in forest protection, against gentrification, police violence, etc. They have joined a variety of heterogeneous groups and individuals who already develop various campaigns with mass struggle that range from the forest, to the realization of marches and sabotage against machinery and equipment of the megaproject construction companies, after which the FBI and Police have made cateos and raids amid spectacular operations as taken from a gringa film.

  The latter gives us an exact panorama of the anti-democratic character of the project and confirms the reactionary vocation of the gringo government, who threatens to destroy the social fabric and peace of the African-American communities around the place, and of the same population originally from the forest. In the same way, more than 116,000 signatures (more than twice the votes that the governor of Atlanta received in the past election) were ignored for being “late”, although a judge had ordered a extended extent in the search for signatures that were oppose the project.

  The opposition to this megaproject has left some costs, at the moment 61 activists are accused in a criminal process based on “rich” laws approved in the 70s against organized crime. They are accused of being part of an "organization in fact" and not of a movement, in addition the State considers this "organization" as a criminal for the simple fact of protesting under common slogans or names of initiatives such as "high to the police city "Or" defend the Atlanta forest. " Forty -two of these are accused of domestic terrorism for participating in marches or camps, many of them are also charged within the first process.

  At the moment the State achieved the eviction of the forest and has begun the construction of the “Cop City”, but the fight continues and is not lost.

  It is obvious and well understood by the movement that the “police city” project also has relevance outside Atlanta. Citing a representative of the White House, who considers “exemplary” this megaproject that “would like to see emulated by other municipalities” is a proof that it is a pilot project; That is why in other states of the country there are protests and sabotage actions against monopoly companies and public administration.

  Many groups in protests denounce the role of Yankee imperialism in militarization and wars against peoples worldwide, now especially the training of Zionist pigs and gringa participation in genocide in Palestine. It is increasingly frequent to observe the claims in favor of the heroic Palestinian national resistance with slogans and flags present in the manifestations against “Cop City”.

  The tendency towards the formation of a police state and militarization in the heart of the imperialist Yankee beast shows the severity of its crisis. His democratic mask is falling apart. Yankee imperialism wants to save himself in blood the rebellion of the masses, but they will fail and will be swept by this. We greet the resistance of the people in the US struggling against the same beast side by side with the oppressed peoples of the world.
