I am an active member of the United States Air Forces and I will not continue to be an accomplice of a genocide. I am about to participate in an extreme act of protest, but compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it is not extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided to be normal. \u201dAll this while walking to the front of the Israel Embassy in Washington for seconds later, spraying the body with some fuel and caught fire while listening to its repeated and agonizing cry of \"free Palestine!\", While he was being pointed with a gun by a guard, who did not even try to turn it off. It must be remembered that, in December 2023, another protester was immolated in front of the Israeli consulate in Atlanta, Georgia, a place where a Palestinian flag was found as part of the protest.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   These types of individual actions express a deep disagreement with what is happening at a given time, in this case, evidence the rejection of genocide against the people of Palestine; But also, it is an expression of individual despair that can cause a massacre like the one committed by Zionism and Yankee imperialism. The peculiar in this case is that an active military of the US armed forces, who participate in the execution of the massacre against the Gaza Strip and other countries in the area, is done, which shows that there is no strong unit of will , nor of action within those criminal armed forces of the Yankees genocids. The spirit of \"railway unity\" of the imperialist armed forces that try to disseminate in the main media, is false, because, while the high political and military commanders send to commit crimes against humanity to their troops, within them, it grows discontent and indignation for being sent to kill innocent people throughout the Middle East, especially in Palestine. Although, it cannot be affirmed that this type of acts have been generalized, or that the troop is insubordinate, it is very telling that a military like Aaron Bushnell has made the decision to end his life in that way.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Rebellion and disobedience must grow between the troop when they are sent to end the life of thousands of innocent, refusing to fulfill the orders of their superiors if they endanger the life of the disarmed people. This is possible because even within the military institutions of the bourgeois state, there is the class struggle that is reflected in the deep contradiction that is generated when a handful of high controls that live in ease, with privileges, good food and dress, schedules of preferential work, etc., in opposition, to most ranks of the bourgeois armies in which hundreds of thousands of soldiers are sent to the field of operations to expose their lives in exchange for very little and to defend class interests that They do not represent them. The rebellion is justified! Even inside the reactionary armed forces and enemies to the revolutionary proletariat in which their ranks must be divided, breaking their struggle of struggle and making it into account that what they are doing is a butcher shop is a butcher shop No control against the innocent people.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Other ways in which the military can manifest discontent with the genocide that Israel's Zionism is committing in Palestine, can be, acting clandestinely by sending military weapons to resistance in Palestine, hacking the communications of the powers involved in the Matanza against the people, sharing valuable information to the revolutionaries or if you want, turning their rifles against the high military commanders, or simply, refusing to pull the trigger against the innocent people.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In the ranks of the enemy armed forces to the proletariat, it is necessary that the revolutionaries do political work of revolutionary organization, forming political cells that serve the construction of that revolutionary organization that the working class in Colombia needs so much. It touches the communists to make conscious with the science of the proletariat, the spontaneous rebellion of the masses, so that instead of the soldiers and police officers, a great massive, political and military movement of revolutionary organization is generated in the armies of the armies of The reactionary classes that serve the violent destruction of the bourgeois-terrarate state to build on its ruins the new state of workers and peasants, in which the armed masses will be the ones that decide for themselves, the fate of that new socialist society.\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://revolucionobrera.com/internacional/aaron-bushnell/", "type": "article", "title": "Aaron Bushnell, the soldier who was immolated in support of Palestine | Workers Revolution", "description": "It was widely known how the specialist in cyber defense operations Aaron Bushnell, an active member of the Air Force was immolated", "author": ["Revoluci\u00f3n Obrera"], "tags": ["Aaron Bushnell", "Estado sionista de Israel", "Estados Unidos", "Fuerza A\u00e9rea", "Fuerzas Militares", "Israel", "Palestina", "Palestina Libre"], "section": "Internacional"}
