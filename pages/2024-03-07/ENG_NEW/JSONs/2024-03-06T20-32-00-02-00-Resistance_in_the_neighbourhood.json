Saybaba for the accusations by which he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He ruled that the evidence that had associated him with the illegal CC India (Maoist) and were built by the police authorities were unfounded and even violated these so -called anti -terrorist laws and that the decision of the 2017 Primary Court in 2017.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The acquittal of Siebaba and his five co -defendant comrades is the second in a row, after that of October 2022 with the same, up and down. And then, like now, the reactionary government of the Maharastra State in cooperation with the federal, in New Delhi, had appealed against it, resulting in the fighter remaining in prison in harsh conditions, leading him to confident physical extermination. Already one of the five detainees Pandu Narote died in prison on August 25, 2022.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The announcement of the second acquittal, which is a blatant for the reactionary forces in India, was welcomed by the organizations and solidarity movements in the country and internationally demanding this time the court ruling be respected and the fighter to be released immediately!\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["\u03b4\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03b7", "\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1", "GN Saibaba"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/gn.html"}
