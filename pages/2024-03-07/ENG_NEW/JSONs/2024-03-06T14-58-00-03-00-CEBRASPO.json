The activists participated in the taking of Santa Elina Farm, the scene of the Battle of Corumbiara, and had been arrested by the PM of Rond\u00f4nia on May 14, 2021, accused of illegal gun and radio transmitters during an illegal operation against the camp. At the time, the League of Poor Peasants characterized the arrest as political persecution, denouncing that the only source for the legal process was testimonials of military police.\n   </p>\n   <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n    At the time, the PM of Rond\u00f4nia was directed by Jos\u00e9 H\u00e9lio Cysneiros Pach\u00e1 (known as \u201cThe Holy Elina Carnage\u201d) chosen by the Bolly Churcher Governor Colonel Marcos Rocha.

The defense denounced that the weapon found with the four was a blatant forged by the police to criminalize the struggle for the land, but had not had any analysis by the judiciary. In addition to ignoring the illegality that the only witness heard was the police themselves, the weapon that was allegedly in possession of one of the activists was used to convict activists in state courts.\n   </p>\n   <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n    With the new understanding of the MPF, it will be possible to question the conviction, requesting a criminal review that Abrapo considers \u201cquite promising\u201d.\n   </p>\n   <p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>\n    A\n    <a data-id=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C3_sHaXtdUM/\" data-type=\"link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C3_sHaXtdUM/\" rel=\"noopener\" style=\"background-color: transparent; box-shadow: none; box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration-line: none;\" target=\"_blank\">\n     use\n    </a>\n    It concludes by stating that \"this is an important victory for the collective struggle, the lawyers of the people, Abrapo, Cebraspo, newspaper and, and all the supporters of the struggle for the land for those who live and work in it.\"\n   </p>\n   <span style='background-color: white; color: #121212; font-family: \"roboto serif\", sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>\n    <br/>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; vertical-align: inherit;\">\n   <br/>\n  </span>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "Brazilian Center for Solidarity to Peoples is a democratic entity that aims to defend the right of the people to fight for their rights.", "author": ["CEBRASPO"], "source": "https://cebraspo.blogspot.com/2024/03/contra-criminalizacao-da-luta-pela.html"}
