This need to bring them to the present has to do with that unity action they had but also with behaviors, with principles, with commitments and convictions. Ren\u00e9 Salamanca apart from having an incredible leader as a leader, as the fellow Luna said, which has to do with respect for the decision of the bases, with the exercise of true union democracy, but also with political clarity. He had the political clarity of defining what was coming, on March 24 it was the one who suffered the first consequences of what this coup d'etat of 1976 meant, that political clarity that accompanied him all his short life, left us this need to be put into practice the exercise of that action that we have to claim every day. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Arnoldo G\u00f3mez closed the act by raising \u201cWhat did Otto Vargas, C\u00e9sar Gody \u00c1lvarez, Atilio L\u00f3pez, Agust\u00edn Tosco and Ren\u00e9 Salamanca, who thought different He made the CCC in Villa Libertador, see the list and the tail of neighbors who came to look for their daily food have to rebel any Argentine with dignity. They had this outrage to change the situation of their people and for rebelling in front of this. This is the main thing that we must inherit from them, it is the rebellion that already appeared here with the unemployment of 24, because it will not be contemplating that we are going to face this but standing up, facing each of the measures that this government is taking \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u201cMilei removes the funds for any of the popular needs that there are today, there is no money, how is there no money? In less than two months the Central Bank has gathered 8,000 million dollars, where they left, but what the Argentines produced? And that the bank bought issuing tickets and that they pay the interests of the Leliq, is the silver they have taken out of our pockets, is the silver that they challenge to the provinces. There is another way, it is for which we have to generate the conditions of change to be produced: the road is the inverse, those millions of dollars that are gathering to pay the IMF must cease the payment that Argentina is bleeding, and The weights that are being used to pay financial usury have to go to production, consumption, salaries. They are annihilating our production day by day and will make necessary every day that the people join to oppose this. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The national deputy Gabriela Est\u00e9vez, the provincial legislator Federico Alessandri, Mariana Mandakovic of the CTA, the current of state current Ren\u00e9 Salamanca and Malvina Toscco were sent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   To close the act, the new commemorative plaque was discovered, in the square that bears his name, next to the Permanent Tribute Commission to Ren\u00e9 Salamanca.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Correspondent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Today N \u00b0 2001 03/06/2024\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n </div>\n <!-- .entry-content -->\n</div>\n", "source": "https://pcr.org.ar/nota/gran-homenaje-a-rene-salamanca-2/", "type": "article", "title": "Great tribute to Ren\u00e9 Salamanca", "description": "Before the offensive wave against freedoms, human rights and denial to the state genocide of the coup of 1976, remember our class and revolutionary leader, Ren\u00e9 Salamanca becomes more validity than ever.
