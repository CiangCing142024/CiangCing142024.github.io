 <p>
  Yesterday the military mission was voted in Parliament in the Red Sea to which 
 Italy participates: the Aspides mission which would have, according to the 
 government declarations, the aim of protecting the commercial streets 
 and to protect the Italian ships operating in the area.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Protect them 
 from who? from the attack that is charged to the "Houthi rebels", 
 or to the armed forces of the South Yemen, who started 
 actually a military action of obstacle of commercial ships, 
 military, who pass through the Red Sea, from which, according to when it comes 
 Declared, 15% of global trade circulates.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Why 
 he did it? By solidarity with the attacked Palestinian people, 
 massacred and victim of a genocidal plan by the state 
 Nazi's Zionist of Israel. A genocidal plan that has 
 so far caused over 30,000 deaths, of which about half women e 
 children; who destroyed houses, hospitals, structures of all kinds, 
 of civil life in Palestine.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That 
 forced and forces the Palestinian people to abandon the 
 Strip of Gaza, pushed towards an exodus and a deportation that 
 Remember that of the Nazis against the Jews during the second 
 world War.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That 
 He did not hesitate to shoot - and to kill - against the masses 
 hungry reduced to the bread and had to have it help 
 Humanitaries of UN missions, etc. etc. Israel shot on women and 
 children. This crime against humanity is the ongoing genocide 
 towards the people of Palestine, who have
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 need of solidarity 
 political-military of all the forces of the Arab masses in that area e 
 So what started and made the so -called "Houthi rebels" 
 that's what all Arab masses and all states should do 
 Arabs of the area that are said to be against the genocide in place of the 
 State of Israel and alongside the Palestinian people.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So 
 The attack of the "Houthi rebels" ("Ribelli Houthi" is one 
 simplified definition) is right and necessary, we support 
 unconditionally every action against commercial and military ships 
 of the imperialist countries that solidarize with the Zionist state of 
 Nazi of Israel type that must be attacked, hindered, because 
 This helps to stop genocidal aggression, helps to restore the 
 peace in that area, peace guaranteed only by justice for the people 
 Palestinian.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Self 
 We had the possibilities we would do a military/social contingent 
 in support of those who fight the state of Israel and imperialism that 
 supports him.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For 
 This is radically against the military, imperialist mission, 
 accomplice of the genocide, of Italy, within the framework of the European agreement, 
 With the Aspides mission which is part of a war crime, it is one 
 march towards the war against peoples within the march 
 general of the imperialist countries towards a third world war.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Everyone 
 those who say they love peace, democracy, that yes 
 declare solidarity with the Palestinian people, all those who 
 they want to cease fire in that area, all those who say 
 to be against wars, against imperialism, should oppose 
 this mission, in parliament as in the squares, which is also 
 you already do or have begun to do, especially in the great 
 Milan event of March 24th. And instead this government there 
 Drag in this infamous war, this government deploy the soldiers 
 Italians to kill and to stop those who solidarize with the people 
 Palestinian and contribute to the massacre of the Palestinian people.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 just not only to oppose this mission but that this mission 
 be hit by those who solidarize with the Palestinian people.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 our no is unconditional and in parliament, instead a 
 crime, a crime: the forces of the self -styled opposition, the Democratic Party in 
 Schlein head, which is said to be against the Meloni government that you want 
 put how to counterbalance, which also exploits the infamy of the existence of 
 This government to bring votes home, as happened in Sardinia, 
 Instead it votes in favor, or in some way it is with the government in 
 This criminal mission. And therefore in Parliament one is celebrated 
 farce, a farce warflower, an orgy of words to hide the 
 real interests that there are in this mission, which are not alone 
 war, but they are cheap, behind this mission there are the 
 profits of multinationals, i 
 profits of the war industries, a filth mission for i 
 profits, a filth mission for the war. For this it is 
 However, the Parliament is needed, which outside Parliament does 
 feel the loud and clear voice.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When 
 Imperialism and its governments speak of peace, they do it to do the 
 wars, because they are their system, their interests 
 economic behind the wars there.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  That 
 Are Italian troops in the Red Sea are doing? The Red Sea is 
 Italian?
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is colonialism, this is imperialism. The peoples 
 of the area cannot decide whether or not to stop commercial ships, 
 military in a context of a genocidal war against the people of the 
 Palestine, defined as terrorists. Terrorism are the bombs 
 of imperialism. Military actions, from Hamas to Houthi rebels, 
 I am a national liberation struggle. On this no misunderstanding can there 
 to be.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 This position is the only position that respects the interests of 
 proletarians, of the popular masses, of all those who do not want to 
 This country a world made of genocide wars, of all those who 
 they understand that it is the same government that in our country cuts the 
 citizenship income, impoverishes the poor, does nothing for 
 save work, health, health, school and instead it matters all of these 
 Money in the cauldron of military spending and military missions.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  "Raise 
 wages, lower the weapons " - it is said - but this passes through 
 exposed of this government, of this government of the war to which 
 the proletarian and popular opposition must be opposed, the other war, 
 The war of people because only the war of the people stops the wars. 
 Everyone should know by trivially reading the history books.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 Mission, however, takes place in a picture in which Italy has the 
 command, it is the usual "Pennacchi command", because 
 Italy has the command of a mission that reflects the interests 
 imperialism in general, it is alongside imperialism 
 American who has real interests and inside a mission with France and 
 Germany that are countries that have even greater interests than those 
 of Italy in the area. Therefore a mission for the masters and the 
 Italian multinationals in a picture of servants of the servants 
 of American imperialism and major imperialist powers. There 
 logic of servants has always been internal nature, nature 
 effective of all those who refer - moreover more or less 
 explicitly - in Mussolini, to fascism, they follow in the footsteps 
 neocolonial and imperialist and bring, today as then, our country 
 on the side of the barbarism, on the side of the oppression of the 
 proletarians and peoples.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 No to this mission must be really supported and is combined 
 with the support for political-military, cultural make-up, 
 Ideological and even moral of this mission.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Yes is 
 on the side of peoples and peace, if you have courage, the 
 consciousness, to say this.
