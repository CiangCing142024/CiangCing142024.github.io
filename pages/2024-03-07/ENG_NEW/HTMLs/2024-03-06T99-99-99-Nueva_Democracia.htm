  This February 24, the total war of aggression against Ukraine by Russian imperialism marks its second anniversary. This unfair war has generated hundreds of thousands of dead and injured and millions of displaced people, causing misery and pain throughout the Ukrainian people.
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e77c832158f982f019a39f37c6b321d9">
  Through the heroic defense of his homeland by the people of Ukraine, despite the national regime, headed by the Yankees Lacayo, Zelensky, the Russian aggressor so far has not been able to complete his highest war objectives.
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bf6df55cb4681e9f29eb1e7deb154585">
  It is fair and correct to reaffirm what the International Communist League said a year ago:
  <em>
   “The main contradiction is that between Ukraine, a country oppressed by imperialism, and Russia, an imperialist country. Regardless of the class character of the Ukrainian regime and its service to the interests of other imperialist powers, mainly Yankee superpower, any confusion at this point leads to Ukraine to deny Ukraine its right to national independence and sovereignty, it is therefore at least indirectly, support the interests of Russian imperialism. ”
  </em>
  as well as
  <em>
   "The long-term plan of the Yankees is to fence and in the end defeat their only nuclear equivalent and the Russian counter-remedies to resume lost positions, it is the key factor that has led to war."
  </em>
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5a238056bb58c0fe11209e06cb18d476">
  It is particularly notorious that what was written then was proven then:
  <em>
   “The Zelensky regime is put into acute contradiction with the interests of the vast majority of the Ukrainian people, trafficked with their fair patriotic feelings, applies absolute centralism and there is no kind of democratic rights for the people. The right of opinion, assembly and organization is suppressed by a draconian and chauvinist repression and the regime depends on openly fascist military formations to crush any expression of popular discontent. This sabotage the armed resistance of the people by relying on weapons, eagerly offered by NATO directed by the Yankees, fearing the armed people who are the only ones that really defend the nation. ”
  </em>
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f8260b595e77bbd2e2d3d0acc0df215b">
  This is an important fact. Because today it is clear and obvious that the main point for which the Zelensky regime is not able to defeat Russian imperialist aggression-despite the heroic sacrifices of the Ukrainian people-it is because traitors sell-patrias are supported by imperialism, mainly Yankee, and not in the town.
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e9250903c1ba51b1276105b0356b24e5">
  This is expressed, among many other things, in the case of the fall of Avdiivka, a small town in the Donetsk region. A bitter tragedy as wars write them.
  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/ukrainian-avdiivka-soldiers-messages-intl/index.html">
   How the press reports
  </a>
  , the soldiers parked there carried out desperate attempts to escape the ruins of the town. One of them wrote: "
  <em>
   It was just surviving. The road to Avdiivka was full of Ukrainian bodies. "
  </em>
  A commander reported on the radio that the injured would not be evacuated. The men were left behind to be executed by the Russian invaders. In this way, the Ukrainian armed forces made the decision to leave the people, taking Russia their most significant victory since the city of Bakhmut captured last year.
  <em>
   “
  </em>
  <em>
   Be capable
  </em>
  <em>
   To save the town is our most important task, "
  </em>
  Zelensky said in the most cynically possible way at the Munich Security Conference. The New York Times analyzed:
  <em>
   “At the capture of Russia by Avdii

  <em>

  <em>

  We can see that the current trend is that Russian imperialism is on its way to slowly meet its minimum war objectives. The maps published by the BBC clearly show it:

  Also internally, Russian imperialism is making progress. The new leader of the Wagner mercenaries, Anton Yelizarov, subsequently declared on the restructuring of the organization: “We are building a field for the new units to be formed - which will be within the voluntary bodies of the Russian National Guard (Rosgvardiya) - They can get and settle. " This so -called "Cosaco Camp" will be "almost certain" established in the Russian city of Rostov, in the south,
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/feb/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-explosions-in-kyiv-and-other-cities-amid-mass-russian-missile-strikes">
   as the Guardian reports
  </a>
  . This development finally buries all the speculations and dreams of the West of a military coup against Putin. Also, Navalny's death serves in this regard, as judicial orders do so that Boris Nadezhdin cannot participate in the next elections, established for March 15 to 17 or the liquidation of the deserter pilot in Spain.

 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4bab7cf93755715308d9b07b1cd236ca">
  Russian imperialism is not only gaining military. Economically,
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/europe/russia-oil-india-shadow-fleet-cmd-intl/index.html">
   as the CNN reports
  </a>
  , Russia enters its third year of war in Ukraine with an unprecedented amount of money in government chests, swollen with a record of 37 billion dollars from crude oil sales to India in 2024. Therefore, India has Increase your purchases of crude oil 13 times more compared to your purchases before the war, a treatment not subject to sanctions and is completely legal. Russian federal reserves increased to the record of 320 billion dollars and are expected to continue rising. Just a third of money is destined to war in Ukraine.
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0256b9710ed49df5fda13c71800b6832">
  Also in international policies, Russian imperialism is still a force to take into account, as shown in the last proposal for a meeting of all Palestinian factions in Moscow to be able to create national unity in some way, especially between the two great factions , Fatah and Hamas,
  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-02-18-24/h_d7fe8b0d1648652842b5f5daa65928c1">

  On February 18.
 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3532fb59ff1997575ac276eb4601a32d">
  Under these impressions, it is necessary to reaffirm the coming tasks, established by the LCI in February last year:
  <em>
   “We must also do everything to promote the friendship of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. Two villages that were united as one in the great Soviet union under the red flag with the sickle and hammer of Lenin and Stalin are now being directed against each other on the battlefield due to intrigues of the imperialists. Communists in training, revolutionaries and all consequent anti-imperialists have the particular responsibility for increasing

 </p>
 <p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c678e116782625d2492dd7ae1bafb86a">
  <em>
   The propaganda against the imperialist war in Russia, to raise their struggles to new heights against the imperialist State and its war of aggression by all means that they have. Also fight against imperialist warrism and arms shipments in the respective imperialist countries.
