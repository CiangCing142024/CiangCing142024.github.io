 Do not have to write these words to her husband. I want to tell you about my 
 so deep and powerful feelings about you, one last

 Today you are going to die for your country, as a man of glory. You can not 
 not know how proud you are of you, my little poet of me, my

 The most courageous person I know, none would be able 
  to sacrifice themselves for their country as you do. The jealous will say that 
 You are not really French, and yet for them, for freedom, you 
  you sacrificed. I am sure that you are the most French of everyone and 
  Name of our France, our land of asylum, I thank you. You are 37 years old, 
  You could have had all your life in front of you, but today you are going 
 Dying and our projects with you will disappear. You will leave the 
 barbarism of this world, and I hope that your death will be able to bring peace. I 
  am slaughtered, today I do not only lose my husband, I lose 
 half of me. They will kill me for the first time before life 
 does just as much a second. Anger takes place in 
 my little body, they tear our freedom and our heroes from the

 will respect my promise so important for you. My Missak, my darling, 
 You are the most incredible person, courageous, devoted, 
 attentive, beautiful, strong, calm, tireless, loyal, sensitive, delicate, 
 human and true. All women claim that their husbands are the 
 better and with the greatest sincerity I will tell them not, but 
 You, Missak Manouchian, you are. I trust you, I know you 
 You were beaten for our freedoms, to no longer have to undergo the violence of 
  Men and to offer me a better world you give up your life. Never 
 I could not have hoped for a man like you, I am so lucky to 
 Having known you, for having lived in your company, even if it was too short. 
  I still need you, don't leave me on my own, my husband. You 
 made me want to live and without you survive it is difficult for me to 
 Imagine but for you I will do it. You ask me to rebuild my life 
 With another, build a family. But how could I, you 
 Is my life, my man, my past, you were my future, my future. I do not 
 don't want you to be disappointed, but I want to be honest with you when 
  Where I write these words to you, I cannot imagine another life without you. 
 Time may dry up my tears, but I doubt it. This freedom 
 that you grant me to love another, grant the me to love only 
 You. Your melinée, with you forever, my Missak to me.
