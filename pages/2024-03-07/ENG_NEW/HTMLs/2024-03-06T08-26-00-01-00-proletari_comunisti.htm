             TORINO
            </b>
            - the mayor of Turin,
            <b>
             Stefano Lo Russo
            </b>
            , intends to put in
            <b>
             Milan barrier
            </b>
            and
            <b>
             Presidium of law enforcement agencies also during the night
            </b>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            As reported by
            <a href="https://www.torinoggi.it/2024/03/05/leggi-notizia/argomenti/politica-11/articolo/barriera-di-milano-lo-russo-dopo-i-militari-di-giorno-chiedero-presidio-notturno-per-la-sicurez.html" target="_blank">
             Torinoggi
            </a>
            , yesterday the mayor went to
            <b>
             MARKET OF PIAZZA FORONI
            </b>
            for a
            <b>
             site inspection
            </b>
            . In the
            <b>
            </b>
            area, for more than a month now,
            <a href="https://www.quotidianopiemontese.it/2024/01/18/torino-nel-quartiere-di-barriera-di-milano-arriva-lesercito/" target="_blank">
             The army soldiers are present, from 7 to 19
            </a>
            , 
  To guarantee the safety of citizens, as wanted by the government 
 Meloni. However, apparently security does not cover the 
 needs of citizens, who complain
            <b>
             problems
            </b>
            above all
            <b>
             at night
            </b>
            , when the military are no longer present on the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new goal, following yesterday's inspection, is therefore to put in place the possibility of
            <b>
             organize a night garrison
            </b>
            . As announced during the intervention in To-Radio, the first citizen will soon bring this request to
            <b>
             Security table in the Prefecture
            </b>
            .
