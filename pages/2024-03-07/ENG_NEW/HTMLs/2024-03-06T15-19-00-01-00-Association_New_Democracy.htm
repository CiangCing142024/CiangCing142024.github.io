 All to try to dispute Marxism his growing influence and roots in 
 The masses of the world, in the Second Vatican Council (initiated in 1962) it is defined 
 as "the church of the times", trying to renew its image linked to the 
 Half, to the darkness to the Inquisition, and gets more in tune with its mission 
 In the Middle Ages, when the decomposition of the feudal system is given, assuming 
 "Socorro" tasks to the poor, because the expired feudal system can no longer 
 feed your own servants. In the 60s. It accentuates its role as "Socorro" or 
 assistance to the miserable of the earth, when imperialism advances more in 
 its decomposition (president Mao), and the expired system, through alms 
 distributed by the Church and the "aid" of international institutions 
 (Caritas) and the states, their economy, is unable to feed their 
 own slaves. Of those years also dates that of the “preferential option of 
 the church for the poor "and managing within its so -called" theology of the

    Well, dear readers, 
 Song tests, "Papelos speak", there is the hand of Cuban revisionism 
 at the service of the contrasubversive war of the Peruvian State and imperialism 
 Yankee against the PCP and the Popular War, along with a whole range of 
 intellectuals of different currents, so you have to differentiate them, but 
 united for its counterrevolutionary war service. There are the links of 
 DES, with IDL, the Legal Defense Institute children of “Transparecia 
 International ”of Yankee Imperialism and the IEP funded by Aidusa, the 
 CEDEP. The Salcedo Chema of the "unity" revision, of the Prado Carcaman, 
 Promoscovita, Senderologos such as Gonzales, etc.

    We have left them 
 They express themselves, they confirm that with Morales they were 
 dismissed from the state agencies created by Velasco and, then, many 
 They returned and others went to work in non -governmental organizations 
 (NGO). From velasquism to NGOs, that is its origin and process, behind is the 
 Imperialism and the Peruvian and World Reaction (the Vatican) this proves it, 
 It also serves to differentiate them because not all who work there are 
 Imperialists; In addition, it is useful to see how they act in the field.

 that those intellectuals who fulfilled functions within the Sinamos applied what 
 that that organism planned, hence its links with the masses; but how 
 They were thrown by Morales and lacked money went to the agencies 
 international and they fortified them. Thus, they sold their capital 
 intellectual first to fascism and then offered it to imperialism, the same

 Part of this, in addition the Peruvian has never been able to face his 
 Papacy positions, or when his boss came, in addition, he recently just 
 amend your views. Which is a contradiction of agreement, which can 
 be used to divide the enemy, okay, but it must be very clear 
 that we are for the revolution and they for reforms within the same 
 old order, focus on parliamentary cretinism and openly are against 
 the party, the popular war and the new power; They make mass concessions and
