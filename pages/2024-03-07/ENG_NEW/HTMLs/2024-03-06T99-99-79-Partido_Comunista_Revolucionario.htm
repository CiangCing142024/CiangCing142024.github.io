   This date has a great meaning for all, in the first place, because it is a day of struggle and because this March 8 is not another day.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today more than ever we continue to raise the flags of the Socialist Congress of Women of 1910, in Denmark, where Clara Zetkin proposed the commemoration of an International Working Women's Day.
  </p>
  <p>
   This March 8 will find us together in the streets, in the squares, denouncing the alarming and distressing situation we are going through, which we face from each place.
  </p>
  <p>
   It will be a day of struggle, massive, combative and federal.
  </p>
  <p>
   Throughout the country we have been organizing for a month, for this March 8, in assemblies, with our participation in multisectoral, in our neighborhoods, in our workplaces. And we have been organizing it from least to greatest, promoting, at this specific moment, the widest unit, because the situation merits it.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is not time to divide with other forces, even if we have differences, it is time to face, as we have been doing from each place and from the first moment in which this policy was applied that carry out Milei, Villarruel and Bullrich of Hunger, of delivery of delivery of Our sovereignty and our wealth, and repression. We have been doing an important tour, fighting the unity of the entire women's and feminist movement of our country. There was a significant amount of meetings throughout the country to capture the unit and one of the main points of agreement is how to face hunger, poverty, adjustment and inflation that are discharged with fury over our people.
  </p>
  <p>
   We are part of our people, who has been fighting against the brutal adjustment of the redational and fascist government of Milei, with massive strikes, such as the 24/1 where we made the Busian law backward, with struggles that travel our country: workers, peasants, of Women and youth, from natives, of culture and science workers and other popular sectors.
  </p>
  <p>
   This March 8 we have a lot to say, to claim, to continue fighting:
  </p>
  <p>
   Women and dissidents have lower employment and more precarious rate; with income and salaries that are three times less than those of men. Salaries, pensions and retirements border the indigence line. Thousands were thrown into poverty in these last two months.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first violence we receive women and dissidents is poverty. The prices of the family basket reached a 200%increase, and we cannot meet the basic needs. Many families today eat once a day. Millions of women are heads of family, they are alone and see how the economy collapses; Nothing reaches. Danger that the boys can start classes: school supplies suffered a rise of more than 200%.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is no food delivery in the dining rooms, so they cannot even go looking for a plate of food. Many children stopped consuming milk, meat and bread. The 10 kg carafe in many neighborhoods costs $ 15,000.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, the housing situation for millions was aggravated, affected by the repeal of the rental law. Contracts can be negotiated in any period and currency, under any price and update, completely forsaken the tenants.
  </p>
  <p>
   The health situation is alarming: increases in prepaid medicine, although 90% do not have it. 80% of the financing of the public system is in charge of the provinces and municipalities (65% and 15% respectively) therefore the effect of the restriction of co -participible resources is devastating. In addition, the Ministry of Health of the Nation stated that the budget is frozen. This affects vaccination, reproductive health, AIDS, tuberculosis, oncological and others. Pharmaceuticals such as Roemmers and Bagó fill their pockets with released prices.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another of the issues that will be on this day is the growth of violence against women. In January of this 2024 there were 30 femicides.
  </p>
  <p>
   There will also be the claim on what this government intends, such as the repeal of Law IVE, approved in 2020 as well as the prohibition of inclusive language in public administration and other places.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course there are thousands of more claims, which will be visible on this day. In this situation our program is fully valid:
  </p>
  <p>
   *Equal salary for equal work. I work for all. Enough of inflation and adjustment.
  </p>
  <p>
   *No to the IMF.
  </p>
  <p>
   *Salaries, retirements and pensions that allow the family basket to be achieved.
  </p>
  <p>
   *Emergency in violence against women, salaries for promoters in violence prevention. Enough of femicides.
  </p>
  <p>
   *Maternal-patchring gardens in each workplace and study.
  </p>
  <p>
   *School Kits for school age.
  </p>
  <p>
   Food supply to dining rooms and snacks throughout the country.
  </p>
  <p>
   *Earth, roof and work for all.
  </p>
  <p>
   *Down the DNU 70 and the repressive protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
