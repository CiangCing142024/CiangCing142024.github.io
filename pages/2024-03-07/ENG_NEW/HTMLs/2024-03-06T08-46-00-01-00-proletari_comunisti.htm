     Deaths at work: from daily tranquility to periodic massacres. The "what to do" is already in the laws (1)
    </span>
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Three days before the massacre in the Esselunga construction site in Florence 
 The European Court of Human Rights condemned Switzerland to not 
  having "complied with its obligation to guarantee the speed of the 
 procedure before the Federal Court »on the serious injuries suffered by 
 A worker prescribed by the slowness of the process. In Italy the 
 our Cassation recognized the right to oblivion in 2019 
 in the most serious crimes, and the National Public Prosecutor on Work Safety 
 remains confined to the dream book when it could make more incisive 
  the exercise of the criminal action. On the contracts in contract and subcontracting the 
 security obligations are already provided and criminally sanctioned to be dependent 
  both of the clients, and of the contractors or subcontractors and 
 self-employed. Adequate organic and preparation are missing 
 professional controls to exercise systematic supervision e 
 incisive on the application of the rules. And effective means to 
 Workers' representatives for safety.
  </p>
  <p>
   Therefore, verbal appeals (or singing) are not enough. It is now clear 
 also in the light of the most recent jurisprudential case which, among the 
  multiple problems that have been placing the world of security lately 
  At work, the one concerning protection is being revealed 
 of the workers of the contractors and subcontractors detached 
 at small and large client companies. All the more so they appear, 
  Therefore, the interpretative and application misunderstandings 
 exploded on the subject. Do not think, first of all, that the laws are missing. The 
 Consolidated Work Safety Text is very much
   <span>
   </span>
  </p>
  <a name="more">
  </a>
  rigorous with regard 
  to the works entrusted by the client to contracting companies or 
 subcontractors or self -employed workers, you want within your own 
 Company, you want on temporary or mobile construction sites. And mind you that the 
 safety obligations are provided and criminally sanctioned to be dependent 
  of the clients, both of the contractors or subcontractors and 
 self-employed.
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   And so why? Because the obligations are there, but they are not made 
 systematically respect. Of course, there are the supervisory bodies. But 
 weigh the deficiencies suffered by the staff and the professionalism of 
 These organs. Nor is it objected that the controls would not have a capacity 
 direct preventive, in the sense that a vigilance that 
 He arrives the day before the injury and avert him. Evident is that 
 It is already necessary to already an unimaginable supervision of the day before, but the 
  systematic and incisive vigilance capable of pushing businesses 
 the actual observance of the rules written on paper. A goal, 
  This, which, however, appears unattainable in the absence of an effective 
  intervention of the judicial authority. Too often the procedures 
 penalties are not conducted with the indispensable in -depth analysis or in 
 time necessary to avoid the prescription of the crimes. With the 
 disruptive result that spreads between companies, and among them 
 workers, the idea that the laws are there, but they can be violated 
 impunity.
  </p>
  <p>
   Nor can the many prosecutors of the republic established remedy 
 in our country, each with a restricted area of operation, and for 
 rarely came with specialization on the subject. Nor does it take on 
 relief is the objection moved by some according to which the action of the public 
 Ministry would be merely repressive, and never preventive. An objection 
 clearly contrasting with the multiple judicial experiences that in 
  past have developed under the sign of a close combination between 
 concession and repression jointly aimed at guaranteeing compliance 
 of the criminally sanctioned safety standards regardless of the 
  existence of a crime of murder or personal injury 
 consisting of an injury or in a occupational disease.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately, he continues to remain written in the dream book there 
 proposal to create a National Public Prosecutor on Labor Safety. A 
  proposal that none of the governments that have followed one another in these years 
 He was able to make. And I add that very precious has proved to be 
 The experience he has led to some courts to entrust the 
 Procedures regarding work safety at specialized sections.
  </p>
  <p>
   It's still. Let's not forget to accompany the same representative 
 of workers for security (RLS) in the world of contracts and 
 construction sites, even more so after his first sentence for an injury 
  mortal pronounced by the Cassation on 25 September 2023.
  </p>
  <p>
   Of course, it is an embarrassing dimension, and - I'm afraid - 
 Usually neglected, of the commitment entrusted tor. Yet, among his 
  attribution, the Tusl (Consolidated Labor Safety Text), 
 to art. 50, paragraph 1, letter a), indicates that of visiting the places of 
 work, and for workplaces are not only the company premises, 
 But - the Cassation teaches peacefully - «every place where the 
 worker must or can go to provide for inconcriptions of any 
 nature in relation to one's business ", and, therefore, even every place 
 in which a contract or subcontracting or a construction site takes place. So more 
 which I never ask the trade union organizations (but also to the legislator): 
 on what resources of time, of means, of autonomy, can concretely 
 I count the RLS called to carry out such demanding tasks?
  </p>
  <p>
   That's all to say, at this point, that we had to greet with words 
 of hope the ruling issued on February 13, 2024 by the European Court 
 of human rights in leaning Jann-Zwicker et
   <em>
    Jann Contro Switzerland
   </em>
   on 
  A case that occurred in Switzerland of death for fallen pleural mesothelioma 
 in prescription. Nor the criminal proceeding started in 2006 by 
 same interested party for serious personal injury (but not cultivated by 
 Swiss courts), nor the civil procedure started by the next 
 joined in 2009 after the death, they allowed the moments of 
 get a favorable result. Unanimous conclusion of the Court 
 European human rights: «The prescription of the action promoted 
 From the victim he involved a violation of the European Convention of 
  Human rights ": of art. 6 § 1 (right to a fair process) e 
 of art. 6 § 1 (as regards the duration of the procedure in front of 
 national jurisdictions). Therefore, a violation due to the fact that «it 
  State has not complied with its obligation to guarantee the speed of the 
 procedure before the Federal Court ". With the consequence that the 
 Switzerland must pay 20,800 euros to the moments for moral damage and 14,000 
  for costs and expenses. Other than that "right to oblivion" enhanced by 
 Cassation in a sentence dated 28 March 2019 n. 13582: «After a 
 certainly a period of time from the commission of the fact, given the attenuation 
 of punishment needs, mature a right to oblivion 
 to the author of the crime "(1)
