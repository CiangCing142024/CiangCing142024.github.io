   The National Government, chaired by Javier Milei and Victoria Villarruel, in just over two months has greatly deepened the sufferings of the Argentine people.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the specific case of public education, it has decided to stop turning the budgetary items for education to each province: the National Teaching Incentive Fund (FONID), Connectivity, Salary Compensating Fund and other educational items (pedagogical programs, school dining rooms and Cup of Cup and Cup of milk, progress, connect equality and school infrastructure). It also eliminates the Institutional Improvements Plan of Technical Schools and the budgetary lines that are fundamental for its operation. And refuses to convene the National Teaching Parity.
  </p>
  <p>
   These are the causes that explain the national unemployment of Ctera, of February 26, date on which the school cycle 10 educational jurisdictions began.
  </p>
  <p>
   The forcefulness of the call to the National Teaching strike by all the centrals led the National Government to summon the guilds to a meeting, without it having the character of the national parity claimed. Ctera decides to hold it despite this call.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even so, to that meeting the National Government was without any response to the teaching demands of education funds.
  </p>
  <p>
   Given this situation, the national teaching unions nucleated in the CGT, call a national strike on March 4.
  </p>
  <p>
   We consider that being the same claims that gave rise to the national unemployment of Ctera on Monday 26, we call on all the other national and provincial unions to converge in the 4th unemployment and in all the measures that arise from now on (8 and 24 March and April 2, on the way to a great federal march together with the university unions) and to make the highest efforts to strengthen unity to face the policies of adjustment and delivery of this reactionary and fascist government.
