  The pages of the press are full of the question of the dossier 
 of the Perugia investigation. There is an investigation, apparently, of the 
 Prosecutor of Perugia who uses investigations by the Guardia di Finanza in 
 Picture is still not clear that.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But 
 "Secret dossier", use of the judiciary to hit the parties 
 adverse within the economic, political and social system of 
 This country are inherent in the capitalist system which, behind the 
 dress of freedom and democracy, covers a war between gangs, a war 
 between bandits to occupy the main economic positions, to do 
 profits, to control economy, state, judiciary.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 So nothing new under the sun. The nature of these operations 
 P2 taught us. Operations that were intended to provide 
 the tools for an institutional reform, for a real change of 
 regime in our country, to cancel the Republic born from 
 Resistance and establish a modern fascist dictatorship.

 National Renaissance Gelli Plan: the heirs of this Gelli plan 
 I am in government and not from now, but from the long cycle that has brought 
 From Berlusconi to Meloni.

 I am 
 Specialists in the use of the secret dossiers of so -called services 
 "Secrets", of the so -called "deviated" apparatus of the state, 
 piloted magistrates. They are specialists.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now 
 they scream to the plot.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  I had 
 The Minister of Defense Crosetto began, to say: "There are some 
 Investigations, they want to hit us with the judiciary ".
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Wanted 
 The sky was true! Because, actually, behind the white leaf of the "Virgin from the candid mantle" 
 of Meloni, a worm of corrupt ministers is hidden, linked to 
 business, linked to the parasitism, social and political of this country. 
 Crosetto, who is on the payroll of the war industry and all of his 
 action is based on the interests of the war industry, as a 
 saleswoman of the war industry should actually be 
 investigated and hit for
  <span>

 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 This figure of his.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 What about Santanch√©? What about the filthy slaves of the 
 Government, of the Mastro, the Undersecretary who shoots the policeman ... .. 
 a shit. This shit should be brought to light, it should 
 Going out into the newspapers should be hit by the judiciary. Self 
 This was the purpose of this investigation we are in favor of 
 This investigation. But let's fear that it is not so, that it is still inside 
 the war between bands that use official and unofficial means in the 
 Economic policy dispute and so on.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  However 
 We think that all those who are subjects of this investigation, 
 belonging, both to the government area and to the oppositions, are 
 of criminals. And that for this reason their shores are in defense 
 of the crime because, apart from dossier and counter -pounds, the only one 
 attention that the press should have and, consequently, i 
 citizens and the judiciary, is what the things written about it 
 To these characters are true or not! And are quiet: they are true 
 In most cases.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 shows the rotten of a social political system, of the way of 
 Training of governments, ministers of his ruling class. I am 
 The rotten, natural product of the capitalist-imperialist system 
 in its putrescent phase of which Italy is part.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 System must be shot down, this is the point. This system does not 
 reforms, breaks down and does not change, if you don't want the 
 Verminaio of what is written by the newspapers remains unpunished e 
 only a factor of the political struggle between parties and gangs remains between 
 gangs, between businessmen, between masters and masters, etc. etc. 
 work for a different future that breaks down this system.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Abatement 
 of this system cannot take place within whom this system 
 He keeps him standing, he cannot take place inside his 
 institutions, not because there are also no good ones in the institutions 
 people but because the institutions and the logic that forms them, guides them, 
 Plasma is something that serves to preserve this system. TO 
 Also keep when you criticize it to try to save him.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For 
 This is necessary a revolution! A social revolution, 
 politics, moral, cultural that can lead to restore in 
 our country a semblance of civilization, democracy, of 
 equality, of freedom. All this, in the current historical phase, yes 
 he calls political struggle against a modern fascism, police status, 
 regime of governments as business committees, states at the service of 
 strong powers, namely the great industrial, banking capital, etc. 
 etc.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There 
 Fight against this system must be conducted by those who have no 
 interest and does not derive any privilege from this system: and these 
 are the workers and workers who, just to say, are the only ones 
 that "pay the taxes fully", as they say normally, 
 while from the little one to the great trader, from the masters to the banks, they 
 taxes do not pay or pay them a ridiculous measure.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 So we are always there. Are the exploited, the oppressed, the masses 
 of this country, and among them a lot of good people who are not part 
 exactly of the proletariat of the popular masses, who must 
 rebel.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But 
 The rebellion does not go through the votes. Does not pass through the system, 
 We saw it. When it puts confidence in parties that are said 
 Against the caste, against the system etc. etc. - see the last experience 
 of the 5 Star Movement, of the grillini - you can see the end they do, 
 It is then seen how this populist demagogy leads them to Parliament, 
 in which they then turn into more or less systematic rulers 
 of this system, and indeed, when they are not needed, they leave the pace a 
 Worst people of them as those in government are currently.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So 
 not the parliamentary way and not the vote change things and the way 
 parliamentary or vote are an influential participation factor 
 in public life, in the construction of governments, in operation 
 of the state, in what is absolutely indispensable e 
 necessary in every society.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 Here that the need for the revolution is born.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There 
 Revolution is not a password of ancient extremists set 
 For communism, already failed in Russia and China. All this is 
 A caricatured version. The revolution is a people who do 
 rebel, guided by the class that produces wealth in this 
 country and therefore can transform this wealth from a source of 
 profit in a source of well -being. This class is the working class, together with all those who in this country perceive income, salaries, 
 necessary to live in different degrees, these are masses. But the masses 
 who vote, the masses that vents their opposition 
 in electoral abstention or in the mass media, in social networks, such as yes 
 he says, they are helpless masses, companions who accompany the 
 ordinary operation of this system that does not deserve to 
 work.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 So there is a need for a necessary change, of an initial gearbox, build the 
 tools to fight against this system for a real revolution 
 And for a change in progress, because fighting you change.
