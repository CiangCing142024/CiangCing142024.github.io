  The Madrid popular movement managed to avoid the eviction of the CPK (Kolelectivized political center) La Bankarrota, which was scheduled on Wednesday, March 20. The eviction was scheduled at 08: 00h and the presence of the UIP (Police Intervention Unit), the riot. The Buitre “Arguijo” Fund wanted to expel the masses that were organized to conquer it, which in its day snatched the financial entity Caja Madrid. But the police, a faithful prey dog of the financial capital (embodied this time in the vulture background "argue"), I cannot dislodge the center.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2ad6116eaf4ec54313d7997f5f53a403">
  The presence of the masses was greater and better organized than the State's repression forces could think. Seeing that there was not enough police presence to execute the eviction, those responsible for eviction sent to the Judicial Commission to delay it and mark a new date (even without schedule, that we know, today). In this way the eviction was avoided: with the organization and mobilization of the masses, which before 08:00, presented themselves in the surroundings willing to put their body before the riot units. Although this victory is temporary and the financial capital will try again to snatch the building, we are sure that the popular movement will defend, once again, these physical spaces of political organization of the working class.

  The CPK La Bankarrota has been a physical center of political organization of the masses, especially those of the Moratalaz neighborhood, which is where it is located (Palacios Encomienda street, number 46). In the call to defend the social center, CPK itself wrote: “
  <em>
   During the last 9 years, the Bankarrota has served as a meeting space for multiple groups of Moratalaz and Madrid. From here evictions have stopped, they have been able to raise funds for repressive expenses, very interesting talks and debates have been made, it has served as a political refuge for many organizations
  </em>
  ”.

  The defense of the CPK La Bankarrota is a breath of fresh air in a month of intense heat. On March 13, the Railway (also in Madrid) and the CSO L’Obrera (Sabadell) was evicted. A day later, on 14, CSO Loira (Zaragoza). In fact, this concatenation of repressive acts is such that a good part of the popular movement considers that this March has begun one "
  <em>
   War against social centers ”.
  </em>
  This war will be long, with evictions that are gone and others that are lost, but the fight must continue until there are
  <em>
   Ten, one hundred, thousand social centers!
  </em>
  [slogan that was heard in the mobilization that avoided the eviction].

  The author of this article considers that this
  <em>
   guerra
  </em>
  It is part of the crisis and decomposition process of imperialism, and militarization of states. In this specific case, the offensive against social centers is within the logic of the Spanish state militarization process. Moreover, taking into account the maximum importance of the housing sector in our country, where financial capital is particularly more aggressive than in other sectors of the economy. It is enough to remember that the financial capital skips all bourgeois legality when required. The best example is that their most reactionary shock troops (landslide companies) are openly fascist pseudo-paramilitaries.

  We will be alert until you know which eviction is.
