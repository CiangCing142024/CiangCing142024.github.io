     As it always has been and shall always be so long as the fascist 
occupation force calling itself Israel, its band of degenerate war 
criminals and rapists attempting to pass themselves off as a ‚Äúdefense 
force‚Äù and the equally vile settlers which illiterates and idiots 
believe to be ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù continue to exist in any capacity, the entire 
Arab nation and Palestine in particular face the worst genocide in 
living memory and an existential threat. Since Hamas launched its 
offensive to reclaim Arab land in response to the illegal and severe 
violations against their people Israel routinely commits on October 7th,
 the zionist filth have committed the most disgusting war crimes 
possible in plain view.
    </p>
    <p>
     This includes instances of occupation forces making videos on social
 media making light of the fact that Arabs will starve or die of 
dehydration on account of their crimes, posting about sending the filth 
of their bloodlines gifts stolen from the homes of civilians they 
displaced, dedicating the destruction of whole towns to their spouses 
and in the case of a particular French zionist abomination, posing on 
social media with the undergarments of women whose homes him and his 
pack of unhinged, inbred war criminals plundered.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     These are just the instances of the occupation forces going above 
and beyond to break the spirit of the Arab people and reveling in their 
criminality. It does not come close to the additional, far more severe 
war crimes ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù has committed such as the deployment of the 
internationally banned white phosphorus, their informing civilians in 
the Northern Gaza Strip to evacuate the North before promptly bombing 
the South, the Flour Massacre where they ran down hundreds of civilians 
with tanks as they were fleeing and this is only what is most egregious 
and recent. The amount of crimes this settler colony has committed and 
continues to commit in this war alone defies comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That Hamas has repeatedly offered peace terms, the UN, itself 
controlled by the imperialist yankee filth, has passed resolutions 
calling for a ceasefire and the general public, even among the 
profiteers of imperialism in the west have held demonstrations for 
Palestine and still ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù continues its course proves what anyone 
with any sense has known since their awareness of Israel‚Äôs existence. 
These are not men of reason and for Israel, this is not a war. It is a 
wholesale genocide with the only goal being the theft of Arab land, the 
resources in it and the eradication of the native population.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since the last time we spoke about the situation, at the dawn of the
 war between Hamas and the zionist entity, we have seen a situation that
 would be astonishing for those who do not understand the terroristic 
character of the IDF.
    </p>
    <p>
     Documents shared on Wikileaks and Times of Israel have revealed what
 should be common knowledge at this point: the occupiers‚Äô plan is 
essentially to destroy Gaza and deport the population, considered too 
rebellious, to most probably, Egypt. The goal is no longer (if you 
believe it was ever the intention!) to destroy Hamas, but to destroy 
Gaza.
    </p>
    <p>
     We remember when the Israeli government, after explaining to the 
Gazan populations that to escape Israeli bombings and attacks, they 
needed to migrate to the South, and that now that the North is finished,
 the South with Rafah is suffering all the fire from the imperialist 
forces.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gaza is experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis: nearly 
90,000 injured and dead, 1.9 million people currently displaced. Hunger,
 bombings, death, rubble are the daily lives of nearly 2.5 million 
people. As even the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, from a cosmopolitan organization that itself supported 
(even created!) Israel, stated the 30th of January 2024:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Life for civilians in Gaza is a real ordeal. Thousands of people are
 constantly on the move, having to leave places they were told were safe
 and living in constant fear. People make tents out of plastic bags and 
pieces of wood. They live on only one meal a day, if they are lucky. An 
image remains etched in my mind: I saw more than a hundred children 
running towards a cart bringing food. We see children everywhere, 
carrying water in cans, sometimes as young as 4 years old, chopping wood
 to make a fire. Children have not been going to school for months: 
schools and universities have been destroyed, destroying all hope for 
the future. Clinics and hospitals have been attacked, very few of them 
are still functioning, whether to provide trauma care or to help a woman
 give birth.‚Äù
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Israel‚Äôs most recent crimes, as of the time this is being 
written, is the Flour Massacre, during which several hundred 
Palestinians simply waiting for food were crushed and fired upon by 
Israeli tanks. Israel is in its very essence, exterminationist and seeks
 to end the existence of the Arab Nation. We must mention that the 
situation in the West Bank has gotten even worse since the beginning of 
the war. Israel is limiting far more to the Palestinians displaced in 
the West Bank, blocking access to main roads from villages, revoking all
 permits to enter Israel for work and creating dozens of checkpoints. In
 short, even the Arabs who wanted to be assimilated inside of the jewish
 welfare state are oppressed!
    </p>
    <p>
     The two foreign ministers of France and Germany requested an 
international investigation to determine responsibility for the 
massacre‚Ä¶While the Israelis themselves admitted their responsibility, 
and simply explained that these shots were in reaction to Arabs 
approaching a military post (we must note that the investigation 
provided by the zionist New York Times indicates that the massacre was 
planned).
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     We saw M√©lenchon, the representative of the new French social democracy, say in a rally in support of Gaza :
    </p>
    <p>
     ‚ÄúLong live you Paris, of all colors and religions, you are the 
epitome of humanity. And eternal glory to Gaza and those who resist‚Äù The
 reader must notice the ‚Äúhonor‚Äù of being addressed to Paris, this 
cosmopolitan city, linked to a romantic love for Hamas. M√©lenchon 
essentially shared with us this dangerous, almost Machiavellian poison 
of humanism, this idea that the Hamas movement only represents the 
quintessence of the human ideal of emancipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is why this extreme left always highlights the horrific nature 
of Israeli crimes, with dead children, famine, old men forced to 
migrate, etc. This was seen on social networks, on which we saw leftists
 sharing gory images in order to shock the white middle class‚Ä¶. As if, 
if Israel was sympathetic in its war, these people would support Israel!
 We must be clear. Israel is an enemy, whether left or right, it must be
 exterminated.
    </p>
    <p>
     The humanitarian situation was so terrible that an American soldier,
 Aaron Bushnell, self- immolated. We must understand that a man setting 
himself on fire is proof of a society in revolt. We remember when 
Vietnamese Buddhist students set themselves on fire in protest of the 
South Vietnamese comprador dictatorship, fully supported by America. We 
must salute the courage of this man, and may he rest in power.
    </p>

       In essence, they will affirm ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs right to exist‚Äù while 
condemning the brazen and undeniable genocide, brutality and general 
violence of ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù, but also while refusing to acknowledge that no 
‚ÄúIsraeli‚Äù has any right to any part of Palestine and being perfectly 
content with the assimilation and more soft erasure of Arabs. An Arab to
 a neo-zionist is like an indigenous American to the US while to a 
post-zionist, they are more akin to an Afro-American. The erasure and 
destruction of the Arabs in Palestine and possibly across the whole of 
Arabia is a perfectly acceptable outcome for these chauvinistic 
scoundrels provided the Arab nation is too weak to resist and Israel 
destroys the people in less violent ways. They are not for this just 
cause and anyone who believes otherwise is a damn fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must note the statement by the PFLP in response to the Western cries over Israeli crimes :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We call on all living forces, including solidarity and trade unions,
 to escalate all forms of struggle and pressure aimed at stopping 
supplies destined to equip the zionist killing machine against our 
people, whether by opposing decisions to export arms and materials 
supporting the criminal occupation, or by direct objections aimed at 
obstructing the transportation and shipment of ammunition for 
extermination.
        <br/>
        We stress the need for everyone to fulfill their duty 
to support the steadfastness of our people in Gaza Strip, both 
materially and morally, and the need to work to expand, develop and 
organize the forms and tools of support.
        <br/>
        We call for organizing, 
institutionalizing and structuring these movements to ensure continuity 
and impact in order to save humanity from its moral predicament.
        <br/>
        We 
salute the global people movements and their living conscience that 
rejects the hysteria of the Zionist/imperialist war leadership. We 
especially salute the new pulse led by consciousness activists in the 
world, as a true, free, democratic and peaceful expression of victory 
for the universality of Palestine.‚Äù
        <br/>
        PFLP-26 February 2024
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In short, the organization accepts some support from Western people,
 neglecting to mention the labor aristocracy. Why? We must explain 
something simple : the labor aristocracy theory is part of a western 
critique of the inefficiency of the western revolutionary movement. The 
third world never needed this theory for its forces. The PFLP kept the 
Brezhnevite strategy of supporting all communist parties, even the 
western degenerate ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The resistance groups movements which launched the initial war of 
liberation held a meeting in Moscow to talk between each other, invited 
by Putin‚Äôs envoy in the Middle East:
      </p>
      <p>
       ‚ÄúIn his speech, Fahd Suleiman (General Secretary of Democratic Front
 for Liberation of Palestine) emphasized the seriousness and deep sense 
of national responsibility that prevailed in the Palestinian meeting. He
 also praised the role played by Professor Naumkin in managing the 
meeting sessions, and the positive assistance he provided that provided 
the opportunity to agree on the positive statement issued by the two 
meetings, which necessarily bears the fingerprints of the Russian 
capital.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
‚Äúdelegation stressed the need to seize the opportunity for dialogue in 
Algeria despite the existing obstacles and difficulties, stressing that 
the Front delegation for dialogue will make sincere efforts to reach an 
agreement that puts an end to the division and actually begins the 
measures to build national unity. The Front delegation praised the role 
of the Russian Federation in supporting the struggle of the Palestinian 
people, as well as the importance of continuing this role and doing 
everything possible within international institutions to put an end to 
attacks and ‚ÄúIsraeli‚Äù violations against our country, people and our 
land.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       In short all Palestinians are behind Russia against the West, in the
 goal of using them against America. This proved that the goal of the 
Arab resistance movements was never to destroy Jewry (contrary to the 
several claims of the Zionist medias that pretended the goal of Hamas 
was ‚Äúto destroy Israel‚Äù) but to one last effort to bring the war on 
international grounds, to have the support of Russia, China and Iran 
against America.
      </p>
      <p>
       PFLP and DFLP both support the idea of an ‚ÄúIslamic and Arab‚Äù Nation.
 This is a good development, since all Palestinian factions support in 
words the idea of an unitary Arab country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that, apparently, Iran and Hezbollah were not warned 
of the battle, and so weren‚Äôt able to prepare themselves for the war 
against the zionist entity. Had they the political ambition to launch a 
total war against this Entity? We can‚Äôt be sure : Hezbollah didn‚Äôt start
 any Islamic Revolution, in a context where it is the most popular 
political force in Lebanon. To be a little provocative, the problem of 
Hezbollah is not that it is an ‚ÄúIslamist terrorist‚Äù group like MSM 
pretends to be, but that it is not nearly radical enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, it is probable that Israel prepares itself to invade 
Lebanon, as it bombs Lebanon daily and even uses chemical weapons 
against the South of Lebanon (I may remind people that this was the main
 criticism the degenerate leftoids had against Assad, that he apparently
 ‚Äúused chemical weapons‚Äù!). Israel knows, thanks to the 2006 war, that 
it can‚Äôt invade Lebanon, and so has one goal : ending the war in 
Ukraine, so the West will concentrate all its forces and put all its 
financial power into consolidating the interests of the zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only solution to this genocide and all ongoing violations is 
unification of all Arabs against the zionist entity and foreign powers, 
and political revolution against all of the reactionary monarchies 
colluding with the Imperialists. Highlighting the criminal character of 
Israel may provide some reprieve should we receive a sufficient amount 
of miracles on the day in question, but there is no positive outcome 
that does not entail the eradication of the monstrosity known as Israel.
