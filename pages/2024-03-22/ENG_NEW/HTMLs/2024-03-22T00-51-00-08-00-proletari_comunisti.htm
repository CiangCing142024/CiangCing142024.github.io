  The Mediterranean, Africa and the Middle East are the other front 
 of war lit by the interimperialist dispute, with troops 
 military of imperialist governments on the ground to strengthen the axis 
 of terror, together with their Zionist ally, against the Arab peoples 
 with Palestine in the center.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This 
 war front is strategic for the Italian imperialist state, ce 
 The governments and the so -called are repeating it until nausea 
 "Analysts" close to the Italian military-industrial apparatus, e 
 The Meloni/Crosetto/Tajani government is precisely on interventionism 
 Italian imperialist who focuses a lot, Meloni swelled it 
 so much so as to push the press enslaved to baptize it “Piano 
 Mattei ”, to give him an apparently strategic guise for 
 Instead, hiding the reality made of refusals contracted to 
 reactionary governments, of profits derived from the robbery of resources 
 energy and from the goods that pass through the area, of imposition 
 of the iron heel of the imperialist armies to crush the 
 aspirations of peoples and dominating the world trade that passes 
 in the Red Sea.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  There

 further for all governments and parties

 of Europe to grow 
 as consent and legitimize their repression policies e 
 oppression, both within the respective imperialist states, and 
 outside against the peoples.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  In 
 This context on Sunday 17 March was held in the visit to Cairo del 
 President of the Council of Italian Ministers, Meloni, together with 
 President of the European Commission, von der Leyen, always 
 available when he has to support the racist policies of 
 Antimmigrati rejections in the company of the Government Capa of 
 Italian (nobody can and must forget the massacre of migrants a 
 Cutro, where on those who died of Italian and European responsibilities 
 The two torture had strengthened their unit). Of the delegation 
 which aimed at the strengthening of the EU-Egypt strategic partnership has 
 The President of the Republic of Cyprus, current 
 President of the EU Council, the first ministers of Greece e 
 Austria.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  I am 
 went to sign the new EU-Egypt pact, a 7.4 billion plan 
 euros, between loans and subsidies.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The 
 Cairo from the EU is considered "reliable partner", a 
 "Mediterranean security pillar", as we read 
 in the joint declaration.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Furthermore 
 The adjective "historical" could not miss this time even 
 in defining political, commercial, military agreements. Each step 
 politician of the Meloni government rests on empty words that cloak the 
 His imperialist, neocolonial politics.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This 
 of the European partnership was one of the legs on which the 
 imperialist strengthening of the Al Sisi regime in Egypt, the other 
 They are bilateral relationships Italy-Egypt that materialize in new ones 
 Memorandum.
 </p>
 <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  With the 
 Agreements with Libya, Tunisia and Albania, the Meloni government pursues the 
 same way also with Egypt his policy to prevent the 
 departures of migrants fleeing hunger and wars with concentration camps where 
 lock them up, a policy strengthened by the Meloni/planted government 
 of criminalization/repression of the NGOs engaged in the rescue in 
 sea.
 </p>
 <p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   “The crisis of Gaza 
 It is at the top of our concerns, "said Meloni but,, 
 Since he did absolutely nothing to stop the genocide 
 of the Israeli Nazisionist state against Gaza and all of Palestine 
 occupied and bombed, the so -called "concerns" of his and the 
 governments are only for preventing the departures of migrants e 
 suffocate the support also armed with the resistance of the people of the 
 Yemen, defined by the "Ribelli Houthi" press, which, in the name of 
 that solidarity with the Palestinian people, affects the interests 
 of imperialism that instead supports the terrorist n ° 1 of the area, 
 the Nazisionist state of Israel and attacks the goods of the 
 Imperialists passing through the Red Sea.
  </p>
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   THE 
 regimes asserted for imperialism thus become a sting 
 indispensable and imperialist governments of them spin rivers of 
 money. In Italy this pompously call it "Piano Mattei" 
 and the model that the Italian government is proud of is that 
 signed with Sieda's Tunisia last September, also, 
 Not surprisingly, baptized by Meloni and von der Leyen.
  </p>
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The fire 
 of the war - or rather - of the genocide in progress in Palestine from 
 part of the Naziosionist occupant of Israel, supported 
 from western imperialism with the US on their heads and with the role 
 Active, accomplice, of the Italy of the Meloni government, has broken down in 
 Middle, for the support of the resistance of Yemen to 
 Palestinian resistance and with the influx of weapons, military, US/EU 
 in the Red Sea with the aim of extinguishing political solidarity 
 and military of the peoples to the Palestinian cause and for open support 
 to the Nazisionist genocide.
  </p>
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Hold up 
 Al-Sisi means first of all to run to help him to support 
 The whole apparatus of domination of the coup, from the military to the banks, 
 who brought the Egyptian people to their knees to which they now do 
 add the migratory waves from Gaza and Sudan, created by 
 same imperialists.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The rejections of the 
 migrants will be one of the themes of the G7 so it is a central question for 
 An anti -imperialist struggle.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The initiative 
 European follows the economic support that Egypt is 
 insured by the United Arab Emirates and the Monetary Fund 
 international (IMF). Between the end of February and the beginning of March 
 Cairo received 10 billion dollars provided by a fund 
 Emiratine. A project that provides for an initial investment of 35 
 billions of dollars and which will allow you to replenish the coffers of the 
 State, on which they burdened the effects of the war in the strip 
 of Gaza. On 6 March, the IMF announced that it wants to increase 
 from 3 to 8 billion dollars the value of the loan that will provide 
 to Egypt in exchange for the economic reforms that, translated, 
 It means downloading with repression, with imposition, the whole 
 austerity policy of the Egyptian reactionary regime against his 
 same people.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   On the situation 
 Egyptian economic weighs a debt that, according to World data 
 Bank of September 2023, amounts to 164.5 billion dollars. The rate 
 of annual inflation rose to 36% in January, without possibility 
 of contraction within a short time - also because the central bank 
 has decided to make the pound exchange rate flexible 
 Egyptian (now exchanged at 50 per dollar, against the 30 average of the 
 2023).
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Help 
 economically the coup at Sisi means, as a counterpart, 
 obtain his involvement in the repression of migrants and, for 
 Italian imperialism, this also means the profits related 
 to the exploitation of energy resources, strategic topic for 
 the imperialist countries, which for this reason are scanning and there are there 
 dragging into the world slaughterhouse.
  </p>
  <p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    So I'm not there 
 Only anti -maid rejections in this agreement between Meloni and al 
 Sisi, there is also energy supply: Eni has 
 Put your hands on the Nargis-1 natural gas well.

    It produces about 60% of the country's total gas production 
 North African and also manages the gas export system 
 natural liquefied from the port of Damietta of 5 million tons 
 the year.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    For Italy 
 imperialist represented by the Meloni government was 
 sign an agreement with the Golder at Sisi precisely coinciding with 
 The hearing of the trial for the death of Giulio Regeni, the young man 
 Italian researcher, killed and tortured horribly by the services 
 Egyptian secrets of which he is headed by Sisi, and this hearing began the 
 March 18 in Rome.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    Nothing can put 
 The relations between Italy and Egypt are under discussion, they do not count 
 massacres or human rights violations, indeed, are strengthened 
 the civil business and, above all, the military one that has grown 
 dizzyingly, with the Fincantieri and the 
 Leonardo.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    On this the 
 Egyptian president at Sisi, in the presence of Eni's AD, Claudio 
 Descalzi, declared that "the assassination was committed for 
 ruin relations with Italy "and" to damage Egypt " 
 and, aimed at Descalzi, “knows why they wanted to damage the 
 Relations between Egypt and Italy? So that we did not arrive here ”. But 
 Not only have they arrived so far, they also went on.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    In the last five 
 years the Italian war industries exported to the strength 
 armed with Al Sisi, the former head of the Egyptian Golder Army, from 
 Little re -elected triumphantly for the third time, for the value 
 total of two billion and 39 million euros. According to the 
 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), in fact, 
 For 2024 3 billion dollars would already be at stake for 
 the purchase of twenty-four Eurofighter Typhoon-2 hunting hunting 
 of Cairo.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    The Leonardo 
 of the CEO Cingolani, former minister of 
 ecological transition, a company that has the minister in his book-Pag 
 Crosetto is rubbing hands for the umpteenth time.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    Industries 
 Italian war exported to the Egyptian Armed Forces in the 
 last five years weapons for the total value of 2 billion and 39 
 millions of euros.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    So, behind the 
 propaganda of this government, there is the substance of politics 
 Italian imperialist: antimmigratic profits and rejections.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    And against it it is 
 maximum proletarian opposition, mass, necessary, 
 Antimperialist, supportive with the armed resistance of peoples.
