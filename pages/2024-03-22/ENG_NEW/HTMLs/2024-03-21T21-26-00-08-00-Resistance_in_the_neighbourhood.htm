  The government has launched a pogrom of persecution, state violence and repression against struggles and fighters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Teachers are prosecuted and disciplined because they were involved in mobilizations in the time of the pandemic and against evaluation or because they publicly criticized the government's policy. They dismissed EKPA employee, persecuting the president of PENEN and the president of the Piraeus Labor Center, illegally strikes as soon as they are announced, striking the demonstrations with MAT and tear gas. They arrest students and drag them into the courts because they fight against private universities. They impose a climate of fascism, criminalize trade union action aimed at terrorizing, silencing any voice of resistance, but mainly target workers and all the people to bend their heads and accept the policy of poverty, poverty and participation in the country. Wars of imperialists as "regularity".
 </p>
 <p>
  The arrests of the 49 students and the slanderous lies of a "nuclear accident" that were channeled to the media, which was forced to deny the AUTH Rector himself, show that the system of exploitation and oppression does not hesitate to serve them in order to serve their targets. .
 </p>
 <p>
  The government and the parties of the system that support its policy will not stop unless we stop them with our mass struggles. They need to unfold struggles against the barbaric policy that is destroyed by us but also persecution and state violence and repression. Do not pass the persecutions and the climate of terrorism. With our common coordinated struggles we can put a brake on those who deprive us of the rights in life and subjugate our lives for the interests of the ruling class and its imperialist protectors.
