  The three major bourgeoisie-compradors announced their "integration" for the operation of the Ilijan LNG terminal, the first "integrated lng import facility" built by the Atlantic Gulf &amp; Amp; Pacific Company (AG &amp; amp; P) at the coast of Barangay Ilijan, Batangas City. Meralco Powergen, Aboitiz Power and San Miguel Global Power (SMGP) came together to buy such a facility for $ 3.3 billion (₱ 184 billion).
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ilijan LNG terminal covers nine hectares of terrain and up to 700 meters water from the coast for "floating storage" of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas). Except for the harbor and storage, it will also serve as a "regasification" facility. Such a natural gas facility will supply to the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) energy-owned energy-owned energy plant.
 </p>
 <p>
  This facility and plants include 12 "terminals" and 35 new energy plants plan to build imported lng and diesel. Seven of the terminals and eight of the new plants are set to be built on the coast of Batangas, in front of the Verde Island Passage (VIP). Others are planned to build in Leyte, Navotas City and Zamboanga. One of the plants, planned to be built on the coast of the Tañon Strait in San Carlos, Negros Occidental, was temporarily withdrawn by the protests of residents, church people and environmental groups. Many of the LNG projects are being pushed by SMC, including multinational Japanese, American and British institutions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Currently, six LNG plants are operational in the country, and five of them are on the coast of Batangas.
 </p>
 <h2>
  The US surplus dump
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Philippines has opened the import of LNG from 2021 in the face of reportingly approaching a natural gas reserve in the Malampaya gas fields in 2027. The US used it to push the country to import the LNG.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US has been the leading producer of LNG worldwide since 2011. It has passed Russia, Australia and Qatar and became the number one exporter for the first time in December 2023. This is the result of the US seizure of LNG sales in Western Europe (Germany, France, UK, and others) who had previously flowed into pipes from Russia. Aside from the US imposing its violation of LNG's purchase of Russia from the outbreak of war in Ukraine, it has even exploded the Nordstream pipeline so as not to smuggle LNG. The terminals had to be built to store LNG from the US which was carried to Western Europe aboard large ships.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ukraine's direct results in Ukraine's proxy warfare of LNG prices for $ 40 per million British thermal Unit (MMBTU) in 2022. However, due to LNG's over -production, prices have been dropped down to the global market for $ 9.80 per MMBTU in 2023.
 </p>
 <p>
  The US is now working to open new markets and monopolize the former Asian markets to become a dump of LNG and keep its demand and price high. American companies such as ExxonMobil, Novatek and Chevron are most attached to import LNG.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although LNG prices have dropped in the global market, it is only temporary and does not mean that it will lower electricity charges in the Philippines. In 2023, the imported LNG was $ 1- $ 3/MMBTU higher than local natural gas. In accordance with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the price of energy produced from imported lng. It is higher than the ₱ 7.38/kWh energy price from the same imported coal and diesel in 2023, and ₱ 4.4/kWh using local solar power.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite a certain higher charges, the Department of Energy has yet to require the acquisition of all power distributors from plants processing imported LNG. In accordance with the "energy map" of the Marcos regime, the Philippines will raise the use of imported LNG and "renewable" energy from 29% (of which 13%) to 35% by 2030 and 50% of 2050.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Threat to VIP and fishermen's livelihood
 </h2>
 <p>
  LNG is laid to be a "transition fuel" because it is cleaner compared to coal and diesel. However, it still creates greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In fact, studies appear to be more harmful to environmental its methane, as it has 80-100 times longer to lock the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide.
 </p>
 <p>
  The pandemya (2021) began and the construction of the Ilijan lng terminal ended in 2023. It was built by AG &amp; amp; P, a United Arab Emirates -based company, Osaka Gas and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. In February, the American Nebula Energy company bought the AG &amp; AMP; P division dedicated to LNG.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ilijan LNG terminal is the Batangas Combine Cycle Power Plant currently being built by SMGP in Sta. Rita, Batangas. Although a separate project, the two facilities will join and face both parts of the VIP.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a study of the natural group, the two facilities, and the other like, are in the VIP ecosystem that scientists regard as the "richest habitat marine" in the world. In construction alone, sediment and sand have affected the scope of the facility. Construction has disturbed the cycle and inhabited by fish and other sailors life not only in its immediate range, but throughout the VIP. This has resulted in further decline in the quality of coral reefs and the fall of the late fishermen.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from the damage to the ocean, the agricultural lands are also facing the case of illegal use of agricultural lands in the villages of Ilijan and De la Paz. It also has cases illegal cutting coconut trees in the area. In fact, the Department of Agriculture issued a "cease and desist order" against the company last year due to its lack of land use permit. All of these are shrugged by AG &amp; amp; P and Japan's banks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hundreds of fishermen in Batangas have long been affected by the operations of First Gen and SMC energy plants. Before the new plants and facilities began to be built, more than half had been deducted from the last fish (pounding and gallons) since 2019. They were even more trapped when fishing on coasts near the construction was banned.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, residents are worried about the possible leakage of the ocean, the VIP is especially vulnerable to strong and severe storms. The VIP from the damage caused by the oil leak from the SMC ship, the MT Princess Empress, last year.
 </p>
 <p>
  The air and water in Batangas are increasingly polluted with the coast of the polluted energy plants. The sailor life is also especially disturbed because the ships that will deliver imported lng will be thick.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many communities on the coast will lose their livelihood and even living. Among the two million Filipinos are directly in the VIP ocean wealth.
