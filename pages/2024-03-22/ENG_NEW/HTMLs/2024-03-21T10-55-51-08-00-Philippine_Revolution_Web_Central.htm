  Women's Day March 8, March 8, the women led by Gabriela, and various democratic organizations, to express their objection to the Charter Change (ChaCha) of the Marcos regime, and the call for rights, livelihoods and independence. They marched from España Avenue to Mendiola but were blocked by police at Morayta Creeks. They conducted a program in front of Far Eastern University.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the program, Gabriela loves a work that represents the "gift" of the Marcos regime to women with Chacha. Inside the box are snakes that symbolize 100% foreign owned, additional US military bases in the country, and extend the office of state officials. The box is wrapped in the US flag.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar actions were launched in the cities of Baguio, Calamba, Naga, Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod and Davao.
