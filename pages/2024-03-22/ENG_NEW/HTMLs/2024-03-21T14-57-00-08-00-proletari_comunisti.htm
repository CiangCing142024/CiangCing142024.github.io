     TO 
  February, on the order of the Egyptian Armed Forces, an area of 16 
 Square kilometers along the border with Gaza has been flattened. In progress 
  also the construction of a concrete barrier. Cairo denies, but the 
 fear is that the country prepares the arrival of hundreds of thousands of 
 displaced Palestinians.

     From the concrete cages along the wall that separates Gaza from Egypt two 
 Egyptian soldiers sign that they do not take photos of work means. To the 
  Rafah pass, next to the entrance for humanitarian trucks, there is one 
 scraper. Other means are glimpsed in the nearby fields.

     As soon as 
  One kilometer south of the pass, in early February an entire disappeared 
  Agricultural area: an imperfect rectangle, four kilometers for 
 four, for a total of 16 square km, at the border. It is as if the 
 cut in two: one piece runs along the extreme south of Gaza, another 
 piece along the Israeli territory.

     That flattened was not there. Appeared a month ago, the 
 Sinai Foundation for Human Rights. On February 14, he reported to 
  works for the construction of an area isolated from a wall, «
     <em>
      Between the Rafah's pass and that of Kerem Shalom to the east and between the villages of Qoz ABO Raad and El-Masora to the west

  Dissure the 16 square km of the bare land will be a concrete wall 
 seven meters high, with strengthened safety, the same one that is already seen 
 In the north Sinai: from October more checkpoints, more soldiers.

 people. Probably many more: Rafah develops on 64 square km

     Available, to want to predict it, there is also New Rafah, the city 
 Ghost: empty buildings, 10 thousand apartments for families 
 Egyptian hunted by old Rafah that Al-Sisi has emptied with blows of 
  evictions and bulldozers. The buildings meet along the road, in

 Aid at the entrance to Gaza and that the esplanade area will serve by humanitarian hub 
  To store help, host drivers, manage logistics. A 
 project, however, of which humanitarian organizations and have never heard 
  speak.

     The 
  President Al-Sisi has always denied, since it started 
 The offensive by the Israeli land in late October, which pushed south 
  The vast majority of the Gazawi: Egypt will not take charge 
 of the Palestinian refugees, of a second Nakba 75 years after the first.

  February 22 The International Monetary Fund, which with the regime 
 Egyptian has been engaged for years in an arm wrestling on loans in 
 change of reforms tears and blood for a people already in misery, had 
 spoken of a "
     <em>
      very large support package

  The director of the FMI department for the Middle East, Jihad

     THE 
  Palestinians, for their part, insist: we don't leave. From the Cairo ce 
 Basel Sourani of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights repeats this: «
     <em>
      Despite 
  The illegal orders of Israeli evacuation, bombs and hunger, 400 thousand 
 Palestinians managed to stay in the north. There are thousands of people 
  Today in Egypt, but there are many more inside Gaza

     About 
  15 thousand the Gazawi entered in recent months in Egyptian territory, 
 Very few: go out is a lottery, and you pay dearly, $ 5,000 a 
 head.

     It is true, however, that Gaza is no longer there: "
     <em>
      70% of infrastructure and houses are destroyed
     </em>
     »Says Adnan Abu Hasna, a spokesman for UNRWA in Gaza. An unlivable place but he too is said to be sure: "
     <em>
      Making them
