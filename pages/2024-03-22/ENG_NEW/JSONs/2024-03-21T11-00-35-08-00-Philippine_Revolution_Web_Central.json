The peasant masses were full of wrath in the midst of their poverty and hunger, fascism and land seizure of the reactionary regime to their grievances.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In a desperate attempt to \"end\" the revolutionary armed resistance of the Filipino people, the terrorist and fascist devastation of the US-Marcos regime and its armed tentacles nationwide are now endless. Expect Marcos and the AFP's false declarations to the \"insurgency-free\" of various provinces, especially in the provinces that are destined to enter and adopt foreign companies in mining, plantation and plantation and energy. At the mandate of US imperialism, the AFP was also in a hurry to \"end\" the armed struggle of the Filipino people so that the US military could fully use the AFP in its war in China which is likely to be the late year.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A whole war was recently ordered by Marcos and the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). This is the purpose of this alliance with the dismantling of all the NPA guerrillas at the end of March, destroy all NPA balcony units at the end of June, and consume all regional party committees before the end of the year. A thousand military troops, co-workers' police troops and the ten thousand paramilitary armed by the AFP, were sent to roast in the countryside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hundreds of villages are being charged by Marcos' fascists. The ruling soldier controls the lives and livelihoods of the people, shuts their mouths, and tramples their rights and freedoms. Decorations and Food Blocks, Prohibition Farmers or Climbing Barangay Armed Soldiers, Home-Homes and Forcing To \"Surrender,\" bullying girls or even married people, drinking, beating, beating And blowing up, firing a gun everywhere-just a few of the rotten ones that make the people think. In the midst of drought and disasters, fascist soldiers are pests that have no other but harmful to their communities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Using strong weapons, drones and jetfighter, helicopters and Howitzers, the bombing of Marcos's terrorist soldiers in the mountains and fields that damages the wealth of the jungle and poisoned the water, break It brings deep anxiety to the people, especially children, pregnant and older. It has been a great destination for life, contrary to all principles and laws in civilized warfare.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Marcos aims to aim for fear on the people's chest and to destroy them as they are being robbed by large alien capitalists and accomplice comprador bourgeoisie and big landlords. But instead of falling into the ground, they were even more aware of standing and fighting, and wasting the path of the armed revolution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the guerrillas across the country, the units of the New People's Army (NPA) are continuing to enjoy the deep and broad support of the peasant masses. The AFP military officials and the reactionary state are furious that despite their intensity-war-aged for almost seven years, the peasant masses have continued to provide political and material support to the Red fighters. Young peasants, as well as young students, workers and professionals, also continue to join the People's Army.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The people's desire to advance the armed struggle continues to fire. In the midst of the fascist involvement of the armed tentacles of the US-Marcos regime, and its burdens of policies further hurting them, the peasant's mind and awareness of the masses are more aware that they do not have anything if they do not have a new people's army in defense in their lives and rights, and with them in the struggle for land and livelihood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In recent years, the NPA has suffered damage and withdrawal from various parts of the country due to errors and weaknesses of conservatism and unity in its previous success. Instead of daring to undermine the path of continuous expansion and stimulation of the armed struggle, the scope and mass of the guerrilla units of guerrilla units, became passive and vulnerable to the siege of the enemy. In the Party's guide and inspiration, the NPA is determined to correct the mistakes and advance the path of strengthening and blaming the fire of the people's war.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the spirit of the correction movement, the NPA must stimulate the armed struggle in all parts of the country. Participation is a broad mass movement in guerrilla warfare, use all weapons - shooting and rock, spear and spit, spit and explosion - and launch large or small tactical offensives that can succeed against the vulnerable and isolated parts of the enemy. Enemies the fascist troops of the enemy and all its tentacles as a way of achieving the people of justice and to inspire their resistance. Only through extensive armed resistance can the NPA can be strengthened and advanced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since the establishment, five and a half decades ago, the NPA has served as the true town army that promotes the revolutionary intent of the Filipino people for national democracy. In its upcoming anniversary on March 29, we will celebrate the achievements that have been achieved over the last 55 years, pay homage to all martyrs and heroes, and re-determine the determination to advance the long-term people's war, any sacrifice and pain is needed , to achieve success in the future.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-53080\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" src=\"https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240321.ang-bayan-editorial-cartoon.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://philippinerevolution.nu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240321.ang-bayan-editorial-cartoon.jpeg\"/>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "zip_content": null, "zip_links": [], "source": "https://philippinerevolution.nu/2024/03/21/armadong-pakikibaka-ang-sagot-sa-pasismo-ng-rehimeng-us-marcos/", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "type": "article", "title": "PRWC \u00bbArmed struggle is the answer to the US-Marcos regime's fascism", "description": "The Filipino people's feelings against the US-Marcos regime are burning in all fascist involvement throughout the country, especially in the countryside.
