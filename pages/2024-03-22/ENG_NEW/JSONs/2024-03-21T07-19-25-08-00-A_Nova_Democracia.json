According to the information that was leaked to the press, Ronnie Lessa gave the name of those who hired him and the context of the meetings she had before and after the crime. Thus, the person responsible for triggering the gun trigger that murdered the former councilwoman delivered details that have been clarified six years. According to the Minister of Justice Lewandowski, the approval indicates that \u201cwe will soon have the solution\u201d of the case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ronnie Lessa began to collaborate with the court in August 2023, shortly after learning that \u00c9lcio de Queiroz handed over her name as the crime executor. Lessa, who is in an isolated cell in the Campo Grande Penitentiary (MS), gave a two -hour testimony. In it, the former military police officer provided a series of evidence, circumstances and evidence not only of his involvement in the execution of the double murder, but mainly about those behind the commission of the deaths. Now what justice has in hand is the one who hired Ronnie Lessa to execute the former councilor, and with whom the executor gathered.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to Ronnie Lessa, the principals are part of a powerful political group of RJ, with broad presence in various sectors of the state. One of the cited is Chiquinho Brazil. Federal Deputy for Uni\u00e3o Brasil, Chiquinho campaigned for Jair Bolsonaro in 2022. He is also the brother of Domingos Braz\u00e3o, the Court of Auditors of RJ, and Pedro Braz\u00e3o, state deputy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Domingos Braz\u00e3o, involved with militias since the early 2000s, is named as the intellectual mentor of the murders. Domingos tried to obstruct Marielle's murder investigation process in 2019 (before the case was federalized) and had previously been removed in 2017 for corruption involvement. K\u00e1ssio Nunes Marques (Supreme Court Minister appointed by Jair Bolsonaro) determined the resumption of the counselor's activities, placing him in a more armored condition for investigations, re-featuring \u201cprivileged forum\u201d.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Ronnie Lessa's lawyers abandon the case after her client closes the agreement\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Ronnie Lessa's lawyers said they will no longer continue to defend the paramiltar. In a press release, they stated that the decision is motivated \"by legal ideology\": \"Not acting to whistleblowers is a principle, pre-case issue, and has nothing to do with any interest in the solution or not of a particular crime.\"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Curious \u201cLegal Ideology\u201d This: Alright defending the professional killer Ronnie Lessa. No problem! As long as he doesn't denounce.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Ronnie Lessa and \u00c9lcio de Queiroz: linked to the Bolsonaro family\n </h3>\n <p>\n  Both stand out for having a common biographical trait: Ronnie Lessa lived in the same condominium as Jair Bolsonaro, Barra da Tijuca. Lessa's daughter dated Bolsonaro's youngest son. Ronnie Lessa also stated, at the beginning of the investigations, that those who executed Marielle was Adriano da Nobrega, then head of the paramilitary group \u201cOffice of Crime\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Already \u00c9lcio de Queiroz, who chose Lessa as \u201cgodfather of consideration of her son\u201d, has also lived in the same condominium as Bolsonaro. \u00c9lcio de Queiroz is a former military police officer of RJ and also involved with \u201cmilitia, bicheiros, traffickers and smugglers\u201d according to investigations by the Civil and Military Police.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Before becoming a professional killer, Ronnie Lessa served in the army and was a military and civil police officer. The relationship between Queiroz and Lessa, who had already been known since before serving the PM, was strengthened after being expelled from the corporation for involvement with paramilitary groups.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This relationship between official repression forces, paramilitary groups, offenders and smugglers is not limited to the names mentioned here. Ronnie Lessa participated in A Scuderie Le Cocq (SLC), a well -known extermination group founded in 1965 in the RJ that gathered military police. The founders of SLC were linked to the government of the time. They were used to do a work of \u201celimination\u201d of criminals, residents of street and transvestites.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Throughout the military regime, Scuderie - or the death squad, as it has also become known - also fulfilled the role of selective elimination of political militants. Other members of the \u201cdeath squad\u201d are loose and active.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A total of 17 military police were arrested on March 20 for providing services to Bicheiro Rog\u00e9rio de Andrade. This whole structure needs to be properly investigated and punished. Another example of a bicheiro that maintains spurious relationships is \u201cCaptain Guimar\u00e3es\u201d: the military man who was expelled for involvement with \u201csmuggling\u201d and today sends and clears in the animal game and carnival, brings together allegations of political militants from the time of the military regime that counted The Truth Commission that were tortured by Guimar\u00e3es during an instructional course for military.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It must be clear what all these facts show us: There are many other figures that have made paintings of the Military Police or Army that make up the far right, paramilitary groups and agents of state repression.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/caso-marielle-deputado-bolsonarista-e-apontado-como-mandante-em-delacao-homologada-pelo-stf/", "type": "article", "title": "Marielle Case: Bolsonarist Deputy is appointed as a mastermind in a report approved by the STF - the new democracy", "description": "According to the information that was leaked to the press, Ronnie Lessa gave the name of those who hired him and the context of the meetings she had before and after the crime.", "modified time": "2024-03-20T20:33:12-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-20T20:33:12-03:00", "author": ["Jo\u00e3o Alves"], "categories": ["Nacional"], "tags": ["caso marielle"], "sections": ["Nacional"], "link-section": "nacional", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
