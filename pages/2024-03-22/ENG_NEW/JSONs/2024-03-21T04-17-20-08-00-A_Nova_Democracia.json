The information was revealed by Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The documents accessed by the monopolistic newspaper indicate that one of the actions was entitled \u201cCalled for an interministerial and intersectoral campaign\u201d, and sought to articulate different sectors in an act of condemnation of the coup. Another act sought a series of \u201cformal reparations\u201d, as a public apology from the different ministries to those who suffered for the military regime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They are unquestionably shy initiatives, but what stands out most in the picture is not the lack of voluptuousness of actions planned by the human rights portfolio, but as Luiz Inacio ordered the end of these purely institutional initiatives, which would directly affect the barracks. No reactionary military man would be forced to take part in the \u201cpublic apology\u201d, for example.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And if the government capitulates even in movements like these, what else can be expected? If the presidency does not want to gather ministers for a retraction on behalf of the Brazilian State, who can expect bodies such as the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (extinct in Bolsonaro's government), which investigates the crimes of the military regime and cast more light in Will torturers and murderers of the military regime be reopened by the current government?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Moreover, another central question is raised again: if the government feels so shy to formally condemn the coup 60 years ago, as it will fight\n  <em>\n   in fact\n  </em>\n  The coup today? According to some in the government, Luiz Inacio \"discouraged\" the military to celebrate the military coup, but the kind request did not work. In Rio, the Military Club has already marked an event to celebrate the date, which will have as a speaker a general known for the pro-64 positions and pro-intervention of the barracks in national political life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Bring to the Bank of the Defendants some generals and other senior mandates burned by the proximity to the Bolsonarist Center, which is a cause for the government's boost in recent weeks, it is not the highest fight against coup, no matter how necessary. The fight against coup necessarily permeates the conception present in the reactionary armed forces since the founding of the Republic that they are the true moderating power\n  <strong>\n  </strong>\n  of the nation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This conception is not exclusive to those who drive institutional rupture in 2022, precisely because it is a nuclear part of the Brazilian reactionary forces and being passed on generation after generation in training courses. Freire Gomes, for example, former army commander who allegedly opposed the break in 2022, signed the note that, besides showing support for camps in front of the barracks, argued that the Armed Forces were\n  <a href=\"https://www.cms.eb.mil.br/index.php/noticias/as-instituicoes-e-ao-povo-brasileiro#:~:text=sempre%20presentes%20e%20moderadoras%20nos%20mais%20importantes%20momentos%20de%20nossa%20hist%C3%B3ria\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   \u201cAlways present and moderators in the most important moments of our history\u201d\n  </a>\n  .
