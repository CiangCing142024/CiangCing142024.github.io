Typical examples are the invasion of MAT, OPKE and other police forces to break the squatters in various schools nationwide, wood and chemicals on the marches, the imposition of tele-examinations for the removal of the student movement, and the very recent arrests 49 Students of the AUTH at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   Of course this is not the first time this has happened. Every time a people and youth dare to challenge the government and the rotten, exploitative system they represent, they find the various repressive mechanisms they have to hit the collective and organized old and the militants. It is precisely this line the persecutions against teachers for political and trade union action are also moved. This is a very serious issue related to the general direction of terrorism and suppression of militants, associations and movements, arising from the policy of fascisting public and political life.\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   In this context, therefore, and in the need to connect the students' struggle with the workers, members of the racing moves have submitted a resolution to the BoD to support the mobilization of 21/3 at the Piraeus Municipal Theater. The PCF forces voted against it using cheap excuses. Overcoming the decisions by ELME that support the call, it has \"annoyed\" that the concentration is supported by organizations and colleges. This is probably by their logic impossible to discuss this and to be supported by a student club. They even presented a contradictory call to the Ministry of Education.\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   The same forces that act as a fire extinguisher of the movement and racing moods of the student masses, which have been on the road continuously for 10 weeks and which in some cases have supported them and DAP members, decided to stop the occupations. And not to enter new general assemblies and demonstrations. Teachers also take a similar attitude within the unions and do not support the mobilization, which is surrounded by trade unions and collectives and a variety of uninhabited world in the neighborhoods, while their own competitors are being prosecuted.\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n   It turns out once again that in every effort to resist and claim the world, in every attempt to build a movement with truly racing characteristics they try to sabotage it. They oppose anything that goes beyond their virtual protests and can be a real obstacle to the attack of the system.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"672\" data-original-width=\"1920\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgg_6yHCuPLnFyyJvoIQjl0AYuS3BwvTEJWfOOIzYnfokQk4aPx6WRgTuHXCUThVRovI3a6ZfGVEfyr9j7pk56Jzw_eRG5ls3FIhF3ovukgimHXYMMwml7IcvyKGW2eCPLPUSO8izmUEnOGJ7sXnkym386VZBex-xi_BCy44H0F8piomkDHMnwbef2shtw/s1920/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgg_6yHCuPLnFyyJvoIQjl0AYuS3BwvTEJWfOOIzYnfokQk4aPx6WRgTuHXCUThVRovI3a6ZfGVEfyr9j7pk56Jzw_eRG5ls3FIhF3ovukgimHXYMMwml7IcvyKGW2eCPLPUSO8izmUEnOGJ7sXnkym386VZBex-xi_BCy44H0F8piomkDHMnwbef2shtw/s1920/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" width=\"320\"/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   Republished by\n   <a href=\"https://www.agonistikeskiniseis.org/i-kne-katapsifizei-psifismata-allileggyis-se-ekpaideytikoys-poy-diokontai/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Racing moves\n   </a>\n  </div>\n  <br/>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd", "\u039a\u039d\u0395"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_67.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
