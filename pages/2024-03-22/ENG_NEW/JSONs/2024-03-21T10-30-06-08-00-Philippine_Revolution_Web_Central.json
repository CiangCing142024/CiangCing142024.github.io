These todies are supposed to hear all of the NPA guerrilla fronts at the end of March, will break all NPA units at the end of June, and all the regional party committees will be the end of the year. You are collected thousands of military troops, the police and thousands of paramilitars are invited to the AFP, the Gideployer to get rid of the countryside.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Hundreds of villages were Gurarison in Marcos' fascist gatherings.
