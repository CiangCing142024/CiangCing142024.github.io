Representing the military right, the ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mour\u00e3o had no doubts: \u201cHe\u2019s right, that\u2019s the past,\u201d he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Estad\u00e3o [newspaper], used to criticizing Luiz In\u00e1cio, was quick to defend him: \u201cLula acts correctly\u201d by refusing to talk about the 1964 coup in its 60 years, in line with \u201can imperative of governability in a context of wounds waiting to heal\u201d and \u201cit is also a way of honoring the current military command, also architect of pacification\u201d, he stated in the editorial \u201cLula\u2019s accommodation with the military\u201d (March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estad\u00e3o, which has already advocated for the government to reopen the Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances (CEMDP), something that Luiz In\u00e1cio refuses to do, capitulates by echoing this government\u2019s cowardly complicity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only the reactionary ideologues \u2013 committed above all to the continued exploitation of the people and the Nation \u2013 and the opportunists, whose mentality has been emasculated by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of the popular masses, believe that appeasement will lead to the stabilization of the country.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the results of the elections (2018) by taking away Luiz In\u00e1cio from the race, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote on that candidate in the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As we see: long before Bolsonaro took the presidency \u2013 and independently of him \u2013 the latent wound of the coup was again manifesting itself acutely, especially because it had not been properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with the gorillas and transition with the Amnesty military regime of General and Unrestricted Amnesty, led in which there was no punishment, no change in the high military officials, nor in the training curriculums, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which they followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as \u201cdemocratic revolution\u201d, and when it was removed from the front of management of the old State, it took back the belief that the Armed Forces were the Moderating Power and guarantors of the \u201cDemocratic State of Law\u201d \u2013 and, therefore, also guarantors of its restriction or even suspension, as Bolsonaro shamelessly tried to do.\n  </p>\n  <p p=\"\">\n   <p>\n    When Luiz In\u00e1cio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on. When the masses rise up in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, the gorillas, as the Moderating Power they believe in, will rise again threatening the Country with military intervention to save the Nation from \u201cdisintegration\u201d. Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and weakened, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup escalation.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Appeasement with the military leadership only feeds the coup!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    For genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, as well as the popular masses in struggle, there is no other path left than to forcefully raise the campaign to denounce the 60 years of the ignominious coup of 1964 and the coup, whether in the form of institutional rupture or in the form of \u201cModerating Power\u201d. Compromises with fascists and coup plotters are not acceptable \u2013 which would only lead us to coup and fascism.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/03/21/and-weekly-editorial-appeasement-only-feeds-coupism/", "type": "article", "title": "AND: Weekly editorial \u2013 Appeasement only feeds coupism \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "When Luiz In\u00e1cio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on.", "modified time": "2024-03-21T22:23:12+00:00", "author": ["T.I."], "categories": ["Featured", "The Americas"], "tags": ["AND", "Brazil"], "sections": ["Featured", "The Americas", "AND", "Brazil", "English", "pll_65fcb3930e65a"], "source_name": "Red Herald"}
