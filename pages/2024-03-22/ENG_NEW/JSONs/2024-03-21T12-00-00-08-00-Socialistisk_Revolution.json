But as soon as they have left a previously controlled area, the people even restore their armed forces and resume the fight. In this way, IDF goes from defeat to defeat and struggles a wear and tear they will never be able to win. The only thing they are able to murder the masses in Gaza and try to starve them, but it will ultimately only push even more into the ranks of the freedom fighters as the choice between\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    to fight\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n  or\n  <em>\n   Complete extinction\n  </em>\n  being painted up black on white. The defeat of Israel and the viability of the freedom fighters is ultimately proof that Hamas, p.f.l.p. And other freedom fighters have the support of the masses and their battalions are made up of the people who fight and resist. Therefore, each bomb is Israel throwing the backlash and their tanks will only turn into steel chests for IDF pigs.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/israel-kan-ikke-opretholde-kontrol-i-det-nordlige-gaza/", "type": "article", "title": "Israel cannot maintain control in northern Gaza", "description": "Israeli Military, IDF, continues their brutal folk killing against the Palestinian people.
