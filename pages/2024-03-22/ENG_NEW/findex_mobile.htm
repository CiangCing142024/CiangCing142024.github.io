<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b6d72869d8a48ec57d0d017f572bd17b">
  We share this political statement made by some independent and revolutionary student organizations due to the election of rector in some public universities of the country:
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7130c1e56364a7fc8422ccc17b3abb30">
  The designation of Rector, in the public universities of the country, has revived to some extent, the debates around the autonomy and democracy of these institutions, although some organizational processes are choosing to allocate their efforts to campaign to a candidate or other , it can be said that firstly, this process is substantially antidemocratic, and therefore, under methods that privilege the domes of the administrative bureaucracy, which what it does is designate a position that accommodates already predisposed policies.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2f3a1f15ec68332d17498314f9f9d265">
  Thus, a good part of the university community distrusts these methods, which have allowed us to play for a better education and for better working conditions in universities. The rectory is not chosen by students, but are chosen by sectors that precisely today do not correspond to the interests of the main levels of the university (private sector, national government, local government, exrector and bureaucratic representations of the teacher and student sector). The structural changes that could benefit the students and the IES workers, will not be built by the rectories, which, given the imperialist impositions of organisms such as the OECD or the IMF that deteriorate education and put it at the service of the system, no They can greatly impact the root problem.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ca44a0ebaeaa40204d8981587c4336af">
  On the other hand, we understand the aspiration of many students to promote the candidacies of certain figures that apparently collect elements of the struggles of the university movement in their programs, therefore, we support the democratic slogan that in the universities where they have won candidates with programs that They collect some of the claims of the student sector, the consultation is respected. However, we make a special emphasis on the fact that this process is antidemocratic, and the rectors are limited by the material conditions of the country with respect to the possible changes they can make, also understanding, that from the CSU respond more to the interests of hegemonic sectors.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b0361ff53acc99bab08c44a235249d02">
  Understanding all this, it is possible to ask ourselves, can participate there give us the possibility of influencing the type of education that our people needs and the course of universities? Is the current system of consultations to the estates really democratic? It is enough to see who are the few people who can really choose a rector in the Higher University Council (CSU), the absence of students in construction spaces in bureaucratic tables and decisive estates, and the abstention figures in the consultations, which by Example, this year at the University of Antioquia they reached 66% in professors and more than 85% in students. These issues reflect the little relevance of this process for the university community, and the pathetic show that is organized to mask a vote that is not binding but merely symbolic, of a democratic mask.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-854a9a6fd77d3d63382b900b5788e6a9">
  Before the class conciliation policy that has been developed, and the absence of independent mobilization and organization spaces, students and workers have to concentrate efforts against the main enemies of our class, and in the same way this union in defense of our interests must result in a minimum program for action. Polyitic parties should not have interference in our program, because we know that they only act according to their opportunistic interests, as happened with former leaders of the student movement who were related to different parties and turned their backs on the fight for a position in the bureaucracy of the State.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4602f71d3bf5166e3ec1a7c75b514f1f">
  In that sense, we demand a binding and direct participation in the process of the rectoral elections, that the university community decides autonomously, critically and democratically who will occupy this position, and not a bureaucratic quota for the benefit of a few. In addition, we do not consider that the student movement should be reduced to being an appendix to make political campaign to one or another candidate. We must maintain our political and class independence, strengthen the organization and grassroots processes such as assemblies, student councils, union organizations and true representations that collect the interests of the student body.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1a7286c97b3062b51bf452104c0d1fd8">
  Thus, we propose that so far we have conquered our rights to the heat of the organized struggle, never putting our forces and illusions in agents external to the movement, but trusting in our own forces. The organized struggle has been the only way to lead us to a wide democracy, where we participate and influence decisions and the future of education.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ad795693b4b9e8e60a1f1879a6c8c6ca">
  Ultimately, you should never forget that the rectors correspond to specific interests, being crucial to question whether they can act autonomously. Precisely, university autonomy must be an element to lift the historical fighting flags of the student movement and put education at the service of popular classes.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-faee3318f445682185fa30097bda45a4">
  The student movement must claim its autonomy regarding capital to build a critical, scientific and proletarian university. We cannot limit ourselves to supporting the forms of participation of liberal democracy, which restrict political action to vote or to be part of bureaucratic tables. It is in the organizational processes and in the base spaces that the true student struggle and a real construction of power are gestated. We invite you to avoid adapting to bourgeois democracy and initiating the construction of a true university democracy through the organization in diverse union spaces and participation in general, student and multi -state assemblies.

<strong>
    Definitely scary!
   </strong>
   It does not spend a year without the femicides figures for various reasons and everything under the real inoperance of the state that hypocritically serves as a woman's defender, but in reality it is its main oppressor.
  </p>
<p>
   Femicides at the hands of their fellow or sentimental partners, even for the most futile causes, such as small domestic affairs, when they supposedly love them or loved them, although it is also known, that many women feel forced to live with colleagues who do not want.
  </p>
<p>
   And it is that this State, precisely because of its character, bourgeois, landowner and pro-imperialist, that is, for being at the service of the ruling classes and imperialism, it hardly fulfills its role as guarantor of the safety and integrity of women and not It goes from speaking of protocols and offering some lines to prevent such facts, but that never work and finally the woman is in a state of helplessness with respect to her perpetrators.
  </p>
<p>
   To this is added the infamous war against the people freed by the army, the guerrillas and the paramilitaries, who, in blood and fire, do not cease to snatch the lands to the peasantry to rise with the production of psychotropics and by the runners to get them to the Market, as well as mining and other agroindustrial crops, along with the juicy weapons business. War in the midst of whose massacres and torture, women, in addition, are subjected by mass, violations and all kinds of vexars, and where the State is nothing more than complicit of land expropriators, as happened during the government of the government of the government Mafia, where the Attorney General's Office, which should prosecute both the massacres, and femicides and violations, was openly at the service of the mafia regime.
  </p>
<p>
   Nor can we ignore the lack of a serious study of this phenomenon, because to the innumerable investigators, the abysmal differences in the figures of victims that each report is added; Not only should there be a single victim, but neither confusion about those figures, because this prevents becoming an objective idea of the situation.
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, in the face of consummated facts, justice is not only extremely slow to resolve, but around it, extreme cases such as feminicide receive the house by jail, thus revictimizing women.
  </p>
<p>
   With this panorama as violent as terrifying, the only beneficiaries are feminicides and the capitalist system because the situation of women, not only remains the same, but also worsens, given the increase in violence in public spaces, because of the women are intimidated and submitted with terror.
  </p>
<p>
   In conclusion, the situation of women in the midst of this capitalist society, unable to guarantee not only their rights, but their physical and moral integrity, is shouting for revolution!, Which, as the teachers of the proletariat and how it is ratified in each fight of the struggle of our class for our liberation, it is your definitive response.
  </p>
<p>
   For this reason, to pave the way to this objective, from the ranks of the Communist Obrera Union (MLM), we call all the women of Colombia to participate in the revolutionary female movement that we are promoting, which begins by deciding to fight shoulder To shoulder with the men of our class, today for our economic, political and social claims for tomorrow to move forward in the total and deep transformation of this society, because contrary to bourgeois feminism, only then will we reach our own liberation.
  </p>

  On March 18, about 100 squatters from Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabii, Monteiro, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa d'Agua, Tenório and Sítio Grande, located in the rural area of Jaqueira, Pernambuco (PE), Morcego, Tenório and Sítio Grande, Organized by the League of Poor Peasants (LCP), they joined to resume their sources of water that were surrounded by the Mata Sul Agricultural Latiface, belonging to the Guilherme Maranhão landowner.

<p>
  Since 2015, when theft of lands and water sources began, peasants live and produce in the lands of the former Frei Caneca plant. Latifundry Guilherme Maranhão supported by former governor Paulo Camara, installed pistolage groups that threaten the entire population to expand cutting cattle for international export through the Masterboi refrigerator.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the extensive evidence of water poisoning with pesticides launched by landlords (in addition to contamination of sources with feces and cattle urine), the Pernambuco Public Prosecutor's Office (MPPE) and the Pernambuco State Secretariat of Environment (CPR) never opened any Criminal inquiry against the agricultural Latifundia Mata Sul S/A.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, the peasants decided in a popular assembly to perform a great act to resume the water sources of the landlord. The call reached the entire population of the municipality with leafleting at the fairs and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts for cleaning and demarcating the water sources, 50 meters away from cattle breeds and landlipping plantations.

  To do all this work, the squatters had the support of the peasants of the revolutionary area José Ricardo and the young students of the Mangue Vermelho Movement. They helped clean the bush and mark the fences to protect the water sources under the scorching sun. In addition, they faced the landlords of the landowners with all people with all people.

  As soon as the peasants ended the effort of the first source of the day, with a lot of struggle, singing popular songs and shouting slogans, half a dozen landowner gunmen appeared with tractor, pickups, motorcycles and quadricycles. The gunmen arrived with piles, wires and eucalyptus seedlings to install in the same area as the peasants just cleaned. When the peasant march crossed with the bad guys, the latifundal envoys threatened the peasants with firearms. The tension resulted in confrontation, and three gunmen were injured and a estate drone was shattered by the popular fury masses against the gun
 </p>
<p>
  On the same March 18, the agrarian prosecutor of the MPPE, the CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee on the Monitoring of Agricultural Conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the Pastoral Land Commission (CPT) and the Federation of Workers and Farmers of Pernambuco ( Fetape), Mayor Ridete Pellegrino and Jaqueira councilors, as well as lawyers of the Mata Sul Agricultural Latiface, made visits to investigate complaints from the landowner against the peasants. According to information, this commission did not visit the water sources of the peasants, only the places indicated by the landowners.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the peasant action of the peasants forced the whole commission to present itself at the scene of the act and accept two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Lawyers (Abrapo) and the president of the Barro Branco Picners Association in the Commission and still had to accept the terms of the people at the audience that needed to mobilize the hurry.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, the MPPE accepted a proposal of the peasants represented by Abrapo for the creation of “waters”, to demarcate all sources of water to the people. The landowner was summoned to pay for the stakes and wires, the city will send employees to perform the work and the State Secretariat of Environment was to examine the waters of the people to determine the contamination and open criminal inquiry against landlord.
 </p>
<p>
  After the hearing, Guilherme Maranhão gunmen asked the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to be reinforced to plant eucalyptus in one of the water sources that the peasants had cleaned in task force and the lawyer of the landlord Eduardo Figueredo announced that they will perform military action to expel peasant families from areas near the woods.
 </p>
<p>
  Two vehicles were sent to make the safety of the gunmen to continue acting against the people. This is not an act of courage, but of cowardice in the face of the small demonstration of strength of the united peasants and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how the military forces of this old state are committed to protecting the interests of landowners and promoting misfortunes for the poor population of the countryside and the city.
 </p>
<p>
  The squatters of the lands of the former Frei Caneca plant are determined to resume all their sources of water and their lands back from the land of the landlord. Thus, they call all peasants in the South Mata Zone of Pernambuco to rise against the pistolage groups of the landlords and the military forces of this old state. Without destroying the landlord there will never be justice to the poor people of the countryside.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  A new genius/Quaest research, conducted from March 14 to 18, revealed that the assessment of the “market” about how the economy in Luiz Inácio went up, and is above the popular evaluation of the same sector. Of the 101 shareholders, “
  <em>
   traders
  </em>
  ”, Bourgeois economists and investors consulted, 50% consider the role of Finance Minister Fernando Haddad as positive. The data draw attention when compared to other recent research, such as Atlas Intel, which revealed that 53% of the population negatively evaluates the economy.
 </p>
<p>
  Luiz Inácio, by itself, was evaluated as positive by only 6%, a drop of 3% compared to the latest survey. Another 64% considered the agent's performance as negative (a 12% increase) and 39% as regular (9% fall). Haddad's work was judged as positive for 50% (an increase of 7%), regular by 38% (5% increase) and negative by 12% (falling 12%).
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Luiz Inácio and Haddad: What's the difference?
 </h4>
<p>
  They are somewhat contrasting, but reflecting an artificial division of the government, as if there was an abyss between Luiz Inacio and Fernando Haddad.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course there are differences in government, even within the petista summit. Figures like Haddad, for example, have opted from the beginning by prioritizing sectors of the great bourgeoisie more directly aligned and fostered by imperialism and financial capital. Others, such as the president of BNDES, Aloizio Mercadante, and Luiz Inacio himself, tend to prioritize other sectors of the great bourgeoisie, also subjected to imperialism, but also different from the bonds and promotion extracted from state incentives, and use from the state to leverage bureaucratic capitalism.
 </p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, the agent did not oppose projects that directly benefited, or at least sought to affect, the shareholders of imperialism, such as the taxation of the taxation of
  <em>
   offshores
  </em>
  assembled by Haddad (approved with a
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/projeto-de-taxacao-das-offshores-aprovado-por-governo-e-congresso-e-para-ingles-ver/">
   ABSURD DISCOUNT TO SHALL
  </a>
  , a true privilege to the sector denounced by several economists), the tax reform and the tax framework itself, a pleasing to all sectors of the great bourgeoisie. In January 2024, Luiz Inácio even stated that Haddad could be "the best Finance Minister in the country."
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Financial leeches
 </h4>
<p>
  What the shareholders interviewed reveal, thus, in the research, is greed itself: even with the government support for the approval of the vast majority of projects they have taken as centrals in 2023, the "market" vultures follow more benefits search for more benefits. and new ways for the sagging of public coffers. Therefore, they badly assess Luiz Inacio, despite the agent commitment of the agent with the plans of the Minister of Finance, and support Haddad effusively, in an attempt to make clear the
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/editorial-semanal-dois-programas-reacionarios-em-contenda/">
   reactionary program that prefer
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The same is true of other rates, such as the disapproval of 97% of interviewees from Petrobras's decision not to pay extraordinary dividends (payment that would impair several basic operations of the company, which already pays the highest dividends when compared to several oil companies multinationals) and the accusation that the greatest risk of the current government is "interventionism." They are true leeches, patrons of large companies and “independent” institutions (such as the Central Bank) so that they can submit them to the maximum of the wishes of financial capital.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Market evaluates government better than the people
 </h4>
<p>
  In this picture, such a negative assessment of the “market” could even be regarded as a compliment to Luiz Inacio, if it were not for other variables: these positive points that could be extracted from the recent research are lost when considered that the people evaluate the economic situation of the country Worse than the market, a clear sign of whom the economic policy of the current government serves. According to the Atlas Intel survey released in recent weeks, 53% of respondents consider it to be bad. The new data was a 5% increase in the previous survey of January, and it was the first time in the current government that the negative assessment of the economy exceeded 50%. Another data, this one from Quaest survey, conducted on February 27, showed that 73% of respondents realized a rise in prices, compared to 48% of the previous survey.
 </p>
<p>
  In other words, while market assessment of the economy in the current government has advanced, the people's perception of the same area has been growing disapproval. The explanation can be given by simple ways: at the time the shareholders see their projects served, the people are still waiting for the so far and expected campaign promises, even those of the most basic improvements in living conditions. Last month, prices rose again, with high sectors such as education at all levels, from day care to postgraduate, food, such as the costs of basic food baskets and items such as rice, fruits, potatoes, milk and Onion and also in the transport area, with discharge in gasoline and public transport.

   Comrades of the International Communist Movement, we put to its consideration the thesis of Comrade Aureliano S., co -founder of the journal contradiction and of the Communist Workers Union (MLM). These thesis correspond to the comrade's vision on the world situation, the world proletarian revolution and the way that the new international must now acquire to respond to the demands of these times.
  </p>
<p>
   The comrade's position does not compromise the organization of the Union; However, at its maximum democratic event in the XV Assembly "Comrade Jaime Rangel", he decided to undertake his study to promote the discussion and take a position in this regard; That is why we advertise them so that the comrades of the different countries also pronounce.
  </p>
<p>
   As in advance it is known that the thesis will cause a stir, the comrade is willing to support them from the questions and questions that inevitably arise. Therefore we encourage organizations, parties and comrades, cadres and militants of the different countries, to participate in this debate that will surely contribute to raise the level of understanding of the current situation, the perspective of the world proletarian revolution and the tasks that it to it correspond to the revolutionary proletariat of all countries.
  </p>
<p>
   Our Blog International Debate will publish your questions, concerns, questions and positions.

   Thesis on the World Association of the Proletariat
  </h4>
<ol>
<li li="">
<li>
     This requires an international revolution of the proletariat, which understands the totality or the majority, at least, of land countries. The triumph of the socialist revolution in a single country is no longer possible. In other words, the current situation of humanity tends to a world revolution against capitalism and only socialism can save humanity. Since capitalism in its agony is the reaction throughout the line and has shown that it is willing to the wildest repression and to commit the greatest crimes in order to maintain the privileges of the bourgeoisie and its profits, at the expense of plundering the working class And nature, now, more than ever, rebellion is justified. Revolutionary violence is justified.
    </li>
<li li="">
<li>
      Such a situation requires rethinking the construction tactics of the international organization of the proletariat. An international type of new type is necessary: a world association of proletarians, based on the fraternal solidarity of all land workers. Its joint struggle is the only guarantee to raise consciousness and prepare the conditions for the final assault on the imperialist strength and fulfill its historical mission to end all forms of oppression and exploitation and bring humanity to a production of its material goods without plundering nature. And the main condition of such assault is the constitution of the Revolutionary Party of the proletariat.
     </li>
<li>
      The association must admit in its bosom all organizations and individuals, of all the trends of the labor movement, in the manner of a melting that through the fire of the fight acrisole the true proletarian movement. Only in this way can the alliances of the labor movement with other movements be established and with all those who are willing to fight against capitalism and prevent the destruction of civilization and life on earth.
     </li>
<li>
      The association must be governed by democratic centralism and have a single world management center and sectional organizations in each country or nation.
     </li>
<li>
      The communists, as part of the labor movement, must contribute with all energy to the construction of such association, without pretending to be the owners of it. Of course, Marxist communists Leninists Maoist must continue to strive to build MLM communist parties as part of the association and to achieve their unity worldwide and thus be able to contribute more force to the formation of the World Workers Association.
     </li>
<li>
      Proletarians of the world units.

   Forty years have passed since the proclamation of the commune of Paris. According to the established custom, the French proletariat honored with rallies and demonstrations the memory of the men of the revolution of March 18, 1871. At the end of May it will return to flow crowns of flowers to the tombs of the combined communards, victims of the terrible "May week", and before them he will swear again that he will fight tirelessly until the total triumph of his ideas, until he fulfilled the work they read.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c20091c369163f5e9835ac37af237d2e">
   Why the proletariat, not only French, but that of the whole world, honors the men of the commune of Paris as their predecessors? What is the inheritance of the commune?
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6cc6253556607add06128b374872bf03">
   The commune arose spontaneously, no one prepared it consciously and systemically. The unfortunate war with Germany, deprivations during the site, the unemployment between the proletariat and the ruin of the little bourgeoisie, the outrage of the masses against the upper classes and the authorities, which had demonstrated an absolute inability, the deaf effervescence in the working class, unhappy of his situation and anxious to a new social regime; The reactionary composition of the National Assembly, which made fear for the fate of the Republic, all and many other causes were combined to boost the population of Paris to the March 18 revolution, which unexpectedly put power in the hands of the National Guard, in the hands of the working class and the little bourgeoisie, who had joined her.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bdf50a030e7bb36d2d04e2d45cc7ec20">
   It was an unprecedented historical event. Until then, the power had been, as a rule, in the hands of the landowners and the capitalists, that is, of their proxies, which constituted the so -called government. After the revolution of March 18, when the government of Mr. Thiers fled from Paris with his troops, his police and his officials, the people owned the situation and the power passed to the proletariat. But in Modern Society, the proletariat, economicly overwhelmed by capital, cannot dominate politically if it does not break the chains that tied it to capital. Hence, the movement of the commune should inevitably acquire a socialist dye, that is, it should tend to overthrow the domain of the bourgeoisie, the domination of capital, to the destruction of the very basis of the contemporary social regime.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5d2459ca34ff880724b7864671bcea13">
   At first it was a very heterogeneous and confusing movement. The patriots adhered to him, hoping that the commune would resume the war against the Germans, leading it to a venturous outcome. They were also supported by the little tenders, in danger of ruin if the payment of the defeated debts of the rentals (postponement that the government denied them, but that the commune granted them) was not postponed). Finally, in the beginning they also sympathized with him with him the bourgeois Republicans, fearful that the National Assembly reactionary (the "rural", the wild landwives) restored the monarchy. But the fundamental role in this movement was naturally performed by the workers (especially the artisans of Paris), among which in the last years of the second empire an intense socialist propaganda, and that even many of them were International affiliates.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c8b54aa1281b65b134b34cbe64fc99cb">
   Only the workers remained faithful to the commune until the end. The Republican bourgeois and the little bourgeoisie soon departed from her very: some scared the revolutionary socialist character of the movement, because of their proletarian character; Others departed from her to see that she was condemned to an inevitable defeat. Only the French proletarians supported their government, without fear or fainting, only they fought and died for it, that is, for the emancipation of the working class, for a better future for the workers.
  </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e4ef250573290337b081b1d621cc1a2c" p="">
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6dd6b387c016138d57dfa6fd0c4a71bc">
    In order for a social revolution to succeed, it needs at least two conditions: a high development of the productive forces and a proletariat prepared for it. But in 1871 it was lacked both conditions. French capitalism was still poorly developed, and France was then, fundamentally, a country of little bourgeoisie (artisans, peasants, shopkeepers, etc.). On the other hand, there was no labor party, and the working class was not prepared or had a long training, and mostly even clearly understood what their ends were or how it could reach them. There was no serious political organization of the proletariat, or strong unions, or cooperative societies ...
   </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-addc628c107269766012a5364200f719">
    But what lacked the commune was, mainly time, the possibility of realizing the situation and undertaking the realization of its program. He had not had time to start the task when the government, entrenched in Versailles and supported throughout the bourgeoisie, began military operations against Paris. The commune had to think first of all about its own defense. And until the end, which came in the week of May 21 to 28, he could not think seriously in anything else.

     All these measures eloquently showed that the commune was a deadly threat to the old world, based on oppression and exploitation. That was the reason that the bourgeois society could not sleep peacefully while in the Paris City Council the Red Flag of the proletariat waved. And when the organized government force could finally dominate the poorly organized force of the revolution, the Bonapartist Generals, those generals beaten by the Germans and brave before their defeated compatriots, those Rénnenkampf and Meller-Zakomielski French, made a massacre As Paris had never seen. About 30,000 Parisians were killed by unbridled soldiers; Some 45,000 were arrested and many of them subsequently executed; Thousands were the banished or convicted to work forced. In total, Paris lost about 100,000 of their children, including the best workers of all trades.

     The bourgeoisie was happy. "Now the socialism has ended for a long time!", Said his boss, the bloodthirsty Dwarf Thiers, when he and his generals drowned in blood the uprising of the proletariat of Paris. But those bourgeois crows grazed in vain. After six years of having crushed the commune, when many of their fighters were still in prison or in exile, a new labor movement began in France. The new socialist generation, enriched with the experience of its predecessors, whose defeat had not discouraged it at all, picked up the flag that had fallen from the hands of the fighters of the commune and carried it forward with firmness and boldness, to the cry of “ Long live the social revolution, live the commune! ” And three or four years later, a new labor party and the agitation raised by it in the country forced the ruling classes to release the communards that the Government still kept imprisoned.

      The cause of the commune is the cause of the social revolution, it is the cause of the complete political and economic emancipation of the workers, it is the cause of the world proletariat. And in this sense it is immortal.

<p>
  Different ministerial actions and a campaign entitled “60 years of the 1964-2024 coup-without memory there is no future” were the activities planned by the Ministry of Human Rights for April 1 that were canceled by the Order of Luiz Inacio to perform critical acts to the military coup at the mark of six decades of the episode. The information was revealed by Folha de São Paulo.
 </p>
<p>
  The documents accessed by the monopolistic newspaper indicate that one of the actions was entitled “Called for an interministerial and intersectoral campaign”, and sought to articulate different sectors in an act of condemnation of the coup. Another act sought a series of “formal reparations”, as a public apology from the different ministries to those who suffered for the military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  They are unquestionably shy initiatives, but what stands out most in the picture is not the lack of voluptuousness of actions planned by the human rights portfolio, but as Luiz Inacio ordered the end of these purely institutional initiatives, which would directly affect the barracks. No reactionary military man would be forced to take part in the “public apology”, for example.
 </p>
<p>
  And if the government capitulates even in movements like these, what else can be expected? If the presidency does not want to gather ministers for a retraction on behalf of the Brazilian State, who can expect bodies such as the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (extinct in Bolsonaro's government), which investigates the crimes of the military regime and cast more light in Will torturers and murderers of the military regime be reopened by the current government?
 </p>
<p>
  Moreover, another central question is raised again: if the government feels so shy to formally condemn the coup 60 years ago, as it will fight
  <em>
   in fact
  </em>
  The coup today? According to some in the government, Luiz Inacio "discouraged" the military to celebrate the military coup, but the kind request did not work. In Rio, the Military Club has already marked an event to celebrate the date, which will have as a speaker a general known for the pro-64 positions and pro-intervention of the barracks in national political life.
 </p>
<p>
  Bring to the Bank of the Defendants some generals and other senior mandates burned by the proximity to the Bolsonarist Center, which is a cause for the government's boost in recent weeks, it is not the highest fight against coup, no matter how necessary. The fight against coup necessarily permeates the conception present in the reactionary armed forces since the founding of the Republic that they are the true moderating power
  <strong>
</strong>
  of the nation.
 </p>
<p>
  This conception is not exclusive to those who drive institutional rupture in 2022, precisely because it is a nuclear part of the Brazilian reactionary forces and being passed on generation after generation in training courses. Freire Gomes, for example, former army commander who allegedly opposed the break in 2022, signed the note that, besides showing support for camps in front of the barracks, argued that the Armed Forces were
  <a href="https://www.cms.eb.mil.br/index.php/noticias/as-instituicoes-e-ao-povo-brasileiro#:~:text=sempre%20presentes%20e%20moderadoras%20nos%20mais%20importantes%20momentos%20de%20nossa%20hist%C3%B3ria" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   “Always present and moderators in the most important moments of our history”
  </a>
  . Throughout the last year, and particularly at a January 2023 meeting with his subordinates, the current commander Tomás Paiva and then (in January) commander of the Southeast Military Command, also
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/luiz-inacio-deveria-se-preocupar-com-os-generais-legalistas/">
   It has already made it clear that it is not against the politicization of the Armed Forces reactionary and its intervention in national political life
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  This podium has already stated and will continue to say: forgetting the coup of 64 only matters to today's scammers.
 </p>
<p>
  Progressive and democratic activists across the country, among which are family members of the regime's victim, similarly state that it is impossible to deal with recent episodes of coup in the country without taking into account the 1964 coup and, besides it, “amystist ”To the generals of the period in the departure of the regime.

<p>
  Within Brazilian reactionary institutions, the struggle between the Armed Forces and the Federal Supreme Court has been fought since the past decade, particularly after the 2013-2014 popular surveys and Operation Lava-Jato. In the following years, in the face of the political crisis and institutional shaking, contradictions became more and more acute in the dispute for defining which form should assume the old Brazilian state to conduct the people's exploitation system.
 </p>
<p>
  Take as an example the former Army Commander Freire Gomes. Today called a "traitor" by pockets and treated as "saints" by reactionary analysts and by the federal government, some unsuspecting could think that his contribution to the country is appeasing the political shakes caused by the far right. Well, until recently this gentleman was discussing a scheme to arrest Alexandre de Moraes. The information is from Vera Rosa, from the state of São Paulo.
 </p>
<p>
  In August 2022, while still commander of the Army, Freire Gomes met with the other commanders and other generals at the closed doors to discuss the call by the newly sworn in president of the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) - Alexandre de Moraes - of an extraordinary meeting with the general commanders of the Military Police to discuss the security of the elections. Complaining that, by the Constitution, who commands the PMs and the auxiliary forces is the army and that it was not even consulted by Moraes, Freire Gomes, enraged, even discussed a proposal to request the Attorney General's Office the arrest of the Minister of STF. A close look concludes that the Constitution, after all, can serve the interventionist purposes of the Armed Forces and that, most likely, such a request would be fulfilled by the then Attorney General, Augusto Aras.
 </p>
<p>
  There are STF ministers, among them Gilmar Mendes, who advocate investigations over the next three months of officers who, knowing Bolsonaro's coup plan, did nothing. Others, such as André Mendonça, are still defending the thesis of the military, according to which the officers should not be moved, only in Jair Bolsonaro. Although the nation deserves to know everything that the military commanders have set up in the goal of punishing them for their crimes against the people, one cannot have an illusion with the
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/sobram-provas-para-prender-bolsonaro-faltam-meios-para-o-stf-acabar-com-chaga-do-golpismo/">
   Liberal right that heads the STF
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  This is also why the justice of the warning raised by this podium that one should not trust everything is confirmed in the monopolies of communication should not be confirmed. Especially when it comes to the Armed Forces that, after the end of the military regime, they led a broad amnesty process, a constituent assembly in which they imposed articles that give the intervention of the military (Article 142) and whose name of greatest prestige of the Last 30 years (General Eduardo Villas-Bôas) has admitted that the reactionary armed forces must be “silent protagonists for society to know that the crisis will not exceed certain limits”, launching the settings of “legitimacy, stability, legality”.

<p>
  Every female plenary was preceded by intense mobilization between peasants, meetings and mobilization committees. Throughout the activity, the spirit of combativity expressed the awakening of the revolutionary fury of peasant women.
 </p>
<p>
  The female plenary of peasant women was ended with the hymn of the fighters of the revolution and many words of the warriors of the South Forest of Pernambuco.

<p>
  On the morning of the 14th, residents of Jardim das Oliveiras II, in the north of Guarulhos, protested against an order of repossession in the neighborhood. The Military Police attacked the workers and detained a person. Residents point to the irregularity of the process, while the state has brought terror to the Guarulhense population.
 </p>
<p>
  Upon being notified of the repossession of repossession, residents closed the cast of the cast with tires very early and set them on fire. Police appeared and fired dispersion bombs against people there. Former Councilwoman Fernanda Curti was taken in custody accused of road obstruction and “depredation of public heritage”.
 </p>
<p>
  The movement reports that a man complains about land possession and formed a cooperative to systematize the charge for it. This region of Guarulhos is known for the occupations of unusable land, and there are families inhabiting the area since before the claim. Some have already been paying rent even to third parties and are now charged for the amount of possession of land without regular subdivision, under contracts worth up to R $ 400 thousand.
 </p>
<p>
  The movement by housing also manifested on February 27. First, the residents made a march that closed Tiradentes Avenue until reached the City Hall building. When the reactionary mayor Gustavo Costa (PSD) refused to receive them, they decided to lock the Hélio Smidt highway, which gives access to the airport
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  COLLEARY BETWEEN MAYOR AND MYGNATAS
 </h4>
<p>
  The neighborhood lacks urban infrastructure, since the city denies the right of families to houses and safeguards the right to deny the paving of the streets. Residents denounce collegiality between the rulers and the alleged owners of the real estate. The Santa Paulina Parish, frequented by people from all over the region, is also included in the threatened area of reintegration.

  It would not be the first case of benefit by the City Hall to the Allies. Gustavo Costa recently 24 more politicians, businessmen, and privileged employees were convicted at the São Paulo Court of Justice the loss of public office for administrative misconduct. The prosecution refers to the demolition in 2010 of Casarão Saraceni, allowed by the city, for the expansion of the parking lot of Internacional Shopping. To justify it, the mayor, in the name of his interests and his allies, issued the distance of the building, denying the historical meaning of this, as in the urbanization of the municipality and the constitutionalist uprising of 1932.

  Although the determination has come too late to avoid crime, the occasion demonstrates the arrangement that politicians have to defend the interests of the ruling classes. To those who toil day by day, maintaining and feeding the municipality and the country, there is only the promises, the crumbs, and the neglect. Moreover, crimes against the people are constantly repeated, proving not exceptions by rotten apples, but the rule of a rotten system.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The state violates workers and privileges the rich
 </h4>
<p>
  This was not the first time in the year the PM attacked with repressive violence workers in the Guarulhos region. The Mandela Free movement reported that in the last week of February, police officers were practicing abusive approaches and invading homes in the favelas are Rafael and the owl. A protest against the lack of energy ended with truculent intervention.

  marched the people's women's movement along with the union for teachers, shouting slogans as "proletarian feminism crushes the patriarchy". During the march, support was also expressed for the heroic national resistance in Palestine. Matches were distributed that encouraged women to join the movement. The people's women's movement held an appeal where they emphasized that it is class that separates us, not gender, and that it is the proletarian revolution that is on the agenda, not the so -called "gender ideology". Many businesses and banks had covered their windows with plywood, and the government palace and pavilion in the square were also surrounded by fences and other obstacles in an attempt to stop the protesters from holding a meeting at the end of the march. During the cry of slogans, the protesters removed the fences and took the pavilion to get their message out.

  A tribute was held by the people's women's movement, such as honoring revolutionary and communist women, and it was applauded and shouted: "Break the links, release the rage of women, as a powerful force for the revolution." The protesters went out into the streets and demanded justice for the women's killings, the rapes and the sexual oppression for which half of the working people are exposed. On banks and large stores it was written: "Up with the oppressed, down with the oppressors" and posters were set up against imperialism and for the Palestinian people's heroic struggle.

   March 18 - Day of Solidarity to Political Prisoners - Tribute to Communist and Revolutionary Prisoners
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  March 18 is the International Day of Solidarity to political prisoners. Founded by Comintern in 1920, Red Socorro in 1923 declared March 18, given the founding of the Paris Commune, such as the “International Day of Solidarity to Political Prisoners” and dedicated him to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners is expressed around the world.

    As the contradictions of the dominant system deepen and their stagnations multiply as their fear of the "burials" grows, the ruling classes do not hesitate to increasingly reveal their true character. At the same time, the increasingly profound and insoluble system crisis is leading the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting all kinds to centralize the sovereign state mechanism more strongly, both with their laws and their organizations

     The Indian reactionary state arrested more than ten thousand communists, revolutionaries and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to burg the popular war.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, although he has already fulfilled his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been trapped by Yankee imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed peoples from different parts of the world spent decades in jail.
    </p>
<p>
     The fear of the ruling classes of communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enmity they feel to them is so great that they pretense that the communists and revolutionaries who keep enclosed, in the open violation of their own laws, come out of prisons. The murder of President Gonzalo in 2021, head of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years in solitary confinement and whose death was caused because the necessary measures were not taken, it is very important to understand the extension of fear and hate that They feel the imperialists and the servants of the dominant system. Those responsible for the death of President Gonzalo, who even burned and destroyed his body.
    </p>
<p>
     Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons are trying to comply with the requirements of class struggle to the risk of their lives, to the limits of prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to resist all types of pressure, torture and lone confinement. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight all kinds of aggression against prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside the jail, we must support their struggle under the conditions of imprisonment as part of the class struggle outside.

<strong>
      Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!

<strong>
      Supporting communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle!

<strong>
      Let us make our resistance and struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners!

<p>
  While investigations show that a considerable part of the Armed Forces and high official, albeit minority, mobilized to consummate the military coup, agent Luiz Inacio reiterated his orientation: not promoting acts or condemnatory events at the 60th anniversary of the coup 64.
 </p>
<p>
  To prove the error of this policy of the shift government, it would be enough to quote how the reactionary sectors of the ruling classes received. Representing the military right, ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mourão had no doubt: "He is right, this is passed," he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Estadão, accustomed to criticizing Luiz Inácio, rushed to leave in his defense: “Lula acts correctly” when she refuses to talk about the 1964 coup in the passage of her 60 years, in line with “an imperative of governability in a context of Wounds waiting for healing ”and“ is also a way to honor the current military command, also artificial of pacification ”, said in the editorial“ The accommodation of Lula with the military ”(March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estadão who has already argued that the government reopens the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (CEMDP), what Luiz Inacio refuses to do, capitule choir with the cowardly complicity of this government.
 </p>
<p>
  Only reactionary ideologues - committed first and foremost to the continuity of the exploitation of the people and the nation - and the opportunists, whose castrated mentality by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of popular masses believe that appeasement will lead to the country's stabilization.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the result of the elections (2018), when removing Luiz Inacio from the match, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote of that candidate in the Supreme Court.
  </p>
<p>
   As we see: Long before Bolsonaro assumed - and independent of him - the latent wound of coup again manifested acutely, even because it was not properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with gorillas and transition with the amnesty military regime General and unrestricted, he led that there was no punishment, nor change in high military official, nor in the curricula of formation, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as “Democratic Revolution,” and when they remove from the forefront of managing the old state, resuming the belief of being the armed forces as a moderating power and spitting of the “democratic rule of law” - and therefore also spun from their restriction or Even suspension, as he blatantly tried to make Bolsonaro.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    When Luiz Inácio elects the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all the favorable conditions to be restored for the Military High Command to return to the offensive later. When the masses rise in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, gorillas, as a moderating power to believe, will again rise threatening the country with military intervention to save the nation from "disintegration." Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and fragile, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup climb.
   </p>
<p>
    The appeasement with the military summit only breastfeed the coup!
   </p>
<p>
    To genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, in addition to the popular masses in struggle, there is no other way other than to lift the 60th anniversary campaign of the ignominious 1964 coup and coup, either in the form of institutional rupture, or in the form of “moderating power”. Commitments to fascists and scammers - who would only lead us to coup and fascism are not acceptable.

  The Federal Supreme Court (STF) approved last night the award -winning denunciation of the head of the execution of Marielle Franco and Anderson Gomes, Ronnie Lessa. According to the information that was leaked to the press, Ronnie Lessa gave the name of those who hired him and the context of the meetings she had before and after the crime. Thus, the person responsible for triggering the gun trigger that murdered the former councilwoman delivered details that have been clarified six years. According to the Minister of Justice Lewandowski, the approval indicates that “we will soon have the solution” of the case.
 </p>
<p>
  Ronnie Lessa began to collaborate with the court in August 2023, shortly after learning that Élcio de Queiroz handed over her name as the crime executor. Lessa, who is in an isolated cell in the Campo Grande Penitentiary (MS), gave a two -hour testimony. In it, the former military police officer provided a series of evidence, circumstances and evidence not only of his involvement in the execution of the double murder, but mainly about those behind the commission of the deaths. Now what justice has in hand is the one who hired Ronnie Lessa to execute the former councilor, and with whom the executor gathered.
 </p>
<p>
  According to Ronnie Lessa, the principals are part of a powerful political group of RJ, with broad presence in various sectors of the state. One of the cited is Chiquinho Brazil. Federal Deputy for União Brasil, Chiquinho campaigned for Jair Bolsonaro in 2022. He is also the brother of Domingos Brazão, the Court of Auditors of RJ, and Pedro Brazão, state deputy.
 </p>
<p>
  Domingos Brazão, involved with militias since the early 2000s, is named as the intellectual mentor of the murders. Domingos tried to obstruct Marielle's murder investigation process in 2019 (before the case was federalized) and had previously been removed in 2017 for corruption involvement. Kássio Nunes Marques (Supreme Court Minister appointed by Jair Bolsonaro) determined the resumption of the counselor's activities, placing him in a more armored condition for investigations, re-featuring “privileged forum”.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  Ronnie Lessa's lawyers abandon the case after her client closes the agreement
 </h3>
<p>
  Ronnie Lessa's lawyers said they will no longer continue to defend the paramiltar. In a press release, they stated that the decision is motivated "by legal ideology": "Not acting to whistleblowers is a principle, pre-case issue, and has nothing to do with any interest in the solution or not of a particular crime."
 </p>
<p>
  Curious “Legal Ideology” This: Alright defending the professional killer Ronnie Lessa. No problem! As long as he doesn't denounce.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  Ronnie Lessa and Élcio de Queiroz: linked to the Bolsonaro family
 </h3>
<p>
  Both stand out for having a common biographical trait: Ronnie Lessa lived in the same condominium as Jair Bolsonaro, Barra da Tijuca. Lessa's daughter dated Bolsonaro's youngest son. Ronnie Lessa also stated, at the beginning of the investigations, that those who executed Marielle was Adriano da Nobrega, then head of the paramilitary group “Office of Crime”.
 </p>
<p>
  Already Élcio de Queiroz, who chose Lessa as “godfather of consideration of her son”, has also lived in the same condominium as Bolsonaro. Élcio de Queiroz is a former military police officer of RJ and also involved with “militia, bicheiros, traffickers and smugglers” according to investigations by the Civil and Military Police.
 </p>
<p>
  Before becoming a professional killer, Ronnie Lessa served in the army and was a military and civil police officer. The relationship between Queiroz and Lessa, who had already been known since before serving the PM, was strengthened after being expelled from the corporation for involvement with paramilitary groups.
 </p>
<p>
  This relationship between official repression forces, paramilitary groups, offenders and smugglers is not limited to the names mentioned here. Ronnie Lessa participated in A Scuderie Le Cocq (SLC), a well -known extermination group founded in 1965 in the RJ that gathered military police. The founders of SLC were linked to the government of the time. They were used to do a work of “elimination” of criminals, residents of street and transvestites.
 </p>
<p>
  Throughout the military regime, Scuderie - or the death squad, as it has also become known - also fulfilled the role of selective elimination of political militants. Other members of the “death squad” are loose and active.
 </p>
<p>
  A total of 17 military police were arrested on March 20 for providing services to Bicheiro Rogério de Andrade. This whole structure needs to be properly investigated and punished. Another example of a bicheiro that maintains spurious relationships is “Captain Guimarães”: the military man who was expelled for involvement with “smuggling” and today sends and clears in the animal game and carnival, brings together allegations of political militants from the time of the military regime that counted The Truth Commission that were tortured by Guimarães during an instructional course for military.
 </p>
<p>
  It must be clear what all these facts show us: There are many other figures that have made paintings of the Military Police or Army that make up the far right, paramilitary groups and agents of state repression.

  The fact that the Left Party is a social democratic force that shakes with various left -wing phrases, but is ultimately completely connected to this system, should actually be clear to everyone. However, there are always moments when this is particularly obvious. The Left Party Saxony-Anhalt recently with a reactionary CDU politician. One reason to take a closer look at the situation of the Left Party.
 </p>
<p>
  The CDU politician that deals with is Götz Ulrich. He is a district administrator in the Burgenland district. The corresponding situation was that the AfD wanted to make a demonstration that was originally supposed to pass his house. Even if the AfD ultimately agreed to lay the demonstration route, Ulrich sensed an attempted intimidation against it and pulled parallels during the Nazi era. Numerous other parties jumped up on this train and seemed to once again seemed to call the defense of bourgeois democracy in front of their AfD campaign in the AfD campaign.
 </p>
<p>
  The Left Party also jumped on this train and fully solidarized with Ulrich Götz. Paradox, because in her apparent fight against racism, this party was solidarity with a politician who represents racist rights. Responsible demands such as the faster deportations and the introduction of payment cards for refugees are by no means AfD claims, but things that are challenged by politicians like Götz Ulrich equally

   The party congress ultimately ended with a compromise. While there was a decided application in the decisions, which explits only solidarity with all violent anti-fascists, there was also an evaluation of the Antifa-Ost procedure at the urging of the party youth, which is not a whole and not half solidarity. Instead of actually clearly demanding freedom for the Antifa-Ost prisoners, this evaluation says: "We recognize the risk of generalization and delegitimation of anti-fascist resistance fights and solidarity with left-wing political prisoners." But if you mean “left -wing political prisoners”, there are apparently different views in that party.

    In the meantime, the Left Party is increasingly on the way to political insignificance. In addition to the factor of their internal contradictions, more and more people have become and realize how little one can believe this party and their fetching. Not at all. As is the case with all bourgeois parties.

  The Filipino people burning against the US-Marcos regime in the fascist attacks throughout the country, especially in the countryside. The rage of the peasant masses are extremely angry and hunger, fascism and gutter with the reactionary regime's response to their request.
 </p>
<p>
  In the desperate attempt to "end" the revolutionary armed resistance of the Filipino people, now the terrorist and fascist suppression of the US-Marcos regime and its armed gatherers throughout the country. Marcos and the AFP's mini-free declarations are in the "insurgency-free", especially provinces that are supplied and united in foreign companies, plantations and energy. In the US imperialism command, the AFP also hurried to "end" the armed struggle with the Filipino people to fully use the US military the AFP to the intensity of this year.
 </p>
<p>
  Recently, a subsub of war was ordered by Marcos and the armed forces of the Philippines (AFP). These todies are supposed to hear all of the NPA guerrilla fronts at the end of March, will break all NPA units at the end of June, and all the regional party committees will be the end of the year. You are collected thousands of military troops, the police and thousands of paramilitars are invited to the AFP, the Gideployer to get rid of the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of villages were Gurarison in Marcos' fascist gatherings. The ruling soldier controlled the life and livelihoods of men, placing their mouths, and took their rights and freedom. Checkpoints and food blacks, ban farming farms, armed withes, armed soldiers in village, housing and pretending to "surrender," houses, gainum-drinks, Scramble and scandal, gunfire is a gun somewhere - only a few of the rotten deeds that are mentally ill. Among the drought and dangers, fascist soldiers were pested by no other side of communities.
 </p>
<p>
  With strong weapons, drones and jetfighters, helicopters and howitzers, evening, the bombing of the terrorist soldiers of Marcos in the mountains of the wealth and dim on the waters of the wealth Silence and resulted in the depths of the people, especially children, pregnant and ancestors. It produces severe degradation of life, contrary to all principles and laws of civilized warfare.
 </p>
<p>
  Marcos is evil to push the fear of the people's breasts and overwhelm them as the land of large capitalist and conspiratory bourgeoisers and large landlords. But instead of bowing, they aroused more and more, and resisted, and the road to the armed revolution.
 </p>
<p>
  In guerrilla fronts nationwide, the units of the new People's Peasant (NPA) can continue to enjoy the peasantry. The military officials at the AFP and the reactionary state behind their exalted Todo-Gyera have already lasted for almost seven years, the masses continued to provide material and political support to red fighters. You are also constantly filing with the people's people's army, including students, workers and even professionals.
 </p>
<p>
  The people's desire to serve the armed struggle continues to burn. Among the fascist attacks of the US-Marcos' regime's armed regime, and its policies more intimidate them, more clearly to the mind and mood of the peasantry without their new People's Army They have been able to protect their lives and rights, and with their struggle for land and livelihood.
 </p>
<p>
  Behaved years, the NPA has been injured and withdrawal in different parts of the country because of the mistakes and weaknesses of conservatism and contentment of the former victory. Instead of daring the road to the steady expansion and refreshment of the armed struggle, the masses and bases of the guerrilla units, became passive and vulnerable to the enemy. In the guidance and inspiration of the Party, the NPA is determined to correct errors and advance the path of studying and burning fire in the people's war.
 </p>
<p>
  In the sense of correction movement, the NPA must resist the armed struggle in all parts of the country. Consistent Mass Wide Gervae, Use All Firearms and Rocks, Spears and Tours, Debabba and Fire - And Launching The Tactical Offensive and Divided Part . The fascist troops of the enemy's fascist troops and all of them are as a means of achieving justice and inspire people's resistance. Only through the wide armed resistance will be strengthened, the NPA can improve and advance.
 </p>
<p>
  Ever since established, five and a half years ago, the NPA served as a true army of people who advanced the revolutionary desire of the Filipino people for national democracy. In its future anniversary on March 29, we will respond to victories achieved over 55 years, honor all martyrs and heroes, and repeat the determination for the sanctified warship, unless sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice and sacrifice. Adversity is needed, in order to achieve victory.

<p>
  The three major bourgeoisie-compradors announced their "integration" for the operation of the Ilijan LNG terminal, the first "integrated lng import facility" built by the Atlantic Gulf &amp; Amp; Pacific Company (AG &amp; amp; P) at the coast of Barangay Ilijan, Batangas City. Meralco Powergen, Aboitiz Power and San Miguel Global Power (SMGP) came together to buy such a facility for $ 3.3 billion (₱ 184 billion).
 </p>
<p>
  The Ilijan LNG terminal covers nine hectares of terrain and up to 700 meters water from the coast for "floating storage" of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas). Except for the harbor and storage, it will also serve as a "regasification" facility. Such a natural gas facility will supply to the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) energy-owned energy-owned energy plant.
 </p>
<p>
  This facility and plants include 12 "terminals" and 35 new energy plants plan to build imported lng and diesel. Seven of the terminals and eight of the new plants are set to be built on the coast of Batangas, in front of the Verde Island Passage (VIP). Others are planned to build in Leyte, Navotas City and Zamboanga. One of the plants, planned to be built on the coast of the Tañon Strait in San Carlos, Negros Occidental, was temporarily withdrawn by the protests of residents, church people and environmental groups. Many of the LNG projects are being pushed by SMC, including multinational Japanese, American and British institutions.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, six LNG plants are operational in the country, and five of them are on the coast of Batangas.
 </p>
<h2>
  The US surplus dump
 </h2>
<p>
  The Philippines has opened the import of LNG from 2021 in the face of reportingly approaching a natural gas reserve in the Malampaya gas fields in 2027. The US used it to push the country to import the LNG.
 </p>
<p>
  The US has been the leading producer of LNG worldwide since 2011. It has passed Russia, Australia and Qatar and became the number one exporter for the first time in December 2023. This is the result of the US seizure of LNG sales in Western Europe (Germany, France, UK, and others) who had previously flowed into pipes from Russia. Aside from the US imposing its violation of LNG's purchase of Russia from the outbreak of war in Ukraine, it has even exploded the Nordstream pipeline so as not to smuggle LNG. The terminals had to be built to store LNG from the US which was carried to Western Europe aboard large ships.
 </p>
<p>
  Ukraine's direct results in Ukraine's proxy warfare of LNG prices for $ 40 per million British thermal Unit (MMBTU) in 2022. However, due to LNG's over -production, prices have been dropped down to the global market for $ 9.80 per MMBTU in 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  The US is now working to open new markets and monopolize the former Asian markets to become a dump of LNG and keep its demand and price high. American companies such as ExxonMobil, Novatek and Chevron are most attached to import LNG.
 </p>
<p>
  Although LNG prices have dropped in the global market, it is only temporary and does not mean that it will lower electricity charges in the Philippines. In 2023, the imported LNG was $ 1- $ 3/MMBTU higher than local natural gas. In accordance with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the price of energy produced from imported lng. It is higher than the ₱ 7.38/kWh energy price from the same imported coal and diesel in 2023, and ₱ 4.4/kWh using local solar power.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite a certain higher charges, the Department of Energy has yet to require the acquisition of all power distributors from plants processing imported LNG. In accordance with the "energy map" of the Marcos regime, the Philippines will raise the use of imported LNG and "renewable" energy from 29% (of which 13%) to 35% by 2030 and 50% of 2050.
 </p>
<h2>
  Threat to VIP and fishermen's livelihood
 </h2>
<p>
  LNG is laid to be a "transition fuel" because it is cleaner compared to coal and diesel. However, it still creates greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In fact, studies appear to be more harmful to environmental its methane, as it has 80-100 times longer to lock the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide.
 </p>
<p>
  The pandemya (2021) began and the construction of the Ilijan lng terminal ended in 2023. It was built by AG &amp; amp; P, a United Arab Emirates -based company, Osaka Gas and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. In February, the American Nebula Energy company bought the AG &amp; AMP; P division dedicated to LNG.
 </p>
<p>
  The Ilijan LNG terminal is the Batangas Combine Cycle Power Plant currently being built by SMGP in Sta. Rita, Batangas. Although a separate project, the two facilities will join and face both parts of the VIP.
 </p>
<p>
  According to a study of the natural group, the two facilities, and the other like, are in the VIP ecosystem that scientists regard as the "richest habitat marine" in the world. In construction alone, sediment and sand have affected the scope of the facility. Construction has disturbed the cycle and inhabited by fish and other sailors life not only in its immediate range, but throughout the VIP. This has resulted in further decline in the quality of coral reefs and the fall of the late fishermen.
 </p>
<p>
  Apart from the damage to the ocean, the agricultural lands are also facing the case of illegal use of agricultural lands in the villages of Ilijan and De la Paz. It also has cases illegal cutting coconut trees in the area. In fact, the Department of Agriculture issued a "cease and desist order" against the company last year due to its lack of land use permit. All of these are shrugged by AG &amp; amp; P and Japan's banks.
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of fishermen in Batangas have long been affected by the operations of First Gen and SMC energy plants. Before the new plants and facilities began to be built, more than half had been deducted from the last fish (pounding and gallons) since 2019. They were even more trapped when fishing on coasts near the construction was banned.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, residents are worried about the possible leakage of the ocean, the VIP is especially vulnerable to strong and severe storms. The VIP from the damage caused by the oil leak from the SMC ship, the MT Princess Empress, last year.
 </p>
<p>
  The air and water in Batangas are increasingly polluted with the coast of the polluted energy plants. The sailor life is also especially disturbed because the ships that will deliver imported lng will be thick.
 </p>
<p>
  Many communities on the coast will lose their livelihood and even living. Among the two million Filipinos are directly in the VIP ocean wealth.

  The total amount of damage to the agricultural sector has reached ₱ 78.45 million due to drought in Negros Occidental and part of Western Visayas, the region of El Niño today. Eleven (three cities and eight towns) of its 32 municipalities are most affected by the drought. Thousands of families are now suffering from the hunger and poverty of drinking water.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of the negligence of the local government and the US-Marcos regime, the uninterrupted militarization, the peasant masses were no longer able to conquer but come together to collectively deal with the drought.
 </p>
<h2>
  Government charges
 </h2>
<p>
  The farmers' organization plans to promote the mass campaign in Negros Occidental to address El Niño. They have begun consultations, meetings and study campaigns at the Barangay Level, and they target the people to the People's and District Level. They prepare a petition containing their call to the government for adequate aids, food and subsidies in their production.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasant masses in the province are now facing the destruction of their crops. Only 41,140 hectares of 94,297 hectares of irrigation targets are irrigation, which is now affected by drought. One farmer's story said, “We haven't done 3rd rice cropping anymore because we only rely on the rain for irrigation.” S
 </p>
<p>
  As a result, others are just planning to plant corn to keep up with their food. However, they still couldn't get started until there was no rain for irrigation. Others, planting vegetables and are now consuming water in remote wells to sprinkle. "The source has run out, even small rivers are gone," said another.
 </p>
<p>
  Nationwide, only 67% of the government's target has been implemented that irrigation has implemented in recent years. Many canals are no longer profitable, the gear is different and it has been damaged. Irrigation for irrigation from dams is also reduced as it is provided to industry and electrical services.
 </p>
<p>
  Even their pets are affected as well. There is no more buffalo, cow, goat, and other pet because the weeds are dry and they have nothing to eat. There were animals when they died from the heat.
 </p>
<p>
  Not only livelihood, but even the health of the residents is affected by El Niño. Excessive heat experienced has resulted in epidemics such as cough, fever, colds and other diseases. Some stroke cases have also been recorded in some areas, increasing blood pressure, and easy fatigue.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of this, they were deeply insulted by the low ₱ 2,500 that the local government would distribute to a three -hectare field. According to them, ₱ 15 million funds for pumps and irrigation pumps and equipment are also released.
 </p>
<p>
  They say, if they are not provided with significant help, they are willing to act together for dialogue and confrontation with local agencies.
 </p>
<h2>
  Characters
 </h2>
<p>
  To keep up with the production, the farmers raised the Dagyaw-Aim, the traditional form of agricultural cooperation in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  In the southern part of Negros Occidental, a communal garden is set to plant a land on the land that has been successful in a campaign. They agreed to be planted in the ground. “This is an initial aspect of cooperation… we follow the framework of“ work points, ”sharing the peasant participant. Every night, they agreed that the group of women would sprinkle with Maisa.
 </p>
<p>
  The unity and work of alliance with the middle forces in the community also resulted. According to them, the hoses they received were a great help. This is what they use to sprinkle especially and the source of water is far away.
 </p>
<p>
  "Our help is more developmental especially during the El Niño period ... especially and the work on camps is finalized," a farmer said. It will also help, he said, with the food source of drought. At this time, a farmer even proved, "There is no hope but our cooperation."

  Filipino women have touched the worst impact of neoliberal policies imposed by US imperialism and puppet states for the past four decades. Due to the policies of liberalization, deregulation and privatization, they are further pushed into the society, where they are forced to adapt to informal, unsafe and enslaved wages.
 </p>
<p>
  Most of the women are contained in the most exploited and oppressive sectors of society - workers, peasants and indigenous people, poor in the countryside and urban. In the last decade, more than half of them, ages 15 and older, have not been counted in the labor force because of the nature of the work they do. Among them are millions of housewives who work on farm jobs and receive "sideline" jobs while carrying heavy homework and caring for children. In 2022, women counting to the labor force, unemployed and lacking or unemployed.
 </p>
<p>
  Seven out of every ten women considered work are in the service sector. Their jobs here are “low-skilled” or need low skills and irregularity. This is despite the relatively highly reached level of women's education.
 </p>
<p>
  In the manufacturing sector, 90% of women were “irregular” and very small (2.7%) were contained in the unions. Many women are found in the factories of large foreign capitalists within the export processing zones, where they are part of the international assembly line (the imperialist global value chain calls). Foreigners are said to be "prefers" to women because of their self-esteem, skill in detailing work such as the assembly of semiconductors or sewing, and overtime sewing. In fact, these qualities are not natural to women, but due to the desperation of the constant employment crisis, which is exploited by capitalists and labor agencies.
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore, they are generally cheaper to pay, compared to men. In the clothing industry, for example, their wage level is less than 17% -25%.
 </p>
<p>
  Literal coins are being paid by women's manufacturing companies in poor communities that they are contracting to wholesale to perform certain parts of the assembly work. They are what the International Labor Organization calls industrial workers "home-based." Some of their jobs include small sewing, embroidery, small household equipment, food manufacturing, handicrafts and tourist decorations and more.
 </p>
<p>
  In freelance jobs, the wages of the digital work, compared to men are less than 18.4%. This is because of the "traditional perspective" that women are more appropriate for the type of "less complicated" jobs such as encoding, compared to "more complex" and with higher extra-essential jobs such as digital design allegedly ' Y “more appropriate” to men.
 </p>
<p>
  In agriculture, the wages of women's farm women receive less than 8% -15%, compared to men's wages. ) ”They play in production.
 </p>
<p>
  In order for them to survive their families, many women leave their children, leaving the country to work as helpers, nanny and other jobs that take them to great exploitation, oppression, violence, and in some cases, their death. In 2022, 1.10 million women (60.2%) were migrated, compared to 726,000 men (39.8%). Nonetheless, the annual abereyds were renewed by women's migrant workers (₱ 61,000) compared to men (₱ 126,000).
 </p>
<p>
  In the countryside, farmers women have sold the widespread landlessness. Very small number (6.3%) has a solo or land-owned amount of land. They carry the problem of high prices of farm inputs, low yield prices and losses during disasters. Big majority is in debt to the usurers and microfinance institutions, not only for production, but to the daily needs of their families.

<p>
  The great contribution of women to the promotion of the liberating movement and the revolutionary struggle in the Philippines cannot be overcome. From the time of the Spanish colonialist, American and Japan's occupation, under the fascist Marcos dictatorship, and to this day, they have not left the purple flag to promote the care of women and the motherland. They continue to resort to the heavy sacrifices and reassure the revolutionary duties.
 </p>
<p>
  The modern generation of revolutionary women imitates and inspires the example of Gabriela Silang, who led the liberating movement of Ilocos against Spain in 1763; by Coronacion Chiva (Commander Waling-Waling), who led the anti-Japan guerrilla to Panay and continued against the Marcos dictatorship; by Maria Lorena Barros, founder of the nationalist movement of new women; by Wilma Tiamzon, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Philippines; by Helenita Parladis, Secretary of the Party Committee in Eastern Visayas; of Beverly Sinunta's mother, Secretary of the Subregion in North Central Mindanao, and Chenchen Banawan; EMARIE PASTIDIO APISSIAL OF HIS PLATUN IN THE BHB-NEGROS and many other women martyred in the field of war. Hundreds of women warriors have their invaluable contribution to the promotion of people's war.
 </p>
<h2>
  Young women
 </h2>
<p>
  These women include Ka Lira, a 26-year-old Red Fighter of the New People's Army (NPA) in one of the guerrillas of Southern Tagalog. “I am now fulfilling a political and sometimes political instructor,” he shares. She has been in NPA for six years.
 </p>
<p>
  "Every day, I realize that there is more to learn, and to be cut off," Ka Lira said. As a woman and from the birty class, she strives to break the forced image of the woman who is weak and limited.
 </p>
<p>
  "There are women's military officers, Isnayper and cumaders, and lead the battles," he said. Often, the new men are shocked when they see them. Their presence in the army is a battle of the macho-feudal thought. “When women see us from the village, they greet us with wonder. Especially the moms, they really ask why I chose to leave a comfortable life. ”
 </p>
<p>
  "I told them, this life is not easy, but I accept the sacrifice because I know where it is," he said. "I just show them that there is nothing to worry about."
 </p>
<h2>
  Courage in dealing with the enemy
 </h2>
<p>
  Ka Rema, a red warrior of the NPA-North Central Mindanao, did not stand out, even when he was in the enemy's hands. Just thirteen days since the surgery of the Sessary to give birth, Ka Rema picked up the forest to escape the enemy and return to the NPA unit he belonged to. Ka Rema is a key to a BHB unit unit.
 </p>
<p>
  Ka Rema was a treason arrested by the military while in the hospital after giving birth. He was subjected to severe interrogation and forced to claim a counter-revolutionary "mission."
 </p>
<p>
  At that time, he carefully answered the questions of the military official and made sure that nothing new and magical data were given to them. He believed them and gave him the duty to subdue his red warrior.
 </p>
<p>
  At one point, Ka Rema never thought to betray the companions, the masses and the revolution. He repeatedly thought about how to escape the fascist hands. When the opportunity came to flee, he grabbed it. Before leaving, she hugged the 9-year-old son and her baby. "Maybe, they'll understand it in the future too," Ka Rema thought.
 </p>
<p>
  That day, Ka Rema arrived at the People's Army camp. He thanked the comrades and the masses who helped his escape. "Thank you and I've been back to my real home!" He passionately greet the comrades.

<p>
  The Filipino people's feelings against the US-Marcos regime are burning in all fascist involvement throughout the country, especially in the countryside. The peasant masses were full of wrath in the midst of their poverty and hunger, fascism and land seizure of the reactionary regime to their grievances.
 </p>
<p>
  In a desperate attempt to "end" the revolutionary armed resistance of the Filipino people, the terrorist and fascist devastation of the US-Marcos regime and its armed tentacles nationwide are now endless. Expect Marcos and the AFP's false declarations to the "insurgency-free" of various provinces, especially in the provinces that are destined to enter and adopt foreign companies in mining, plantation and plantation and energy. At the mandate of US imperialism, the AFP was also in a hurry to "end" the armed struggle of the Filipino people so that the US military could fully use the AFP in its war in China which is likely to be the late year.
 </p>
<p>
  A whole war was recently ordered by Marcos and the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). This is the purpose of this alliance with the dismantling of all the NPA guerrillas at the end of March, destroy all NPA balcony units at the end of June, and consume all regional party committees before the end of the year. A thousand military troops, co-workers' police troops and the ten thousand paramilitary armed by the AFP, were sent to roast in the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of villages are being charged by Marcos' fascists. The ruling soldier controls the lives and livelihoods of the people, shuts their mouths, and tramples their rights and freedoms. Decorations and Food Blocks, Prohibition Farmers or Climbing Barangay Armed Soldiers, Home-Homes and Forcing To "Surrender," bullying girls or even married people, drinking, beating, beating And blowing up, firing a gun everywhere-just a few of the rotten ones that make the people think. In the midst of drought and disasters, fascist soldiers are pests that have no other but harmful to their communities.
 </p>
<p>
  Using strong weapons, drones and jetfighter, helicopters and Howitzers, the bombing of Marcos's terrorist soldiers in the mountains and fields that damages the wealth of the jungle and poisoned the water, break It brings deep anxiety to the people, especially children, pregnant and older. It has been a great destination for life, contrary to all principles and laws in civilized warfare.
 </p>
<p>
  Marcos aims to aim for fear on the people's chest and to destroy them as they are being robbed by large alien capitalists and accomplice comprador bourgeoisie and big landlords. But instead of falling into the ground, they were even more aware of standing and fighting, and wasting the path of the armed revolution.
 </p>
<p>
  In the guerrillas across the country, the units of the New People's Army (NPA) are continuing to enjoy the deep and broad support of the peasant masses. The AFP military officials and the reactionary state are furious that despite their intensity-war-aged for almost seven years, the peasant masses have continued to provide political and material support to the Red fighters. Young peasants, as well as young students, workers and professionals, also continue to join the People's Army.
 </p>
<p>
  The people's desire to advance the armed struggle continues to fire. In the midst of the fascist involvement of the armed tentacles of the US-Marcos regime, and its burdens of policies further hurting them, the peasant's mind and awareness of the masses are more aware that they do not have anything if they do not have a new people's army in defense in their lives and rights, and with them in the struggle for land and livelihood.
 </p>
<p>
  In recent years, the NPA has suffered damage and withdrawal from various parts of the country due to errors and weaknesses of conservatism and unity in its previous success. Instead of daring to undermine the path of continuous expansion and stimulation of the armed struggle, the scope and mass of the guerrilla units of guerrilla units, became passive and vulnerable to the siege of the enemy. In the Party's guide and inspiration, the NPA is determined to correct the mistakes and advance the path of strengthening and blaming the fire of the people's war.
 </p>
<p>
  In the spirit of the correction movement, the NPA must stimulate the armed struggle in all parts of the country. Participation is a broad mass movement in guerrilla warfare, use all weapons - shooting and rock, spear and spit, spit and explosion - and launch large or small tactical offensives that can succeed against the vulnerable and isolated parts of the enemy. Enemies the fascist troops of the enemy and all its tentacles as a way of achieving the people of justice and to inspire their resistance. Only through extensive armed resistance can the NPA can be strengthened and advanced.
 </p>
<p>
  Since the establishment, five and a half decades ago, the NPA has served as the true town army that promotes the revolutionary intent of the Filipino people for national democracy. In its upcoming anniversary on March 29, we will celebrate the achievements that have been achieved over the last 55 years, pay homage to all martyrs and heroes, and re-determine the determination to advance the long-term people's war, any sacrifice and pain is needed , to achieve success in the future.

  Israeli Military, IDF, continues their brutal folk killing against the Palestinian people. It is estimated that more than 31,600 people have been murdered by Israel's grenades, bombs, missiles and shots. At the same time, their blockade of Gaza has prevented food and other relief from emerging, which has now brought the majority of people in Gaza

  Despite the carnage, the war ruins Israel, which is 100% dependent on the support of the imperialists, which clearly reveals the true character and interests of Denmark and other imperialists in West Asia, despite Mette Frederiksen and other government leaders' hypocritical crocodilles of Gaza's civilian population, and the modest symbolic relief they sending to Gaza.

  IDF right now from one area to another and might establish
  <em>
   control
  </em>
  As long as they have troops in an area. But as soon as they have left a previously controlled area, the people even restore their armed forces and resume the fight. In this way, IDF goes from defeat to defeat and struggles a wear and tear they will never be able to win. The only thing they are able to murder the masses in Gaza and try to starve them, but it will ultimately only push even more into the ranks of the freedom fighters as the choice between

  or

  being painted up black on white. The defeat of Israel and the viability of the freedom fighters is ultimately proof that Hamas, p.f.l.p. And other freedom fighters have the support of the masses and their battalions are made up of the people who fight and resist. Therefore, each bomb is Israel throwing the backlash and their tanks will only turn into steel chests for IDF pigs.

<strong>
   Bhadradri Koshygudem District, March ౨౧, ౨౦౨౪:
  </strong>
  The CPI (Maoist) Party Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) has expressed its readiness for peace talks with the Chhattisgarh government.
 </p>
<p>
  Committee Spokesperson, Comrade Vikalp, said in a statement released to the media today that the Maoists were always ready for peace talks for the welfare of the suppressed sections and to establish peace. Comrade Vikalp made it clear that if the government creates an amicable environment then the Maoists would come forward for peace talks. Comrade Vikalp stated that Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma was issuing statements on the government’s keenness in holding peace talks with Maoists, but he could not come clear on the DKSZC’s concerns and the measures conducive for peace talks. Comrade Vikalp wanted the government to stop staging fake encounters, militarization of tribal hamlets, to confine armed forces to barracks for six months and to stop establishing new police camps in the villages for the talks to happen.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Vikalp asked intellectuals, journalists, community, labor, women and people’s organizations and other concerned sections to put pressure on Chhattisgarh government to create a harmonious situation for the peace talks. If the government fails to do so, the public should raise their voice against its Operation Kagaar-Surya Shakti and other anti-people policies on the part of the state government.

     The 
  political elections are framed today as a mere affirmation of 
 internal force relationships to groups that act in a system 
 paralyzed. The purpose is no longer that of a contrast between 
 different visions and models of companies, but only that of testimony 
 of one's existence. The world moves on particular interests a 
 to which you submit yourself to be there.

  left organizations, meaning the small formations with these 
  socialists and communists present in Italy today, which could 
 constitute the push for a relaunch of politics as a tool of 
 change, continue to work in the logic of the elections and the 
 majority, to whom they say they oppose, but in which they punctually fall 
 at each electoral round, not understanding that they will not be able to 
 emerge until they will put themselves as an alternative and independent force 
 compared to the general political framework.

<p>
  The edition of Sunday seventeen March of the maximum cloaca of the pseudo Italian journalism of Accattto, the newspaper, contains an article where - as it has always been the costume of this lair of ignorant Buzzurri who demand journalists only because they are in possession of the card of the Order - deliberately confusion between two terms only apparently synonymous.
 </p>
<p>
  In the firm to seek a reason to paint the enemies of the "left", in this case the young people who attend Italian universities, such as serial haters unable to dialogue with those who think differently by themselves, try their hand at playing to equalize the Anti -Semitism with antixionism, even giving voice to this Alessandra Veronese, professor of medieval history at the University of Pisa.
 </p>
<p>
  Costei says: «The conflict has created an atmosphere of hatred towards Jewish and Israeli students. Hostile phrases, appreciation ostentatious for the massacre of 7 October. Many begin to be afraid, afraid to go around with the Kippah or the star of David, and someone advises them to disagree, for safety reasons, their identity. Hunt for the Zionist? Yes, something like this can be said. "
 </p>
<p>
  Apart from the fact that the so -called conflict between the Zionist entity and the Palestinian resistance is not a war at all, but a real genocide, affects the fact that a person who should be of culture confuses anti -Vionism with anti -Semitism ; Nobody, at least on the left, denies the right to exist to the descendants of SEM as professors the Jewish faith: it is Zionism that is executed, as a racist movement that would demand that Palestine was exclusively in its hands, chasing all those who think otherwise.

     TO 
  February, on the order of the Egyptian Armed Forces, an area of 16 
 Square kilometers along the border with Gaza has been flattened. In progress 
  also the construction of a concrete barrier. Cairo denies, but the 
 fear is that the country prepares the arrival of hundreds of thousands of 
 displaced Palestinians.

     From the concrete cages along the wall that separates Gaza from Egypt two 
 Egyptian soldiers sign that they do not take photos of work means. To the 
  Rafah pass, next to the entrance for humanitarian trucks, there is one 
 scraper. Other means are glimpsed in the nearby fields.

     As soon as 
  One kilometer south of the pass, in early February an entire disappeared 
  Agricultural area: an imperfect rectangle, four kilometers for 
 four, for a total of 16 square km, at the border. It is as if the 
 cut in two: one piece runs along the extreme south of Gaza, another 
 piece along the Israeli territory.

<strong>
   On the night of June 25, 2022, two people were killed and at least 21 injured when Zaniar Matapour opened fire at C. J. Hambros Square, in the center of Oslo. The PST and the E-service have subsequently been accused of facilitating the attack.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Matapour refuses to explain, but the charges are that the attack was targeted against nightclubs associated with LGBT people and the Pride parade, who would take place the day after the attack. Matapour is charged with "serious terrorist acts" with a penalty of 30 years.
 </p>
<p>
  Far more could have been killed, if it was not for civilian individuals to throw themselves over Matapour during the cessation of the shooting, prevented him from recharging the weapon, tore it from him and beat him and kept him down. The incident is well documented by a variety of surveillance videos from several angles. Several of these heroes have subsequently struggled mentally, but say they are dissatisfied with the lack of support from the health care system. Among these is the fisherman Mats Riskild Aasberg, one of those who threw himself over the shooter to tear the weapon from him.
 </p>
<p>
  Among the injured in the attack were Samir Alnahhar, Tobarnsfar and Palestinians from Gaza. He was shot in his head and tells VG that he has lost the security he had, that life has changed, that vision and hearing have been reduced and that he must go on crutches, and that he has been on sick leave since.
 </p>
<p>
  As a result of the attack, the police asked the Oslo Pride to cancel their event on June 25, which several have criticized strongly in retrospect, as an intervention in the freedom of assembly. Oslo Pride has protested the police, and also against the PST and the military intelligence service, which was warned in advance of the attack. However, thousands of people defied the police's "recommendation" and went on demonstration trains against the attack and in solidarity with everyone who felt affected.
 </p>
<p>
  It was quickly stated after the attack that Matapour and his acquaintances had been in contact with a secret agent for the e-service, who claimed to be an IS member. This agent encouraged to carry out the attack, and in various ways provided moral support to these - under the pretext for "information gathering". Furthermore, PST must have had a food therapy under supervision. In short, the Intelligence Service and the Surveillance Police of the bourgeois state this attack happened, which has aroused a lot of resentment from those affected and from organizations such as the Oslo Pride and the Association Fri.

<p>
     As it always has been and shall always be so long as the fascist 
occupation force calling itself Israel, its band of degenerate war 
criminals and rapists attempting to pass themselves off as a “defense 
force” and the equally vile settlers which illiterates and idiots 
believe to be “civilians” continue to exist in any capacity, the entire 
Arab nation and Palestine in particular face the worst genocide in 
living memory and an existential threat. Since Hamas launched its 
offensive to reclaim Arab land in response to the illegal and severe 
violations against their people Israel routinely commits on October 7th,
 the zionist filth have committed the most disgusting war crimes 
possible in plain view.
    </p>
<p>
     This includes instances of occupation forces making videos on social
 media making light of the fact that Arabs will starve or die of 
dehydration on account of their crimes, posting about sending the filth 
of their bloodlines gifts stolen from the homes of civilians they 
displaced, dedicating the destruction of whole towns to their spouses 
and in the case of a particular French zionist abomination, posing on 
social media with the undergarments of women whose homes him and his 
pack of unhinged, inbred war criminals plundered.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     These are just the instances of the occupation forces going above 
and beyond to break the spirit of the Arab people and reveling in their 
criminality. It does not come close to the additional, far more severe 
war crimes “Israel” has committed such as the deployment of the 
internationally banned white phosphorus, their informing civilians in 
the Northern Gaza Strip to evacuate the North before promptly bombing 
the South, the Flour Massacre where they ran down hundreds of civilians 
with tanks as they were fleeing and this is only what is most egregious 
and recent. The amount of crimes this settler colony has committed and 
continues to commit in this war alone defies comprehension.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     That Hamas has repeatedly offered peace terms, the UN, itself 
controlled by the imperialist yankee filth, has passed resolutions 
calling for a ceasefire and the general public, even among the 
profiteers of imperialism in the west have held demonstrations for 
Palestine and still “Israel” continues its course proves what anyone 
with any sense has known since their awareness of Israel’s existence. 
These are not men of reason and for Israel, this is not a war. It is a 
wholesale genocide with the only goal being the theft of Arab land, the 
resources in it and the eradication of the native population.
    </p>
<p>
     Since the last time we spoke about the situation, at the dawn of the
 war between Hamas and the zionist entity, we have seen a situation that
 would be astonishing for those who do not understand the terroristic 
character of the IDF.
    </p>
<p>
     Documents shared on Wikileaks and Times of Israel have revealed what
 should be common knowledge at this point: the occupiers’ plan is 
essentially to destroy Gaza and deport the population, considered too 
rebellious, to most probably, Egypt. The goal is no longer (if you 
believe it was ever the intention!) to destroy Hamas, but to destroy 
Gaza.
    </p>
<p>
     We remember when the Israeli government, after explaining to the 
Gazan populations that to escape Israeli bombings and attacks, they 
needed to migrate to the South, and that now that the North is finished,
 the South with Rafah is suffering all the fire from the imperialist 
forces.
    </p>
<p>
     Gaza is experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis: nearly 
90,000 injured and dead, 1.9 million people currently displaced. Hunger,
 bombings, death, rubble are the daily lives of nearly 2.5 million 
people. As even the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, from a cosmopolitan organization that itself supported 
(even created!) Israel, stated the 30th of January 2024:
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Life for civilians in Gaza is a real ordeal. Thousands of people are
 constantly on the move, having to leave places they were told were safe
 and living in constant fear. People make tents out of plastic bags and 
pieces of wood. They live on only one meal a day, if they are lucky. An 
image remains etched in my mind: I saw more than a hundred children 
running towards a cart bringing food. We see children everywhere, 
carrying water in cans, sometimes as young as 4 years old, chopping wood
 to make a fire. Children have not been going to school for months: 
schools and universities have been destroyed, destroying all hope for 
the future. Clinics and hospitals have been attacked, very few of them 
are still functioning, whether to provide trauma care or to help a woman
 give birth.”
     </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
     One of Israel’s most recent crimes, as of the time this is being 
written, is the Flour Massacre, during which several hundred 
Palestinians simply waiting for food were crushed and fired upon by 
Israeli tanks. Israel is in its very essence, exterminationist and seeks
 to end the existence of the Arab Nation. We must mention that the 
situation in the West Bank has gotten even worse since the beginning of 
the war. Israel is limiting far more to the Palestinians displaced in 
the West Bank, blocking access to main roads from villages, revoking all
 permits to enter Israel for work and creating dozens of checkpoints. In
 short, even the Arabs who wanted to be assimilated inside of the jewish
 welfare state are oppressed!
    </p>
<p>
     The two foreign ministers of France and Germany requested an 
international investigation to determine responsibility for the 
massacre…While the Israelis themselves admitted their responsibility, 
and simply explained that these shots were in reaction to Arabs 
approaching a military post (we must note that the investigation 
provided by the zionist New York Times indicates that the massacre was 
planned).
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     We saw Mélenchon, the representative of the new French social democracy, say in a rally in support of Gaza :
    </p>
<p>
     “Long live you Paris, of all colors and religions, you are the 
epitome of humanity. And eternal glory to Gaza and those who resist” The
 reader must notice the “honor” of being addressed to Paris, this 
cosmopolitan city, linked to a romantic love for Hamas. Mélenchon 
essentially shared with us this dangerous, almost Machiavellian poison 
of humanism, this idea that the Hamas movement only represents the 
quintessence of the human ideal of emancipation.
    </p>
<p>
     This is why this extreme left always highlights the horrific nature 
of Israeli crimes, with dead children, famine, old men forced to 
migrate, etc. This was seen on social networks, on which we saw leftists
 sharing gory images in order to shock the white middle class…. As if, 
if Israel was sympathetic in its war, these people would support Israel!
 We must be clear. Israel is an enemy, whether left or right, it must be
 exterminated.
    </p>
<p>
     The humanitarian situation was so terrible that an American soldier,
 Aaron Bushnell, self- immolated. We must understand that a man setting 
himself on fire is proof of a society in revolt. We remember when 
Vietnamese Buddhist students set themselves on fire in protest of the 
South Vietnamese comprador dictatorship, fully supported by America. We 
must salute the courage of this man, and may he rest in power.
    </p>
<p>
</p>

<p p="">
<p>
       In essence, they will affirm “Israel’s right to exist” while 
condemning the brazen and undeniable genocide, brutality and general 
violence of “Israel”, but also while refusing to acknowledge that no 
“Israeli” has any right to any part of Palestine and being perfectly 
content with the assimilation and more soft erasure of Arabs. An Arab to
 a neo-zionist is like an indigenous American to the US while to a 
post-zionist, they are more akin to an Afro-American. The erasure and 
destruction of the Arabs in Palestine and possibly across the whole of 
Arabia is a perfectly acceptable outcome for these chauvinistic 
scoundrels provided the Arab nation is too weak to resist and Israel 
destroys the people in less violent ways. They are not for this just 
cause and anyone who believes otherwise is a damn fool.
      </p>
<p>
       We must note the statement by the PFLP in response to the Western cries over Israeli crimes :
      </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
        We call on all living forces, including solidarity and trade unions,
 to escalate all forms of struggle and pressure aimed at stopping 
supplies destined to equip the zionist killing machine against our 
people, whether by opposing decisions to export arms and materials 
supporting the criminal occupation, or by direct objections aimed at 
obstructing the transportation and shipment of ammunition for 
extermination.
        <br>
        We stress the need for everyone to fulfill their duty 
to support the steadfastness of our people in Gaza Strip, both 
materially and morally, and the need to work to expand, develop and 
organize the forms and tools of support.
        <br>
        We call for organizing, 
institutionalizing and structuring these movements to ensure continuity 
and impact in order to save humanity from its moral predicament.
        <br/>
        We 
salute the global people movements and their living conscience that 
rejects the hysteria of the Zionist/imperialist war leadership. We 
especially salute the new pulse led by consciousness activists in the 
world, as a true, free, democratic and peaceful expression of victory 
for the universality of Palestine.”
        <br/>
        PFLP-26 February 2024
       </br></br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
       In short, the organization accepts some support from Western people,
 neglecting to mention the labor aristocracy. Why? We must explain 
something simple : the labor aristocracy theory is part of a western 
critique of the inefficiency of the western revolutionary movement. The 
third world never needed this theory for its forces. The PFLP kept the 
Brezhnevite strategy of supporting all communist parties, even the 
western degenerate ones.
      </p>
<p>
       The resistance groups movements which launched the initial war of 
liberation held a meeting in Moscow to talk between each other, invited 
by Putin’s envoy in the Middle East:
      </p>
<p>
       “In his speech, Fahd Suleiman (General Secretary of Democratic Front
 for Liberation of Palestine) emphasized the seriousness and deep sense 
of national responsibility that prevailed in the Palestinian meeting. He
 also praised the role played by Professor Naumkin in managing the 
meeting sessions, and the positive assistance he provided that provided 
the opportunity to agree on the positive statement issued by the two 
meetings, which necessarily bears the fingerprints of the Russian 
capital.”
      </p>
<p>
       Meanwhile the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
“delegation stressed the need to seize the opportunity for dialogue in 
Algeria despite the existing obstacles and difficulties, stressing that 
the Front delegation for dialogue will make sincere efforts to reach an 
agreement that puts an end to the division and actually begins the 
measures to build national unity. The Front delegation praised the role 
of the Russian Federation in supporting the struggle of the Palestinian 
people, as well as the importance of continuing this role and doing 
everything possible within international institutions to put an end to 
attacks and “Israeli” violations against our country, people and our 
land.”
      </p>
<p>
       In short all Palestinians are behind Russia against the West, in the
 goal of using them against America. This proved that the goal of the 
Arab resistance movements was never to destroy Jewry (contrary to the 
several claims of the Zionist medias that pretended the goal of Hamas 
was “to destroy Israel”) but to one last effort to bring the war on 
international grounds, to have the support of Russia, China and Iran 
against America.
      </p>
<p>
       PFLP and DFLP both support the idea of an “Islamic and Arab” Nation.
 This is a good development, since all Palestinian factions support in 
words the idea of an unitary Arab country.
      </p>
<p>
       The problem is that, apparently, Iran and Hezbollah were not warned 
of the battle, and so weren’t able to prepare themselves for the war 
against the zionist entity. Had they the political ambition to launch a 
total war against this Entity? We can’t be sure : Hezbollah didn’t start
 any Islamic Revolution, in a context where it is the most popular 
political force in Lebanon. To be a little provocative, the problem of 
Hezbollah is not that it is an “Islamist terrorist” group like MSM 
pretends to be, but that it is not nearly radical enough.
      </p>
<p>
       Meanwhile, it is probable that Israel prepares itself to invade 
Lebanon, as it bombs Lebanon daily and even uses chemical weapons 
against the South of Lebanon (I may remind people that this was the main
 criticism the degenerate leftoids had against Assad, that he apparently
 “used chemical weapons”!). Israel knows, thanks to the 2006 war, that 
it can’t invade Lebanon, and so has one goal : ending the war in 
Ukraine, so the West will concentrate all its forces and put all its 
financial power into consolidating the interests of the zionists.
      </p>
<p>
       The only solution to this genocide and all ongoing violations is 
unification of all Arabs against the zionist entity and foreign powers, 
and political revolution against all of the reactionary monarchies 
colluding with the Imperialists. Highlighting the criminal character of 
Israel may provide some reprieve should we receive a sufficient amount 
of miracles on the day in question, but there is no positive outcome 
that does not entail the eradication of the monstrosity known as Israel.

    This 
 Week is Newroz the Kurdish celebration of again. Newroz is for resistance 
 National of the Kurds an important day, this day stands out its own identity 
 national. The TKP/ML
    <a href="https://serviralpuebloperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/16/tkp-ml-ydk-newroz-es-una-celebracion-de-rebelion/">
     declared
    </a>
    :
    <i>
     “Newroz is an act of awakening, resurrection and taking 
 awareness of the chains themselves. Without a doubt, Newroz is a celebration to 
 those who tried to be enslaved, assimilated, whose culture was 
 destroyed and whose language was prohibited by the Turkish rulers due to their 
 National identity. It is a fight for awakening, resistance and 
 release of all these dominations of the Kurda nation, which is tried 
 Keep under national oppression. This fight for liberation was repressed 
 by the fascist dictatorship with massacres, destruction, prohibitions and 
 denials Newroz was prohibited by fascism as well as being Kurdo. ”
    </i>
    Until today the Kurdish people are permanent objective of assimilation campaigns or 
 genocide. The TKP/ml that fights in Dersim (region populated by the Kurds) 
 Highlights the right of self -determination of the Kurdish people against chauvinism 
 Kemalist who asserts that the Kurds are part of the Turkish people denying their 
 National identity.

    School students

 protests after the murder of the partner

     statement
     "No authority made available to 
 This FGE to the state police involved ... at no time is this prosecutor 
 State had in the quality of detainees these public servants ”
     . During 
 This demonstration the young people launched some firecrackers towards the 
 facilities and burned 11 official vehicles, reporting 17 agents 
 injured, 13 of the National Guard and 4 of Research. Today, March 18, the 
 Students made a lock-slope on the Sun Highway 
 Mexico-Acapulco demanding the Federal Government and the State Government 
 immediate delivery of the escaped police and the cessation to the lynching campaign against 
 Students and parents. Ayotzinapa compas denounced that 
 The date has been killed 11 students and missing another 43 of that 
 same institution. While the student community and parents 
 justice demand for Ayoztinapa - converted into the target of the attacks of 
 all levels of government and all bourgeois six years and parties 
 AMLO asks students
     <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">

     <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">
      "The army is uniformed people ... and there is no 
 President's instruction to suppress anyone ”

     And take the opportunity to hit 
 again to democratic organizations in resistance, holding that 
 They helped the regime ...
     <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">
      "Calling No 
 vote; All these organizations, even the supposedly more radical, low 
 the handling that all are the same, and that helped to delay and mediate the 
 change, transformation "
     </i>
     . The Federation of Socialist Peasant Students 
 of Mexico (FECSM) is right when sustaining mobilizations and providing them with 
 A combative character against the regime. The various electoral matches not only 
 They are the same, but all without exception belong to the great bourgeoisie and 
 They fulfill a counter-insurgent work. In that sense the call to maintain the 
 Fight for Truth and Justice for Ayoztinapa is as legitimate as the call to the 
 boycott against bourgeois electoral farce.
     <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">
      Curb 
 The war against the people! Do not vote, organize and fight! Ayotzi lives, the

<br>
   There is not much to add, to explain in the face of the serious statements of the President of the European Council, Charles Michel - which we report below - that speaks of "war economy" and if we want peace you have to make war.
  </br></b>
  Of course, we are in the period of European elections and the tones deliberately get strong to collect consents, but the statements made by Charles Michel go together with facts and other statements:
  <b>
   Yesterday the EU decided a new equipment of 4.5 billion at Ukraine, the first package of 50 billion; Macron also hypothesizes the sending of his soldiers to Ukraine; The doubling by the end of 2025 of the current military production is announced ...
  </b>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span style="font-family: arial;">
    In fact, an extension of the war is announced, at least in Europe, in the name of "our own security".
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
    What does it mean
   </span>
<span style="font-family: arial;">
    rebbe
   </span>
</b>
<span style="font-family: arial;">
   "
  </span>
<span style="font-family: arial;">
<b>
    War economy ", what effects would they be for the masses?
   </b>
   It would mean concentrating part of the economy, funds, production, resources in military production; Yes
  </span>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
   speaks of "duplicate assets" that is, assets that even born
  </span>
<span>
   For civil use, for medicine, scientific research, etc., they can be used for military purposes
  </span>
<span style="font-family: sans-serif;">
   ; Then move the government funding to military missions and armament, removing them more and more in funds for work, income, social services, health, school, etc.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   The "security" he is talking about is that of the imperialists, certainly not that of the popular masses
  </b>
  which would be, precisely from this extension of the interventions put at risk. And that it is not the "defense" the commissioner himself says when he declares that for the first time in the history of the EU, lethal weapons will be delivered to Ukraine.
 </p>
<p>
  The closure of this writing by Charles Michel is equally disturbing. He writes: this battle requires one
  <b style="background-color: transparent;">
   leadership forte:
  </b>
<span>
   To mobilize our citizens, our businesses and our governments ... ". What does" strong leadership "mean? If not the clear declaration that war and governments of modern fascism.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<b>
<span>
    Charles Michel: "If we want peace we have to prepare for war" - Gentiloni: "You have to hurry".
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p>
  "... the wind is changing, at least in the intentions of Brussels and a large front of capital, united in the conviction that
  <b>
   A new weapon race has begun
  </b>
  . And that, therefore,
  <b>
   Even the European bank ... it must now wear the helmet and finance projects for the defense
  </b>
  : the pressing is the subject of a letter signed yesterday by 14 countries, including
  <b>
   Italia,
  </b>
  France and Germany ....
 </p>
<p>
  ... how to finance the new common defense, however, it is still not known. The commissioner for the economy Paolo Gentiloni speaks of possible new common debt ... "
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   From the intervention of
  </b>
<b>
   Charles Michel President of the European Council
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  "... Russia represents a serious military threat for our European continent and for global security. If the EU reminder will not be adequate and if we do not provide Ukraine sufficient support to stop Russia, we will be the next.
 </p>
<p>
  We must therefore be ready to defend ourselves and
  <b>
   move on to a method of "war economy".
  </b>
  AND
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 The time has come to take responsibility for the
 <b>
  our own safety.
 </b>
 We can no longer count on others or be at the mercy of electoral cycles in the United States or elsewhere.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  We must strengthen our ability, both for Ukraine and Europe, to defend the democratic world.
  <b>
   A stronger Europe will also contribute to strengthening the NATO alliance and strengthens our collective defense.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  We can be proud of what we have done so far, but there is still a lot that we can and have to do.
 </p>
<p>
  In a phone call two days after the start of the war, President Zelensky asked the EU to send weapons. Together with the high representative Borrell
  <b>
   We worked with EU leaders to deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.
  </b>
  It had never happened before in the history of our union.
 </p>
<p>
  We also intensified our action on the military front. From the beginning of the war
  <b>
   The European Defense Industry has increased its production capacity by 50% and by the end of next year we will double the European production of ammunition, bringing it to over 2 million pieces.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  We have to do more to help Ukraine and strengthen our European defense. We must be able to speak not only the language of diplomacy,
  <b>
   but also that of power.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  This year, Russia should spend 6% of the GDP for the defense, while the EU continues to spend less than 2% of the GDP expected by the NATO goal on average.
 </p>
<p>
  For decades, Europe has not investing enough in our safety and defense. Today we are faced with the greatest security challenge from the Second World War, so we must strengthen our promptness to the defense. To do this, it will be necessary that
  <b>
   Our thought composes a radical and irreversible transition towards a Mentis form focused on strategic safety.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  We must give priority to Ukraine e
  <b>
   We must also spend more
  </b>
  , in an intelligent and less fragmented way ...
 </p>
<p>
  Our goal should be to
  <b>
   double our purchases by the European industry by 2030,
  </b>
  so as to guarantee greater predictability to our companies.
  <b>
   Multi -year contracts will also encourage them to increase their production capacity.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   Investments in the defense are expensive
  </b>
  , but without it is impossible to increase our production in this sector. We have to find ways for
  <b>
   facilitate industry access to both public and private funding.
  </b>
  Even the issue of European defense bonds in order to raise funds to buy material or make investments in our industry could represent a powerful means to strengthen our technological, industrial and innovation basis. We must also evaluate the possibility of expanding the mandate of the European investment bank and adapt the loan policy to allow us to do more in support of our European defense industry, for example
  <b>
   changing the definition of dual use assets.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  This battle requires one
  <b>
   strong leadership: to mobilize our citizens, our businesses and our governments
  </b>
  in favor of a new spirit of security and defense throughout the European continent.
 </p>
<p>
  If we want peace, we must prepare for war ".

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

   Europe is first and foremost a geographical concept, but 
 We talk about Western Europe and Eastern Europe, we are no longer talking 
 of geographical but economic-social concepts. As Engels said at the end of 
 19th century and Lenin reaffirmed, after 1905, Eastern Europe is not a 
 geographical concept but economic-social. This is necessary to advance because 
 We will find this reality when dealing with the agrarian problem in Europe, 
 In addition, that among the countries there are differences of degree and also within each 
 country, as for this problem there are regional differences, more marked in 
 Spain and Italy. In the same countries of Eastern Europe there are differences 
 among them.

Every time a people and youth dare to challenge the government and the rotten, exploitative system they represent, they find the various repressive mechanisms they have to hit the collective and organized old and the militants. It is precisely this line the persecutions against teachers for political and trade union action are also moved. This is a very serious issue related to the general direction of terrorism and suppression of militants, associations and movements, arising from the policy of fascisting public and political life.

   In this context, therefore, and in the need to connect the students' struggle with the workers, members of the racing moves have submitted a resolution to the BoD to support the mobilization of 21/3 at the Piraeus Municipal Theater. The PCF forces voted against it using cheap excuses. Overcoming the decisions by ELME that support the call, it has "annoyed" that the concentration is supported by organizations and colleges. This is probably by their logic impossible to discuss this and to be supported by a student club. They even presented a contradictory call to the Ministry of Education.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
   The same forces that act as a fire extinguisher of the movement and racing moods of the student masses, which have been on the road continuously for 10 weeks and which in some cases have supported them and DAP members, decided to stop the occupations. And not to enter new general assemblies and demonstrations. Teachers also take a similar attitude within the unions and do not support the mobilization, which is surrounded by trade unions and collectives and a variety of uninhabited world in the neighborhoods, while their own competitors are being prosecuted.
  </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<br/>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
   It turns out once again that in every effort to resist and claim the world, in every attempt to build a movement with truly racing characteristics they try to sabotage it. They oppose anything that goes beyond their virtual protests and can be a real obstacle to the attack of the system.

<p>
  The government has launched a pogrom of persecution, state violence and repression against struggles and fighters.
 </p>
<p>
  Teachers are prosecuted and disciplined because they were involved in mobilizations in the time of the pandemic and against evaluation or because they publicly criticized the government's policy. They dismissed EKPA employee, persecuting the president of PENEN and the president of the Piraeus Labor Center, illegally strikes as soon as they are announced, striking the demonstrations with MAT and tear gas. They arrest students and drag them into the courts because they fight against private universities. They impose a climate of fascism, criminalize trade union action aimed at terrorizing, silencing any voice of resistance, but mainly target workers and all the people to bend their heads and accept the policy of poverty, poverty and participation in the country. Wars of imperialists as "regularity".
 </p>
<p>
  The arrests of the 49 students and the slanderous lies of a "nuclear accident" that were channeled to the media, which was forced to deny the AUTH Rector himself, show that the system of exploitation and oppression does not hesitate to serve them in order to serve their targets. .
 </p>
<p>
  The government and the parties of the system that support its policy will not stop unless we stop them with our mass struggles. They need to unfold struggles against the barbaric policy that is destroyed by us but also persecution and state violence and repression. Do not pass the persecutions and the climate of terrorism. With our common coordinated struggles we can put a brake on those who deprive us of the rights in life and subjugate our lives for the interests of the ruling class and its imperialist protectors.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
   Down the hands of clubs, clubs and fighters!
  </li>
<li>
   To stop all the persecutions now
  </li>
</ul>

  We denounce the Call for testimony in the context of a SAD that received our competitor H. Hotzoglou today (Thursday 21/3).
 </p>
<p>
  Although we do not know the exact reason it is called, it is clear that it is about its trade union and political action. After all, there are multiple trade unions and political persecutions (whether disciplinary, criminal or both) that are being carried out both in Piraeus and nationwide. After all, a few days before our competitor G. Kavvadias had been invited to "written explanations" by the Disciplinary Department of Piraeus, for an article he had posted on the internet!
 </p>
<p>
  It clips with the climate of terrorism attempted to impose. With the terrorist 49 arrests of students at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. With the loud judicial decisions on strike abstaining from individual evaluation. In the circular sent by the NPEC where he points out that the assessment of the assessment operation is part of the penalties of the new Criminal Code (about the "shouts when people are entering a school unit").
 </p>
<p>
  It will not pass all this climate. The people will break it in the streets with their struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  Today's witness test is doubly provocative as the day of the mobilization of associations, bodies, and colleges against trade union and political persecution has been sent.
 </p>
<p>
  The best answer they can get is to be a truly massive and dynamic demonstration that will shout all the persecutions.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
<u>
    ALL today at 18:30 at the rally and demonstration at the Piraeus Municipal Theater
   </u>
</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
   President's intervention during the
   <em>
    South West Minga
   </em>
   In Cali on March 15, he caused a new stir in the country. Not because he has admitted his failure to agree on his intended “National Agreement”, nor for denouncing that Congress intends to sink the social reforms he proposed, nor to ensure that a new power needs to be built from below, through the popular assemblies ... but for its allusion to a constituent assembly.
  </p>
<p>
   Caused the uproar, Petro said that it was not about imposing the reforms that the Congress sank constituent, nor did it seek re -election, or change the Constitution, but to develop that of 91 on several fundamental problems, such as fulfilling the agreement of Paz, guarantee basic conditions of existence to the entire population, respond to climate change, reorder the territory, separate the policy of private financing and reform justice.
  </p>
<p>
   If the dark smoke created by the media is cleared against the president's contradictory discourse in Cali, several truths are exposed that the revolutionary proletariat and in particular the Communist Workers Union (MLM) had already warned and must highlight, regarding the recognition made by who promised the people to make the changes that the country needs from the government:
  </p>
<p>
   First, he accepted his failure to make a "national agreement", making it clear that conciliation between exploited and exploiters, between oppressed and oppressors is not possible. A reality warned by the UOC (MLM) before the president's possession when he said it was impossible
   <a href="https://revolucionobrera.com/editorial/presidente/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
    Serve God and Devil at the same time
   </a>
   . A recognition that Colombian society is torn by the struggle of classes, configuring two antagonistic poles: on the one hand, the working people and, on the other, the dominant parasitic classes and imperialism.
  </p>
<p>
   Second, the president denounced that Congress is not an institution that serves the people, but is on his back to him; As demonstrated by the imminent sinking of the reforms, which only contained some measures in favor of the workers, but that the exploiting ruling classes, in their insatiable thirst for profits, refuse to grant, condemning the poor to the Paseo de la Death and to whom They produce all the richness to live in destitution.
  </p>
<p>
   The fact is that despite the change of government, popular claims have not been resolved, the economic, social and political conditions that cause the uprising of 2019, 2020 and 2021 continue to be aggravated, and the patience of the people is being exhausted, tending their outrage Towards a new uprising against his enemies.
  </p>
<p>
   Third, again the president recognized the need of popular assemblies as the exercise of the direct democracy of the people, and even recognized them as a way of building popular power from below.
  </p>
<p>
   In that regard and independent of whether the president will be consistent until the end with promoting popular assemblies and supporting the decisions they make, or it is only a way of pressing Congress and the rich, or campaigning for 2026, expresses something raised by the UOC (MLM) before Petro's possession: the popular assemblies were the best creation of the masses during the lifting of 2021, to the extent that they constituted embryonic forms of the new power, embryonic forms of the new state of the exploited and oppressed; Instruments for the struggle with which the immediate claims of the people can be conquered and carry out the transformations that the country needs, to the extent that they raise their level of consciousness, discard constitutional illusions and act independently of the State.
  </p>
<p>
   On the other hand, oblivious to that reality recognized by the same president, the heads of the CUT, CTC, a sector of the CGT and the National Coordinator for Change (the old CNP without the Dignity Group of Robledo that is now a part of the opposition) call the mobilization for the "National Agreement" and to support their representatives in Congress so that this rotten institution proceeds the reforms proposed by the Government. The Heads of the Centrals and the CNP re -educated return to the traces of the parades in support of Congress instead of mobilizing and organizing the foundations for the fight against the declared enemies of the people.
  </p>
<p>
   Thus, it is the obligation of the conscious proletariat to go to the way to the illusions that the reformism has and sows that it is possible to make the current state of the exploiters serve the people. Requirement that makes the unity of the revolutionaries urgent and necessary, without giving up the discussion of divergences, but putting over them and of any group interest the interests of the people:
  </p>
<p>
   Unity to promote, promote and organize popular assemblies regardless of the parties of the bourgeoisie, the State and even the government, in such a way that they contribute to preparing the masses for the new and inevitable confrontation against their enemies; Assemblies that allow organizing the fight to conquer popular claims, collected in the
   <em>
<a href="https://revolucionobrera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Programa-Inmediato-2024.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
     Immediate program
    </a>
</em>
   proposed by the UOC (MLM) as the basis of unity, and because to the extent that the popular masses join and organize, recover self -confidence and in the power they have, they will discard the illusions sown by reformism in the reformism in the Bureaucratic and politician procedures in the bourgeois state, learning in their own experience the right path.
  </p>
<p>
   Unity to immediately specify a popular national assembly that organizes the fight in response to the ruling classes and as opposed to the institutions of the bourgeois, landowner and pro -imperialist state, which refuse to resolve the distressing situation of the working people.
  </p>
<p>
   Urgent and necessary unity, we reiterate, so that a popular national assembly goes to the way to reformism and prevents the rebellion that grows in the bowels of the people and the path of the struggle, to be channeled again for another bourgeois institutional exit, and even for prevent or respond to a coup attempt.
  </p>
<p>
   Unity to raise the awareness of workers in the need of the revolution, when it is time to consider practically the task of destroying the old machine of domination of the exploiters to give life to the new state of the workers and the construction of the new Society, free of capitalist exploitation and imperialist semicolonial domination.
  </p>
<p>
   This is the path we prepare and with which we are committed. That is why we call other communists, revolutionaries and the true leaders of the people to unity; A call to fulfill our obligation as representatives of the working people.

  The Mediterranean, Africa and the Middle East are the other front 
 of war lit by the interimperialist dispute, with troops 
 military of imperialist governments on the ground to strengthen the axis 
 of terror, together with their Zionist ally, against the Arab peoples 
 with Palestine in the center.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This 
 war front is strategic for the Italian imperialist state, ce 
 The governments and the so -called are repeating it until nausea 
 "Analysts" close to the Italian military-industrial apparatus, e 
 The Meloni/Crosetto/Tajani government is precisely on interventionism 
 Italian imperialist who focuses a lot, Meloni swelled it 
 so much so as to push the press enslaved to baptize it “Piano 
 Mattei ”, to give him an apparently strategic guise for 
 Instead, hiding the reality made of refusals contracted to 
 reactionary governments, of profits derived from the robbery of resources 
 energy and from the goods that pass through the area, of imposition 
 of the iron heel of the imperialist armies to crush the 
 aspirations of peoples and dominating the world trade that passes 
 in the Red Sea.

 of Europe to grow 
 as consent and legitimize their repression policies e 
 oppression, both within the respective imperialist states, and 
 outside against the peoples.
 <p>
</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  In 
 This context on Sunday 17 March was held in the visit to Cairo del 
 President of the Council of Italian Ministers, Meloni, together with 
 President of the European Commission, von der Leyen, always 
 available when he has to support the racist policies of 
 Antimmigrati rejections in the company of the Government Capa of 
 Italian (nobody can and must forget the massacre of migrants a 
 Cutro, where on those who died of Italian and European responsibilities 
 The two torture had strengthened their unit). Of the delegation 
 which aimed at the strengthening of the EU-Egypt strategic partnership has 
 The President of the Republic of Cyprus, current 
 President of the EU Council, the first ministers of Greece e

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  I am 
 went to sign the new EU-Egypt pact, a 7.4 billion plan 
 euros, between loans and subsidies.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The 
 Cairo from the EU is considered "reliable partner", a 
 "Mediterranean security pillar", as we read 
 in the joint declaration.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Furthermore 
 The adjective "historical" could not miss this time even 
 in defining political, commercial, military agreements. Each step 
 politician of the Meloni government rests on empty words that cloak the 
 His imperialist, neocolonial politics.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This 
 of the European partnership was one of the legs on which the 
 imperialist strengthening of the Al Sisi regime in Egypt, the other 
 They are bilateral relationships Italy-Egypt that materialize in new ones 
 Memorandum.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  With the 
 Agreements with Libya, Tunisia and Albania, the Meloni government pursues the 
 same way also with Egypt his policy to prevent the 
 departures of migrants fleeing hunger and wars with concentration camps where 
 lock them up, a policy strengthened by the Meloni/planted government 
 of criminalization/repression of the NGOs engaged in the rescue in 
 sea.
 </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   “The crisis of Gaza 
 It is at the top of our concerns, "said Meloni but,, 
 Since he did absolutely nothing to stop the genocide 
 of the Israeli Nazisionist state against Gaza and all of Palestine 
 occupied and bombed, the so -called "concerns" of his and the 
 governments are only for preventing the departures of migrants e 
 suffocate the support also armed with the resistance of the people of the 
 Yemen, defined by the "Ribelli Houthi" press, which, in the name of 
 that solidarity with the Palestinian people, affects the interests 
 of imperialism that instead supports the terrorist n ° 1 of the area, 
 the Nazisionist state of Israel and attacks the goods of the 
 Imperialists passing through the Red Sea.
  </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   THE 
 regimes asserted for imperialism thus become a sting 
 indispensable and imperialist governments of them spin rivers of 
 money. In Italy this pompously call it "Piano Mattei" 
 and the model that the Italian government is proud of is that 
 signed with Sieda's Tunisia last September, also, 
 Not surprisingly, baptized by Meloni and von der Leyen.
  </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The fire 
 of the war - or rather - of the genocide in progress in Palestine from 
 part of the Naziosionist occupant of Israel, supported 
 from western imperialism with the US on their heads and with the role 
 Active, accomplice, of the Italy of the Meloni government, has broken down in 
 Middle, for the support of the resistance of Yemen to 
 Palestinian resistance and with the influx of weapons, military, US/EU 
 in the Red Sea with the aim of extinguishing political solidarity 
 and military of the peoples to the Palestinian cause and for open support 
 to the Nazisionist genocide.
  </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Hold up 
 Al-Sisi means first of all to run to help him to support 
 The whole apparatus of domination of the coup, from the military to the banks, 
 who brought the Egyptian people to their knees to which they now do 
 add the migratory waves from Gaza and Sudan, created by 
 same imperialists.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The rejections of the 
 migrants will be one of the themes of the G7 so it is a central question for 
 An anti -imperialist struggle.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The initiative 
 European follows the economic support that Egypt is 
 insured by the United Arab Emirates and the Monetary Fund 
 international (IMF). Between the end of February and the beginning of March 
 Cairo received 10 billion dollars provided by a fund 
 Emiratine. A project that provides for an initial investment of 35 
 billions of dollars and which will allow you to replenish the coffers of the 
 State, on which they burdened the effects of the war in the strip 
 of Gaza. On 6 March, the IMF announced that it wants to increase 
 from 3 to 8 billion dollars the value of the loan that will provide 
 to Egypt in exchange for the economic reforms that, translated, 
 It means downloading with repression, with imposition, the whole 
 austerity policy of the Egyptian reactionary regime against his 
 same people.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   On the situation 
 Egyptian economic weighs a debt that, according to World data 
 Bank of September 2023, amounts to 164.5 billion dollars. The rate 
 of annual inflation rose to 36% in January, without possibility 
 of contraction within a short time - also because the central bank 
 has decided to make the pound exchange rate flexible 
 Egyptian (now exchanged at 50 per dollar, against the 30 average of the 
 2023).
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Help 
 economically the coup at Sisi means, as a counterpart, 
 obtain his involvement in the repression of migrants and, for 
 Italian imperialism, this also means the profits related 
 to the exploitation of energy resources, strategic topic for 
 the imperialist countries, which for this reason are scanning and there are there 
 dragging into the world slaughterhouse.
  </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    So I'm not there 
 Only anti -maid rejections in this agreement between Meloni and al 
 Sisi, there is also energy supply: Eni has

    It produces about 60% of the country's total gas production 
 North African and also manages the gas export system

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    For Italy 
 imperialist represented by the Meloni government was 
 sign an agreement with the Golder at Sisi precisely coinciding with 
 The hearing of the trial for the death of Giulio Regeni, the young man 
 Italian researcher, killed and tortured horribly by the services 
 Egyptian secrets of which he is headed by Sisi, and this hearing began the 
 March 18 in Rome.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    Nothing can put 
 The relations between Italy and Egypt are under discussion, they do not count 
 massacres or human rights violations, indeed, are strengthened 
 the civil business and, above all, the military one that has grown 
 dizzyingly, with the Fincantieri and the 
 Leonardo.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    On this the 
 Egyptian president at Sisi, in the presence of Eni's AD, Claudio 
 Descalzi, declared that "the assassination was committed for 
 ruin relations with Italy "and" to damage Egypt " 
 and, aimed at Descalzi, “knows why they wanted to damage the 
 Relations between Egypt and Italy? So that we did not arrive here ”. But 
 Not only have they arrived so far, they also went on.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    In the last five 
 years the Italian war industries exported to the strength 
 armed with Al Sisi, the former head of the Egyptian Golder Army, from 
 Little re -elected triumphantly for the third time, for the value 
 total of two billion and 39 million euros. According to the 
 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), in fact, 
 For 2024 3 billion dollars would already be at stake for 
 the purchase of twenty-four Eurofighter Typhoon-2 hunting hunting 
 of Cairo.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    The Leonardo 
 of the CEO Cingolani, former minister of 
 ecological transition, a company that has the minister in his book-Pag 
 Crosetto is rubbing hands for the umpteenth time.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    Industries 
 Italian war exported to the Egyptian Armed Forces in the 
 last five years weapons for the total value of 2 billion and 39 
 millions of euros.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    So, behind the 
 propaganda of this government, there is the substance of politics 
 Italian imperialist: antimmigratic profits and rejections.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    And against it it is 
 maximum proletarian opposition, mass, necessary, 
 Antimperialist, supportive with the armed resistance of peoples.

     Epistle of the poets that will come
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">
    Manuel Scorza
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Maybe tomorrow the poets ask
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Why we do not celebrate the grace of the girls;
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Maybe tomorrow the poets ask
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Why our poems
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     They were long avenues
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     where the burning anger came.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     I answer:
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Everywhere we heard the crying,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Everywhere we were a wall of black waves.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Was it going to be poetry
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     A lonely dew column?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It had to be perpetual lightning.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     While someone suffers,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The rose cannot be beautiful;
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     While someone looked at the bread with envy,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Wheat cannot sleep;
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     While it rains on the beggars's chest,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     My heart will not smile.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Kill sadness, poets.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Let's kill sadness with a stick.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Do not say the romance of the lilies.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     There are higher things
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     What to cry lost loves:
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The rumor of a town that awakens
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It's more beautiful than dew!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The glowing metal of its anger
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It is more beautiful than the foam!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     A free man
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It is more pure than the diamond!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The poet will release the fire
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     of his ash prison.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The poet will turn on the bonfire
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Where this gloomy world is burned.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  In recent months, more than 4,326 hectares of land were affected by terrible forest fires caused by the landowner or arising as a phenomenon of the Seiaje season. In addition to this, in various regions of Oaxaca such as the central valleys, Mixteca and Costa, mainly, a water crisis that threatens whole populations, and now also to hospitals and public schools has been observed.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The clear example is the situation of the General Hospital “Dr. Aurelio Valdivieso ”, in the middle of Oaxaca capital, which on February 22 had to suspend tasks to run out of water. Obviously a hospital cannot work without providing minimal health conditions for patients and medical personnel, and for this the drinking water service is indispensable. In this regard, the Human Rights Ombudsman of Oaxaca initiated a background notebook and issued precautionary measures where he asks
  <em>
   "Comprehensive actions to the State that avoid producing damage of difficult or impossible reparation to detriment to the right to citizenship."
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Now, in the same capital of the entity, there is talk of at least 6 public schools that have had to suspend tasks and return to the online classes to the total shortage of water in its facilities. The most recent have been the Morning Elementary School "Carlos A. Carrillo", located in the Reforma neighborhood, and the morning elementary school "Enrique Pestalozzi", located in the center of the city. Leave childhood without access to drinking water within its schools also attentive against their right to education and health, among others contemplated within the best interests of childhood.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Until a few weeks ago the shortage of drinking water was concentrated in the popular colonies generally located on the periphery and the hills of the city, nothing new. For decades there are dozens of colonies and neighborhoods called “irregular settlements” where the poor people do not have access to drinking water or other public services; In the same situation there are hundreds of schools in those same neighborhoods. The different governments in turn have systematically ignored this situation, leaving the solution in the hands of the residents who have had to hire private pipes that take advantage of the era of the era to speculate with water prices.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  But now that the water crisis has reached the downtown area of the city and the "good" colonies such as Reforma, San Felipe, etc. The situation has become a scandal; Even more when visible public institutions such as the General Hospital and the aforementioned schools must have suspended work at the shortage of water.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At the same time in Oaxaca, cooling companies and breweries continue to work normally, as are large hotels, restaurants, vice centers and even spas that prepare for Holy Week and beautiful tourism. None of these are lacking water at all.
 </p>
<p>
  Are we facing a phenomenon of drought or looting? You answer.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  If during the pandemic, health emergency and suspension of work of these industries and businesses were decreed, the same should be done in the midst of this water crisis that is also a sanitary crisis, in addition to regulating the price of water sold by the piperos organized in union mafias.
 </p>
<p>
  Guarantee universal access to drinking water as a fundamental right is a vital necessity and not the elections at the door. The money spent on campaigns and candidates should be invested in community collection and water supply systems for the people.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  After an agreement with the government, the National Congress today approved a project of the new high school. The project has undergone some modifications, but maintained the essentials of the content was criticized for months in strikes and protests of teachers and students across the country, as hundreds of hours for optional subjects without scientific content and models harmful to complete school education .
 </p>
<p>
  Within the one approved by the House, is:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
   Loss of hours of scientific training: In regular education, the division will be 2,400 hours for compulsory subjects and 600 hours for optional subjects. In other words, the loss of 600 hours in traditional and essential disciplines in high school for “formative itineraries”, mostly composed, especially in public schools, of disciplines without scientific content, such as “computational thinking”, “life project And similar aberrations. In technical education, the division will be 2,100 hours for compulsory subjects, with the possibility of 300 of them being compatible between basic general training and technical education, and 1,200 hours for the chosen technical course.
  </li>
<li>
   Discipline umbrella: fusion of different disciplines essential to student education in “large areas”, made mandatory. They are: languages and their technologies, which integrates Portuguese language and literature; English language; Arts (multiple languages and expressions); physical education; mathematics and their technologies; Natural Sciences and their Technologies, which will bring together important disciplines such as biology, physical and chemistry in a single great umbrella; and applied human and social sciences, which will do the same with philosophy, geography, history and sociology.
  </li>
<li>
   Formative itineraries: In the new project, each regular (non -technical) school should offer at least two formative itineraries. These optional disciplines should contemplate at least one of the above areas, but there is no clear specification of how much content or menu should be related to scientific areas, so that it leaves the space for anticientific courses such as those that have been massively implemented in schools that They adopted the measure in the last year; In technical schools, there is the option of training the technical and professional training course;
  </li>
<li>
   Formalization of Distance Learning: The project has established that formative itineraries can be taught at a distance, while the basic general training workload can be offered in person and, exceptionally, “mediated by technology”. There is not yet a regulation that specifies how mediation will be given.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Far-right celebrates
 </h4>
<p>
  After approval, parliamentarians of the far right were rushed to celebrate the text agreed between the government and the congress. The new chairman of the House Education Commission, the notorious reactionary Nikolas Ferreira (PL-MG), was one of those who praised the approved project. In a note published on social networks, the deputy cynically stated that he will maintain high supervision by applying the measure and the “demands of our students”.
 </p>
<p>
  The comment is a blatant derision: approval directly contradicted the interests of students and teachers who criticized and condemned even in important mobilizations across the country throughout the last year. Instead of a reformulation in neither, teachers and students required the total revocation of the measure.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Changed, but left the same
 </h4>
<p>
  In the new approval, all the content criticized by the students do not even remained. In strikes, student occupations, and protests, education professionals and students required the end of “formative itineraries” and the return of the schedule for regular disciplines and condemned the widespread confusion caused by the fusion of multiple scientific disciplines in widespread. Distance learning was also, as a rule, rejected in the demonstrations. Entities such as the National Executive of Pedagogy Students (Exnepe), who coordinated campaigns and fights against Nem, even classified the reform as the “most serious attack on public education in recent years”.
 </p>
<p>
  Denunciations after the application of the measure also reveals how it does not even favor the precariousness of teaching work, with professionals subject to increasing exploitation, in exhaustive hours and work not related to their areas of training, the precariousness of teaching, especially the public and Free, with the offer of an anti -cinientific and pragmatist teaching (not technical education, such as propagands figures such as Nikolas Ferreira), consequently, school dropout.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Fight must be resumed
 </h4>
<p>
  Even so, the government has never really considered to meet the requirement to revoke the neither and opted for conciliation with the measure. Last month, the Minister of Education, Camilo Santana, said he expected to approve the measure “this semester, because to implement changes in high school to 2025 need to be approved this semester, because it needs to have the time for the networks to be prepare for change. Approval is essential this semester in the House and Senate ”.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, the climate that can be expected is to resume students' struggles against Nem and the coming attacks on education promoted by the celemented reactionaries and conciliators on duty.

 Lenin says that to develop the political consciousness of the proletariat, it is necessary to bring the denunciation of every manifestation of will and oppression to the working class.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  But of course, does it act immediately after the problem "How to do it? Do we have enough forces to do it? Is there a terrain for this work in all other classes? Will it not mean this or will not lead this to a renunciation of the class point of view?".
 </p>
<p>
  Even more justified questions if we look today, under the conditions of organization, numbers and paintings of the communist organization, and in particular of ours. Questions to which the easy answer that comes is No.
 </p>
<p>
  But Lenin's answer is other. He starts from the assumption that the communists are primarily "theoretical ... propagandists, agitators and organizers". And he adds: "But very little is done in this sense. Too little compared to what is done for the study of the peculiarities of factory life", indeed - we say - of the attention that lends itself to the life and struggles of the other sectors of workers. Lenin insists that there are
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 companions, committees, etc. who even sink into the specialist study of trade union struggles, while they do not do, or do to extremely limited extent, the work that Lenin asks to actually raise the consciousness of workers and workers in struggle.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Their commitment made in the trade union struggles forgets that - as Lenin says - "it is not social democratic those who in fact forget that the communists support any revolutionary motorcycle and that, consequently, we must expose, underline the general tasks before all the people, without hiding even for a moment our socialist beliefs ", and educating in our work in the factory and proletarian struggles the workers and the proletariat in general to deal with all general problems and put themselves at the forefront of all democratic political struggles that develop In society, first of all, in the initial phase, with position sockets.
 </p>
<p>
  The forces to do this are there. The alternative that economists and economist mentality in the communists' ranks suggest to us is to "develop a tradunionist policy". And on this Lenin is stakeholder:
  <b>
   "The tradunionist policy of the working class is precisely the
   <i>
    bourgeois politics
   </i>
   of the working class ".
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Even in the other sectors and movements to which we turn, the action of the communists does not consist so much in directing the struggle for their immediate interests - for example the struggle of the students - but in bringing the position of the communists, the position of the Party of the working class; Because only in this way is Lenin realize: "We must transform social democratic militants into political leaders who know how to direct all the manifestations of this struggle" and are able to dictate in this struggle "a positive action program to students in agitation, To the representatives of the dissatisfied Zemstva, to the members of the indignant religious seven, to the masters affected in their interests, etc. ".
 </p>
<p>
  This is to be revolutionary avant -garde and expression of the avant -garde worker that we have called to take a position, and through it begin to react to all forms of political and social oppression of the bourgeoisie, of its state, of its government.
 </p>
<p>
  If this is, therefore, the task of the communists, permanent of the communists, if it is understood that this is a task to be fulfilled from the beginning of our activity, one can understand the attention that at this point Lenin places on the actual forces that You have, and consider the inevitable type of activity for granted at the beginning: "We actually had very few strength. Then it was natural and legitimate to be determined entirely in the work between the workers and seriously blame any removal from it, then the only purpose It was to strengthen in the working class ".
 </p>
<p>
  Here too, however, the problem is: with what conception, with what practice, with what propaganda and agitation do you jump entirely among the workers and strengthen ourselves in the working class? With trade union policy, tradunionist, with its economist's development, or with communist policy, albeit at the beginning of the process of roots and organization for the construction of the party? With the idea that in the working class this work cannot be done, which comes after we have conducted the trade union activity and consequently to the development of it, or with propaganda and agitation, albeit in the very difficult conditions that are there today in Fila of the working class?
 </p>
<p>
  Here too Lenin is very precise: "The ideal audience for political complaints is precisely the working class, which needs first of all and above all of a lively and complete political knowledge and which is the most suitable for transforming this knowledge into active struggle, even if this does not promise any "tangible result".
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, this is the only way that the working class has to become a point of reference for the struggle and opposition of all the layers of society. And this is the growing role that the working class, first with the avant -garde only with the active struggle, can allow us to "become a political force in the eyes of others". And to become this "you have to work a lot and with tenacity to raise our conscience, our spirit of initiative and our energy". And - insists Lenin - "It is not enough to attack the avant -garde label on a theory and a rearguard practice".

  The Madrid popular movement managed to avoid the eviction of the CPK (Kolelectivized political center) La Bankarrota, which was scheduled on Wednesday, March 20. The eviction was scheduled at 08: 00h and the presence of the UIP (Police Intervention Unit), the riot. The Buitre “Arguijo” Fund wanted to expel the masses that were organized to conquer it, which in its day snatched the financial entity Caja Madrid. But the police, a faithful prey dog of the financial capital (embodied this time in the vulture background "argue"), I cannot dislodge the center.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2ad6116eaf4ec54313d7997f5f53a403">
  The presence of the masses was greater and better organized than the State's repression forces could think. Seeing that there was not enough police presence to execute the eviction, those responsible for eviction sent to the Judicial Commission to delay it and mark a new date (even without schedule, that we know, today). In this way the eviction was avoided: with the organization and mobilization of the masses, which before 08:00, presented themselves in the surroundings willing to put their body before the riot units. Although this victory is temporary and the financial capital will try again to snatch the building, we are sure that the popular movement will defend, once again, these physical spaces of political organization of the working class.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-81220136960a497065038e35b73e5ac8">
  The CPK La Bankarrota has been a physical center of political organization of the masses, especially those of the Moratalaz neighborhood, which is where it is located (Palacios Encomienda street, number 46). In the call to defend the social center, CPK itself wrote: “
  <em>
   During the last 9 years, the Bankarrota has served as a meeting space for multiple groups of Moratalaz and Madrid. From here evictions have stopped, they have been able to raise funds for repressive expenses, very interesting talks and debates have been made, it has served as a political refuge for many organizations
  </em>
  ”.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-206adddb063cdc5b8154877ba09e83cf">
  The defense of the CPK La Bankarrota is a breath of fresh air in a month of intense heat. On March 13, the Railway (also in Madrid) and the CSO L’Obrera (Sabadell) was evicted. A day later, on 14, CSO Loira (Zaragoza). In fact, this concatenation of repressive acts is such that a good part of the popular movement considers that this March has begun one "
  <em>
   War against social centers ”.
  </em>
  This war will be long, with evictions that are gone and others that are lost, but the fight must continue until there are
  <em>
   Ten, one hundred, thousand social centers!
  </em>
  [slogan that was heard in the mobilization that avoided the eviction].
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c6a0d153e5222992405a41c5994f5ccb">
  The author of this article considers that this
  <em>
   guerra
  </em>
  It is part of the crisis and decomposition process of imperialism, and militarization of states. In this specific case, the offensive against social centers is within the logic of the Spanish state militarization process. Moreover, taking into account the maximum importance of the housing sector in our country, where financial capital is particularly more aggressive than in other sectors of the economy. It is enough to remember that the financial capital skips all bourgeois legality when required. The best example is that their most reactionary shock troops (landslide companies) are openly fascist pseudo-paramilitaries.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6e1d2961a81fee07dbe72905d10afef0">
  We will be alert until you know which eviction is.

  On the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March a combative and anti-imperialist contingent took part to the demonstration organized by Fosse aux Lyons and CFP. This contingent expressed their support to the heroic Palestinian national resistance and especially the women of Gaza. The protesters carried a banner with the slogans “Support for our sisters in Gaza who fight against imperialism and patriarchy! Palestine will win!” and shouted slogans in support of armed struggle, against Zionism and imperialism. Several speeches took a stance against US imperialism and Zionism, and also French imperialism and its treatment of the Mahorese women was condemned. Nouvelle Epoque reports that the contingent was well received among the masses.

  celebrating the 8

  of March. The panel was attended by women representatives of the League of Poor Peasants of the Northeast (LCP-NE), a representative of the Committee for the Defense of the Agrarian Revolution (CDRA) of the José Ricardo Revolutionary Area and a teacher from the Elizabete Teixeira People’s School. During the event, a daycare service was organized in order to allow peasant mothers to take part. Following the Internationale, the principles of the People’s Women’s Movement were presented and there was reading and discussion about the origin of the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, a part of the MFP bulletin. At the end, it was discussed and defined how women could increase their participation in the struggle to recover water sources and land from the old Frei Caneca plantation. In this way, the plenary session led the formation of an agitation and propaganda committee to recover water sources and organize a daycare service so that women can actively participate in recovering the land. The session ended with the Anthem of the Revolutionary Fighters and many slogans from the warriors of the southern forest of Pernambuco.

  . The struggle of the women who took part
  <a href="https://nuevademocracia.com.co/?p=26117">
   has been criminalized
  </a>
  by members of the ruling classes, with posters published accusing some of the women of vandalism, as well as intimidation and detention carried out by the police against women for such reasons as wearing green or purple scarves. Now women’s organizations are denouncing that the old State is quick to repress the protest of women but don’t punish the murderers and rapists of women. Posters have been put up and slogans have been painted by revolutionary women condemning the criminalization of protest.

   We publish an unofficial translation of the Weekly Editorial of

</p>
<p>
  When Luiz Inácio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on.
 </p>
<p>
  While investigations prove that a considerable part of the High Command of the Armed Forces and senior officials, even in minority, mobilized to consummate the military coup, president Luiz Inácio reiterated his guidance: not to promote acts or events condemning the 60th anniversary of the coup of 1964.
 </p>
<p>
  To prove the error of this government policy, it would be enough to mention how the reactionary sectors of the ruling classes received it. Representing the military right, the ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mourão had no doubts: “He’s right, that’s the past,” he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Estadão [newspaper], used to criticizing Luiz Inácio, was quick to defend him: “Lula acts correctly” by refusing to talk about the 1964 coup in its 60 years, in line with “an imperative of governability in a context of wounds waiting to heal” and “it is also a way of honoring the current military command, also architect of pacification”, he stated in the editorial “Lula’s accommodation with the military” (March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estadão, which has already advocated for the government to reopen the Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances (CEMDP), something that Luiz Inácio refuses to do, capitulates by echoing this government’s cowardly complicity.
 </p>
<p>
  Only the reactionary ideologues – committed above all to the continued exploitation of the people and the Nation – and the opportunists, whose mentality has been emasculated by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of the popular masses, believe that appeasement will lead to the stabilization of the country.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the results of the elections (2018) by taking away Luiz Inácio from the race, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote on that candidate in the Supreme Court.
  </p>
<p>
   As we see: long before Bolsonaro took the presidency – and independently of him – the latent wound of the coup was again manifesting itself acutely, especially because it had not been properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with the gorillas and transition with the Amnesty military regime of General and Unrestricted Amnesty, led in which there was no punishment, no change in the high military officials, nor in the training curriculums, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which they followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as “democratic revolution”, and when it was removed from the front of management of the old State, it took back the belief that the Armed Forces were the Moderating Power and guarantors of the “Democratic State of Law” – and, therefore, also guarantors of its restriction or even suspension, as Bolsonaro shamelessly tried to do.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    When Luiz Inácio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on. When the masses rise up in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, the gorillas, as the Moderating Power they believe in, will rise again threatening the Country with military intervention to save the Nation from “disintegration”. Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and weakened, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup escalation.
   </p>
<p>
    Appeasement with the military leadership only feeds the coup!
   </p>
<p>
    For genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, as well as the popular masses in struggle, there is no other path left than to forcefully raise the campaign to denounce the 60 years of the ignominious coup of 1964 and the coup, whether in the form of institutional rupture or in the form of “Moderating Power”. Compromises with fascists and coup plotters are not acceptable – which would only lead us to coup and fascism.

</p>
<p>
  The President of the Generality, Pere Aragonès, announced last Wednesday, March 13, that the regional elections were expedited to May 12. What should be the opinion of the revolutionaries on this matter? With this opinion article we aim to clarify some fundamental questions.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   The parties of the Catalan bourgeoisie have betrayed the Catalan proletariat and people again and again
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The torrent of mobilization and fury of the Catalan national liberation movement, whose qualitative leap we saw on October 1, 2017 with the holding of the referendum declared illegal by the Spanish State – and its subsequent repression – has led to nothing. We must learn a lesson from what happened.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   “Thank goodness ours govern and not the PP and Vox” they say in the TV3 gatherings. The reality is that ERC, Junts and PSC govern exactly the same as PSOE, PP and Vox. The Catalan bourgeois politicians are class enemies of the proletariat and enemies of the people. They seek independence only for their economic interests, they do not hesitate to crush the proletariat and they absolutely do not care about the Catalan language and culture.
  </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
    The national liberation movement at the crossroads:
   </strong>
<br>
<strong>
    follow the bourgeois path or the proletarian path?
   </strong>
</br></h2>
<p>
   There are two paths in the Catalan national liberation movement: the bourgeois path and the proletarian path. The two paths are completely different in class interests, method and objectives.
  </p>
<p>
   The bourgeois path serves the Catalan bourgeoisie, which seeks the independence of Catalonia from the Spanish State to become imperialist itself, continue oppressing its own people and take the leap to oppress other peoples in the world. The bourgeois path keeps the proletariat and the people in poverty, as it has done for centuries. Increase in prices and increase in the CPI, labor exploitation, increase in rents, evictions and police violence, etc. The Catalan bourgeois politicians in Barcelona have governed in the same way as the Spanish bourgeois politicians in Madrid. The bourgeois path urges the masses to participate in the electoral farce, seeking to extinguish the people’s desire for democratic rights and freedoms and spreads racism and chauvinism against the people (both the Spanish people and the oppressed nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia).
  </p>
<p p="">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
     Boycott the electoral farce!
    </strong>
</h2>
<p>
    During the last few years, revisionists and opportunists of all kinds have called on the masses to participate in the electoral farce, to voice their political demands in parliament and to continue down the bourgeois path. The bourgeois path only serves the bourgeoisie. You cannot change the bourgeois State from within, you cannot change a machine of oppression from within. Much less can independence be achieved by participating within the institutions of the Spanish State (Generality, Provincial Councils, City Councils, …) and being part of it.
   </p>
<p>
    In an article published in Servir al Pueblo, it was explained, in a summarized way, why to apply the boycott. We reproduce it in full:
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     1. Why to boycott the elections?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because we chose the revolutionary path and socialism, the power of the working class against the bourgeoisie. The participation in the elections, directly or not directly, has nothing to do with the path to the socialism (proletarian revolution).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because the elections inside the Bourgeois State are a farce. This is the reason that we call them electoral farce or electoral farce of the bourgeoisie. There are not a farce because are rigged, but because don’t matter what you are gonna vote: there is no any democracy. All the really important decisions, absolutely all of them, are being decided in other ways and not in the parliamentary one.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because with the elections we chose the government, but not the State or the ruling class. The turn government is just the administrator of the interests of the financial oligarchy, the imperialist bourgeoisie, which is the ruler of the Spanish State. There is no substantial difference between all the governments of the Bourgeois democracy in the recent history (approximately, since 1975).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     2. Why to vote is useless to stop fascism?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because the recent fascistization of the State (more presence on the streets and in the mass media of fascist parties/organizations, more influence of reactionary ideas, etc…) is the logic consequence of the militarization of the Spanish State. Since 1980, as approximate date, the States began to militarize themselves. Inside the plan of militarization of the Spanish State, the fascistization is a consequence of this. Therefore, a bigger presence of the fascism is not because of a electoral success. Is quite the opposite: the electoral success of reactionary forces and fascists is because of the fascism and the reaction being more present in the society, consequence of this militarization and fascistization of the States (and, in this case, of the Spanish State).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – There will be not more or less repression to the working class movement depending on the turn government, or at least, because of the decision of the party in the government. In other words, the bigger or smaller repression is because of the plans of the financial oligarchy, and not because of the plans of the bourgeois leader of turn. During the last years of progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, we have suffered repression in the general strike of the metal in Cadiz and Vigo; the imprisonment of the political prisoner Pablo Hasel; there have not repeal the “Ley Mordaza” [Translator’s note: the main repressive law in Spanish State, which the social-democrats promised to repeal]; they have been committed the genocide against the African masses in Melilla; they have committed thousands and thousands of evictions; they have infiltrated national policemen inside the social and political movements, etc.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     3. Why is useless to vote the less bad option?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because the less bad option is not any option. Vote to PP, PSOE, Vox or Sumar doesn’t change anything, all of them are administrators of the financial capital. None of the parties of the parliament challenge nor the bourgeois order, neither the Spanish imperialist. During the last years of the progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, the life conditions of the working class became worst in all the aspects. We are gonna reward the administrators of the financial capital voting them again with the excuse of “stop the fascism” to allow them to worsen our life in the next years?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     –
    </em>
<em>
     Because vote the less bad option doesn’t protect civil, social or trade-unionist rights. Which rights we have recovered with the progresist government of coalitin between PSOE and Unidas Podemos? They have break up the union movement and have repressed the movements of the combative masses. The prices are increasing much more than wages. The alleged winning of rights for the proletarian woman and the LGTB collective is a ghost in a paper, meanwhile the hate crimes non stop their increase. What have done the government for the proletariat?”
    </em>
</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
     The Catalan proletariat must
    </strong>
<strong>
     struggle
    </strong>
<strong>
     side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat
    </strong>
</h2>
<p>
    The Catalan proletariat will be completely free not only when its national rights are respected, but when it is liberated as a social class. And that involves the destruction of the Spanish imperialist State, the old bourgeois State, and the generation of a new power, the new proletarian State. The Catalan proletariat cannot fight alone against the Spanish imperialist State. It must fight side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat as class brothers against the common enemy: the Spanish State, Spanish imperialism.
   </p>
<p>
    This titanic task involves the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Spain as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, mainly Maoist, Party with the universally valid contributions of Chairman Gonzalo. A militarized Party prepared to take political power with People’s War and with the perspective of shaping the dictatorship of the proletariat as a federal Socialist Republic where the proletariat of all nations struggle, as class brothers and ultimately, until communism.
   </p>
<p>
    Thus, and only thus, the Catalan proletariat will be free. And the first step cannot be other than delegitimate the electoral farce, discard illusions in bourgeois democracy and preparing for the battles that will come in the struggle against the Spanish State.

  PROTESTS met the arrival of Anthony Blinken, secretary of the US Department of State, in Malacañang on March 19. Blinken was in the country to meet with Ferdinand Marcos Jr and the AFP on the upcoming Balikatan wargames and to again push the Indo-Pacific Security Strategy, the US strategy to maintain its hegemony in Asia against its rival China.
 </p>
<p>
  Before Blinken, high-ranking US economic and military officials arrived in the country almost simultaneously this March.
 </p>
<p>
  Gina Raimondo, US department of commerce secretary, led the Presidential Trade and Investment Mission delegation sent by the US government to peddle the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a key part of the Indo-Pacific Security Strategy. Raimondo’s delegation included 22 heads of large American companies, including two construction companies (Bechtel, Black &amp; Veatch) that build US naval bases and military facilities in various countries.
 </p>
<p>
  Adm. John C. Aquilino, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, also arrived in the Philippines for meetings with Marcos, defense secretary Gilbert Teodoro and AFP chief Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, along with other senior AFP officials.
 </p>
<p>
  They discussed preparations for Balikatan 2024, heralded to be the “biggest” in its history. It will be launched in Batanes and Palawan from April 22 to May 8. One of its “highlights” is the “integrated air missile defense exercise,” or missiles flying in the direction of China. This is in accordance with the Strategic Defense Strategy and the Philippine role as bait in the first-island chain defense of the US.

<div class="article__content">
<p>
  This March, three big bourgeoisie-compradors announced their “merger” for the operation of the Ilijan LNG terminal, the first “integrated LNG import facility” built by the Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Company (AG&amp;P) along the coast of Barangay Ilijan, Batangas. City. Meralco PowerGen, Aboitiz Power and San Miguel Global Power (SMGP) converged to buy the said facility for $3.3 billion (₱184 billion).
 </p>
<p>
  The Ilijan LNG terminal covers nine hectares of land and up to 700 meters of the sea from the coast for a “floating storage” of LNG (liquefied natural gas). Apart from the port and storage, it will also serve as a facility for “regasification” (the process of transforming LNG from its liquid form to its original gas form). The facility will supply natural gas to the San Miguel Corporation (SMC)-owned giant power plant being constructed.
 </p>
<p>
  This facility and plant is among the 12 “terminals” and 35 new energy plants planned to be built to handle imported LNG and diesel. Seven of the terminals and eight of the new plants are slated to be built along the Batangas coast, in front of the Verde Island Passage (VIP). Others will be built in Leyte, Navotas City and Zamboanga. One of the LNG plants, planned to be built along the Tañon Strait in San Carlos, Negros Occidental, was temporarily blocked by protesting residents, churchgoers and environmental groups. Many of the LNG projects are championed by the SMC, in partnership with Japanese, American and British multinational institutions and banks.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, there are six LNG plants operating in the country, and five of them lie along the Batangas coast.
 </p>
<h2>
  Dumping US surplus LNG
 </h2>
<p>
  The Philippines opened LNG imports from 2021 amid the reported imminent exhaustion of natural gas reserves in the Malampaya gas fields by 2027. The US used this opportunity to push the country to import LNG.
 </p>
<p>
  The US has been the world’s leading producer of LNG since 2011. It surpassed Russia, Australia and Qatar to become the number one exporter for the first time in December 2023. This is mainly due to the US seizure of Western Europe (Germany, France, UK, and others) markets for LNG that used to flow through Russian pipes. In addition to the US imposing sanctions against the purchase of LNG from Russia since the Ukraine war broke out, it blew up the Nordstream pipeline to prevent the smuggling of LNG. LNG terminals had to be built to store the LNG from the US that is being transported to Western Europe on large tankers.
 </p>
<p>
  As a direct result of the US proxy war with Ukraine, LNG prices have skyrocketed to $40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) by 2022. However, US LNG overproduction has dragged the global market price down to $9.80 per mmBtu in 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  The US is now desperate to open new markets and monopolize old markets in Asia to dump its LNG surplus and keep demand and prices high. American companies such as ExxonMobil, Novatek and Chevron are most interested in importing LNG.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the price of LNG in the international market has dropped, it is only temporary and does not mean lower electricity bills in the Philippines. In 2023, imported LNG was $1-$3/mmBtu more expensive than domestic natural gas. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis estimates that the price of energy produced from imported LNG is around ₱9 per kilowatt hour (kwh) to ₱16/kwh. This is higher than the average ₱7.38/kwh energy produced using the similarly imported coal and diesel in 2023, and ₱4.4/kwh using local solar power.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite definitely higher charges, the Department of Energy still required all distributors to source electricity from plants using imported LNG. According to the “energy map” of the Marcos regime, the Philippines will increase the use of imported LNG and “renewable” energies from 29% (of which 13% is LNG) to 35% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.
 </p>
<h2>
  Threat to the VIP and livelihood of fisherfolks
  <h2>
<p>
    LNG is marketed as a “transition fuel” being supposedly cleaner compared to coal and diesel. However, it still creates greenhouse gases (GHG) such as methane, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. In fact, studies show that the methane it produces is more harmful to the environment, because it is more potent in trapping heat in the atmosphere by 80-100 times longer than carbon dioxide.
   </p>
<p>
    Construction of the Ilijan LNG terminal started at the height of the pandemic (2021) and completed in 2023. It was built by AG&amp;P, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, in partnership with Osaka Gas and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. In February, American company Nebula Energy bought AG&amp;P’s LNG-focused division.
   </p>
<p>
    In concurrence with the Ilijan LNG terminal, SMGP is now building the Batangas Combine Cycle Power Plant in Sta. Rita, Batangas. Although separate projects, the two facilities are connected and face the same side of the VIP.
   </p>
<p>
    Environmental group’s study show the two facilities, and others similar projects, threaten the VIP ecosystem that scientists consider the “richest marine habitat” in the world. During construction alone, sediment and sand already affect the seas beyond the scope of the facility. Construction disruptred the cycle and habitat of fish and other marine life not only in its immediate area, but throughout the entire VIP. This has resulted in a further decline in the quality of coral reefs and a decline in the catch of fisherfolks.
   </p>
<p>
    Aside from damaging the sea, AG&amp;P also faces a case of illegal conversion of agricultural lands in the barangays of Ilijan and De La Paz. It also has cases of illegal cutting of coconut trees in the area. In fact, the Department of Agriculture issued a “cease and desist order” against the company last year due to its lack of a land conversion permit. AG&amp;P and the Japanese banks ignored the order.
   </p>
<p>
    Hundreds of fisherfolks in Batangas have long been affected by the operations of the First Gen and SMC power plants. Before the new plants and facilities began construction, their last fish (tulingan and galunggong) catches have been halved since 2019. They were further constricted when fishing was banned from the shores near the construction.
   </p>
<p>
    In addition, residents fear the possible leakage of LNG into the ocean, more so because the VIP is vulnerable to strong and severe typhoons. VIP has not yet recovered, and may never recover, from the damage caused by the oil spill from the SMC-chartered vessel, the MT Princess Empress, last year.
   </p>
<p>
    Batangas air and water will become even more polluted once the coast is peppered with dirty energy plants. Marine life will also be more disturbed by increased traffic of imported LNG delivery ships.
   </p>
<p>
    Many coastal communities will lose their source of livelihood and even their homes. As many as two million Filipinos directly depend on the VIP for their livelihood.
   </p>

<p>
  The total cost of damage brought by the El Niño drought to the agricultural sector in Negros Occidental has reached ₱78.45 million. The province is in Western Visayas, one of the regions that is presently experiencing the brunt of El Niño. The drought severely affected eleven (three cities and eight towns) out of its total of 32 municipalities. Thousands of families now suffer from hunger and lack of potable water.
 </p>
<p>
  Amid the negligence of the local government and the US-Marcos regime, coupled with relentless militarization, the peasant masses have no choice but to unite to collectively face the drought calamity.
 </p>
<h2>
  Demand for government accountability
 </h2>
<p>
  Farmers’ organizations are planning coordinated and level-by-level mass campaigns in Negros Occidental to address El Niño. They started consultations, meetings and study campaigns at the barangay level, and they aim to expand it to town and district levels. They prepare a petition stating their call to the government for adequate aid, food and subsidies for their production.
 </p>
<p>
  Masses of farmers in the province now face the destruction of their crops. In Negros Occidental, only 41,140 hectares out of 94,297 hectares are irrigated, which is also affected by the drought. A farmer relates, “we skipped the 3rd cropping of rice since we only depended on rain for irrigation.”
 </p>
<p>
  This prompted others to plan planting corn instead to supplement their food needs. Nevertheless, they can only begin planting when the rains come. Others planted vegetables and now exert extra effort to fetch water from distant wells to water them. “Sources have run out, even small rivers have no water,” said another.
 </p>
<p>
  Only 67% of the government’s target to develop irrigation nationwide was implemented last year. Many canals are already useless, have been repurposed and are completely destroyed. Irrigation water from dams is also greatly reduced because most is allocated to the electricity industry and services.
 </p>
<p>
  Even their animals are affected. Carabaos, cows, goats, and other domestic animals have run out of pasture lands because the grass is dry and they have nothing to eat. Some animals have died because of the extreme heat.
 </p>
<p>
  El Niño affects not only livelihood, but also the health of the residents. The extreme heat has resulted in an epidemic of cough, fever, cold and other illnesses. Cases of stroke, increased blood pressure, and fatigue have also been recorded in some areas.
 </p>
<p>
  Amid all this, farmers were extremely insulted by the meager ₱2,500 aid the local government have distributed to farmers owning three hectares of rice fields. They say the ₱15 million fund to buy pumps and equipment for irrigation was also released very late and was all for show.
 </p>
<p>
  They insist that given no significant help, they are ready to act united for a dialogue and confrontation with local agencies.
 </p>
<h2>

<p>
  To support production, farmers revived

  </em>
  , the traditional form of agricultural cooperation in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  In the southern part of Negros Occidental, they set to communally cultivate an area of land they acquired through a successful campaign. They agreed to plant corn on the land. “This is the primary aspect of the cooperation…we follow the framework of “work points,” shared the participating farmer. They agreed that the women’s group will water the corn fields nightly.
 </p>
<p>
  Their unity and alliance work with the middle forces in the community also bore fruit. They said the hoses they got as support were a big help. They use this for irrigation especially with distant water sources.
 </p>
<p>
  “Our cooperation further improved most especially during El Niño…especially our work in the kampo (cane fields) is also about to end,” according to a farmer. This will also help, he said, with food sources this dry season. At times like these, a farmer even attested, “we have nothing else to rely on but our cooperation.”
