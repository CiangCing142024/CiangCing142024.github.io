 <p>
  On the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March a combative and anti-imperialist contingent took part to the demonstration organized by Fosse aux Lyons and CFP. This contingent expressed their support to the heroic Palestinian national resistance and especially the women of Gaza. The protesters carried a banner with the slogans “Support for our sisters in Gaza who fight against imperialism and patriarchy! Palestine will win!” and shouted slogans in support of armed struggle, against Zionism and imperialism. Several speeches took a stance against US imperialism and Zionism, and also French imperialism and its treatment of the Mahorese women was condemned. Nouvelle Epoque reports that the contingent was well received among the masses.

  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-mulheres-camponesas-celebram-8-de-marco-na-zona-da-mata-sul/">
   session
  </a>
  celebrating the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March. The panel was attended by women representatives of the League of Poor Peasants of the Northeast (LCP-NE), a representative of the Committee for the Defense of the Agrarian Revolution (CDRA) of the José Ricardo Revolutionary Area and a teacher from the Elizabete Teixeira People’s School. During the event, a daycare service was organized in order to allow peasant mothers to take part. Following the Internationale, the principles of the People’s Women’s Movement were presented and there was reading and discussion about the origin of the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, a part of the MFP bulletin. At the end, it was discussed and defined how women could increase their participation in the struggle to recover water sources and land from the old Frei Caneca plantation. In this way, the plenary session led the formation of an agitation and propaganda committee to recover water sources and organize a daycare service so that women can actively participate in recovering the land. The session ended with the Anthem of the Revolutionary Fighters and many slogans from the warriors of the southern forest of Pernambuco.

  As we reported earlier, a massive and combative demonstration
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/15/colombia-successful-day-of-mobilization-for-march-8/">
   took place
  </a>
  on the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March in Medellin,
  <strong>
   Colombia
  </strong>
  . The struggle of the women who took part
  <a href="https://nuevademocracia.com.co/?p=26117">
   has been criminalized
  </a>
  by members of the ruling classes, with posters published accusing some of the women of vandalism, as well as intimidation and detention carried out by the police against women for such reasons as wearing green or purple scarves. Now women’s organizations are denouncing that the old State is quick to repress the protest of women but don’t punish the murderers and rapists of women. Posters have been put up and slogans have been painted by revolutionary women condemning the criminalization of protest.
