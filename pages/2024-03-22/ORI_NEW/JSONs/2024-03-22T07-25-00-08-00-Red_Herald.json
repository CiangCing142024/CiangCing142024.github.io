During the event, a daycare service was organized in order to allow peasant mothers to take part. Following the Internationale, the principles of the People\u2019s Women\u2019s Movement were presented and there was reading and discussion about the origin of the 8\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  of March, a part of the MFP bulletin. At the end, it was discussed and defined how women could increase their participation in the struggle to recover water sources and land from the old Frei Caneca plantation. In this way, the plenary session led the formation of an agitation and propaganda committee to recover water sources and organize a daycare service so that women can actively participate in recovering the land. The session ended with the Anthem of the Revolutionary Fighters and many slogans from the warriors of the southern forest of Pernambuco.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10152\" data-id=\"10152\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-1.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-1.webp\" width=\"640\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10153\" data-id=\"10153\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-2.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-2.webp\" width=\"640\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10154\" data-id=\"10154\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-3.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-3.webp\" width=\"640\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10155\" data-id=\"10155\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-4.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pernambuco-4.webp\" width=\"640\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">\n   Peasant women organized a plenary session in Zona da Mata Sul in Pernambuco, Brazil.
