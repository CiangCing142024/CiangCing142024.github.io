  Έχουμε μπει πια στον έκτο μήνα της γενοκτονικής σφαγής του σιωνιστικού κράτους του Ισραήλ ενάντια στον λαό της Παλαιστίνης στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Οι ασταμάτητοι καθημερινοί βομβαρδισμοί μετατρέπουν την περιοχή σε ερείπια γεμάτα από δολοφονημένους αμάχους, ενώ εγκρίθηκε από το πολεμικό συμβούλιο του Ισραήλ και η εισβολή στη Ράφα. Ταυτόχρονα, το Ισραήλ χρησιμοποιεί την πείνα σαν όπλο ενάντια στον παλαιστινιακό λαό, αλλά και όπως επισημαίνουν αρκετοί αναλυτές, σαν εργαλείο πίεσης στις διαπραγματεύσεις με τη Χαμάς. Στην ίδια κατεύθυνση -της πίεσης- χρησιμοποιούν οι σιωνιστές και την απειλή της εισβολής στη Ράφα, που πάντως απηχεί συνάμα και τη βούληση της ακραίας αντιδραστικής ομάδας σιωνιστών που κυβερνά το Ισραήλ και που έχει ενσωματώσει στις πολιτικές της τις πρακτικές των Γερμανών Ναζί.
 </p>
<p>
  Μάξιμουμ στόχος των σιωνιστών, η χρησιμοποίηση της γενοκτονικής πολιτικής σαν μέσο για τον μαζικό εκτοπισμό των Παλαιστινίων από τη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Αυτός ο στόχος, παρά τα δεινά του παλαιστινιακού λαού, δεν είναι καθόλου εύκολα επιτεύξιμος, όχι κυρίως γιατί βρίσκει τα αντιδραστικά αραβικά καθεστώτα απέναντι για να «μην φορτωθούν το πρόβλημα». Αλλά γιατί ο λαός της Γάζας αρνείται επίμονα και με γενναιότητα να εγκαταλείψει τον τόπο που ζει και να γίνει για δεύτερη φορά πρόσφυγας.
 </p>
<p>
  Μίνιμουμ στόχος, η δημιουργία προϋποθέσεων για κατατεμαχισμό της Λωρίδας της Γάζας σε στρατιωτικά επιτηρούμενες περιοχές στα πρότυπα των γκέτο που έχουν δημιουργήσει στη Δυτική Όχθη (που με τη σειρά τους είναι μια, εξελιγμένη και αναβαθμισμένη σε βαρβαρότητα, αντιγραφή των εβραϊκών γκέτο που έφτιαξαν οι ναζί). Θεωρούν ότι έτσι θα μπορέσουν να υλοποιήσουν μια έστω πιο αργόσυρτη διαδικασία εκτοπισμού του παλαιστινιακού λαού από τη γη του. Άλλωστε, αυτή η διαδικασία συμβαίνει σε ενεστώτα χρόνο στην, κομματιασμένη σε ασφυκτικά επιτηρούμενες περιοχές από τις προδοτικές συμφωνίες του Όσλο, Δυτική Όχθη. Για του λόγου το αληθές, ο ρυθμός δημιουργίας νέων σπιτιών εποίκων στην παλαιστινιακή γη έχει εκτοξευθεί          : από τον Οκτώβριο του 2022 έως τον Οκτώβριο του 2023, καταγράφηκαν 24.500 νέες οικιστικές μονάδες εποίκων. Παράλληλα, φαίνεται πως για παν ενδεχόμενο οι σιωνιστές έχουν προσεγγίσει φατρίες μέσα στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας, για να διαμορφώσουν, όπως πριν το 2005, ένα δίκτυο δωσίλογων, μέσω των οποίων να εμπεδώνουν την ισραηλινή κατοχή στην περιοχή.

<strong>
   ΗΠΑ: εμπλοκή και στοχεύσεις
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Ο υπότιτλος δεν αναφέρεται στην εμπλοκή των ΗΠΑ στη σφαγή που εξελίσσεται μέσω της συνεχιζόμενης και μαζικής τροφοδοσίας με κάθε φονικό σιδερικό προς το σιωνιστικό Ισραήλ. Αυτή συνεχίζεται και θα συνεχιστεί και μάλλον αποτελούν μοχλό πίεσης οι φήμες πως ενδέχεται οι ΗΠΑ να σταματήσουν τη στρατιωτική βοήθεια προς το Τελ Αβίβ.
 </p>
<p>
  Ο αμερικανικός ιμπεριαλισμός, βλέποντας να διακυβεύονται τα στρατηγικά του συμφέροντα στη Μέση Ανατολή από την πολιτική Νετανιάχου, παράλληλα με τη στήριξη που παρέχει στους σιωνιστές, έχει το τελευταίο διάστημα εμπλακεί εντείνοντας ξανά την πίεση και τους εκβιασμούς στη σιωνιστική ηγεσία. Μετά τις αλλεπάλληλες δηλώσεις ή «διαρροές» με ανοιχτά μικρόφωνα του Μπάιντεν και του Μπλίνκεν, ήρθε ο επικεφαλής των Δημοκρατικών και πρόεδρος της αμερικανικής Γερουσίας, Τζακ Σούμερ, να δηλώσει πως το Ισραήλ πρέπει να πάει σε εκλογές και να αντικατασταθεί ο Νετανιάχου, μιας και αποτελεί εμπόδιο για την ειρήνη. Ο ίδιος ο Σούμερ, όπως και συνολικά η αμερικανική κυβέρνηση, απαίτησαν παράλληλα μια «νέα» Παλαιστινιακή Αρχή. Μάλιστα, ο ανεκδιήγητος Μαχμούντ Αμπάς έσπευσε αμέσως να υπακούσει στις αμερικανικές προσταγές, αλλάζοντας τον πρωθυπουργό της ΠΑ με έναν γνωστό για τις διασυνδέσεις του με τις ΗΠΑ και πρώην στέλεχος της Παγκόσμιας Τράπεζας. Γι’ αυτό και πολύ σωστά, σημαντικές παλαιστινιακές οργανώσεις (Χαμάς, ισλαμική Τζιχάντ, Λαϊκό Μέτωπο για την Απελευθέρωση της Παλαιστίνης, Κίνημα Εθνικής Πρωτοβουλίας) κατήγγειλαν απερίφραστα «τα νέα προδοτικά κόλπα» του Αμπάς, την στιγμή που «
  <em>
   η ύψιστη εθνική προτεραιότητα τώρα είναι η αντιμετώπιση της βάρβαρης σιωνιστικής επιθετικότητας και του γενοκτονικού και λιμοκτονικού πολέμου της Κατοχής ενάντια στον λαό μας στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας και η αντιμετώπιση των εγκλημάτων των εποίκων της στη Δυτική Όχθη και την υπό κατοχή Αλ-Κουντς (σ.σ. Ιερουσαλήμ) -ιδιαίτερα στο Τέμενος Αλ-Ακσα- και των σημαντικών κινδύνων που αντιμετωπίζει η εθνική μας υπόθεση -στην πρώτη γραμμή των οποίων βρίσκεται ο εξελισσόμενος κίνδυνος του εκτοπισμού
  </em>
  ».
 </p>
<p>
  Οι Αμερικάνοι φαίνεται ότι θα ήθελαν με μια διπλή αντικατάσταση (κυβέρνησης Ισραήλ, Παλαιστινιακής Αρχής) να αναστήσουν το σχέδιο ενός κράτους Μπαντουστάν για τους Παλαιστίνιους, προτεκτοράτο του Ισραήλ, των αραβικών καθεστώτων και φυσικά δικό τους και σε δεύτερο χρόνο να ανοίξουν τον δρόμο για την επαναφορά σε πρώτο πλάνο της προσέγγισης Ισραήλ-Αραβικών καθεστώτων, με στόχο το Ιράν και στο βάθος τη Ρωσία και την Κίνα.
 </p>
<p>
  Επιπλέον, αδίστακτοι καθώς είναι, χρησιμοποιούν και την «ανθρωπιστική βοήθεια» για να αποκτήσουν μεταφορικά και κυριολεκτικά άμεση πρόσβαση στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Με την ελληνοκυπριακή ηγεσία, διπλά δουλική σε ΗΠΑ και Ισραήλ και ακολουθώντας πιστά την άρχουσα τάξη της χώρας μας, να έχει μετατρέψει την Κύπρο σε ξέφραγο αμπέλι των σιωνιστών και ταυτόχρονα να βάζει πλάτη στους αμερικανικούς σχεδιασμούς για την παρουσία τους στην περιοχή. Ας σημειώσουμε εδώ ότι μέσω της επιχείρησης «Αμάλθειας» μεταφέρθηκαν στη Λωρίδα μόλις 200 τόνοι τρόφιμα, όσα δηλαδή μπορούν να μεταφέρουν 10 φορτηγά από την ξηρά, την ίδια στιγμή που το Ισραήλ αρνείται την είσοδο στη Λωρίδα εκατοντάδων φορτηγών από το πέρασμα της Ράφα.
 </p>
<p>
  Ταυτόχρονα και παράλληλα με τα προηγούμενα, οι ΗΠΑ πιέζουν ασφυκτικά τη σιωνιστική ηγεσία να γυρίσει στο τραπέζι των διαπραγματεύσεων, μιας και είναι αυτή που συνεχώς τις τορπιλίζει. Έτσι, η πίεση των ΗΠΑ αλλά και οι σοβαρές αντιθέσεις στο εσωτερικό του πολεμικού συμβουλίου και της σιωνιστικής κυβέρνησης, λόγω του βαλτώματος της στρατιωτικής εισβολής, είχαν σαν αποτέλεσμα η σιωνιστική διαπραγματευτική ομάδα να γυρίσει στην Ντόχα την περασμένη Τρίτη 19/3. Όσον αφορά τις διαπραγματεύσεις, η πλευρά της Χαμάς, που βρίσκεται σε συνεννόηση με όλες τις αντιστασιακές παλαιστινιακές οργανώσεις, αρνείται, και σωστά, την απελευθέρωση όλων των ομήρων, διότι αυτό απλά θα σήμαινε την αποθράσυνση των σιωνιστών. Από την πλευρά της, και σωστά, θέτει ως βασικό (και ίσως μάξιμουμ) όρο την επίτευξη μιας μόνιμης κατάπαυσης του πυρός, την αποχώρηση των στρατευμάτων κατοχής από τη Λωρίδα και από κει και πέρα την ελευθερία στον λαό της Λωρίδας να γυρίσει στον τόπο του και φυσικά την έναρξη μια διαδικασίας αποκατάστασης όλων των υποδομών και τελικά της ζωής στην πολύπαθη και ματωμένη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Το πώς ακριβώς θα προχωρήσουν οι εξελίξεις μένει να το δούμε.

   La actividad se desarrolló en conjunto con la comunidad y diputados del Frente Chaqueño, donde los legisladores Pía Chiacchio Cavanna y Rodolfo Schwartz propusieron debatir el proyecto de su autoría, de ley N°448/24 «De Emergencia y Soberanía Alimentaria», y recibir ideas, modificaciones y propuestas para su conversión en ley.
  </p>
<p>
   El evento contó con la presencia de los Diputados Provinciales Mariela Quirós, Analía Flores, Gladys González y Rodrigo Ocampo, así como con la participación comunitaria de productores rurales del Gran Resistencia, docentes, representantes de organizaciones sociales, clubes, cocineras de comedores y merenderos, iglesias, entre otros.
  </p>
<p>
   Durante la jornada se explicó brevemente en qué consiste el Proyecto de Ley y se debatió la situación crítica que atraviesa nuestra provincia como consecuencia de las políticas de ajuste aplicadas por el Gobierno Nacional, lo que ha exacerbado el hambre, especialmente en los sectores más vulnerables del Chaco.
  </p>
<p>
   La Diputada Pía Chiacchio Cavanna detalló un informe pormenorizado sobre la asistencia social brindada por el gobierno anterior, que benefició a más de trescientas mil familias con diferentes dispositivos, mediante programas nacionales y provinciales, desde comedores escolares hasta asistencia alimentaria para familias con celiaquía, entre otros, los cuales han dejado de recibir desde el 10 de diciembre pasado.
  </p>
<p>
   Por su parte, el Diputado Rodolfo Schwartz explicó que el proyecto busca fortalecer la producción y comercialización provincial de alimentos de Pequeños y Medianos Productores y Comerciantes, para abastecer a los comedores escolares y comunitarios, e incluir una política de Precios Acordados accesibles para la población.
  </p>
<p>
   Durante el Foro, se escucharon las diversas expresiones del centro de jubilados, representantes de organizaciones sociales, y delegados de la CGT y trabajadores de Empresas Recuperadas. Sus testimonios resaltaron la urgencia de cambiar la situación actual.
  </p>
<p>
   El Primer “Foro por la Emergencia Alimentaria” se había realizado una semana atrás, en General San Martín. Los diputados y diputadas planean recorrer la provincia para recoger necesidades, aportes y propuestas para la aprobación del proyecto en la Legislatura Chaqueña.

  Η υπουργός Παιδείας της Γερμανίας δηλώνει ότι τα σχολεία οφείλουν να προετοιμάσουν τους μαθητές για το ενδεχόμενο πολέμου, την ίδια στιγμή που το ντόπιο αστικό πολιτικό σύστημα χορεύει στον ρυθμό της ευρωκάλπης του Ιουνίου. Ο πρόεδρος του Ευρωπαϊκού Συμβουλίου, Σαρλ Μισέλ, διακηρύσσει ότι «αν θέλει ειρήνη, η Ευρώπη πρέπει να ετοιμαστεί για πόλεμο» και πως χρειάζεται να «περάσουμε σε λειτουργία οικονομίας πολέμου», ενώ, παράλληλα, τα ξέφτια των πάλαι ποτέ κραταιών αυταπατών και ψεμάτων για την «Ευρώπη των λαών» επιστρατεύονται ξανά από τους κυρίαρχους για να σύρουν τους λαούς τους στην επερχόμενη εκλογική φάρσα. Έτσι και εδώ, ο εγχώριος αστισμός ετοιμάζεται να φορέσει τα «δημοκρατικά» του κουστούμια, την ίδια ώρα που κάνει σχέδια για να ντύσει τον κόσμο της δουλειάς και τη νεολαία στις παραλλαγές, όποτε αυτό απαιτηθεί.
 </p>
<p>
  Γιατί εκεί ακριβώς οδηγεί η αναβάθμιση της εμπλοκής της χώρας στις εστίες αντιπαράθεσης που έχει ανάψει η παρόξυνση του ιμπεριαλιστικού ανταγωνισμού των ΗΠΑ-Δύσης με τη Ρωσία, αλλά και την Κίνα! Η συνάντηση του Μητσοτάκη με τον Ζελένσκι στην Οδησσό, κατά παραγγελία των Αμερικάνων και σε αναζήτηση ρόλων για λογαριασμό της ντόπιας άρχουσας τάξης σε πεδία που ήδη έχει κατοχυρώσει συμμετοχή η ανταγωνίστρια τουρκική, σημαδεύτηκε από τη «συμπτωματική» ρωσική πυραυλική επιδρομή μερικές εκατοντάδες μέτρα πιο δίπλα. Και οι προειδοποιητικές αναφορές του ρωσικού υπουργείου Εξωτερικών προς την Ελλάδα, που ακολούθησαν, αποτέλεσαν μια υπενθύμιση για το μέγεθος των κινδύνων που προκύπτουν από το γεγονός ότι η χώρα μετατρέπεται σε εν δυνάμει «στόχο» στο πλαίσιο της ενδοϊμπεριαλιστικής διαπάλης. Το ίδιο ισχύει και σε σχέση με την όλο και βαθύτερη ένταξη στο μέτωπο της Μέσης Ανατολής, με τη φρεγάτα «Ύδρα» να αναλαμβάνει ενεργό στρατιωτικό ρόλο στην Ερυθρά Θάλασσα στο πλαίσιο της «ευρωπαϊκής» αποστολής Aspides, κόντρα στα drones των Χούθι και προς στήριξη της σιωνιστικής γενοκτονίας του παλαιστινιακού λαού.
 </p>
<p>
  «Ευρωπαϊκής» και όχι γνήσια ευρωπαϊκής, μιας και είναι γνωστό το πόσο διχασμένη εμφανίστηκε η ΕΕ μπροστά στην πρωτοβουλία του αμερικάνικου ιμπεριαλισμού να ενισχύσει τη στρατιωτική του παρουσία στην Ερυθρά Θάλασσα με την επιχείρηση Prosperity Guardian. Αυτός ο διχασμός καταγράφηκε και στην πρόσφατη σύνοδο κορυφής, που επί της ουσίας είχε ως βασικό αντικείμενο το πώς θα σταθούν οι Ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές σε μια σειρά από μέτωπα, δεδομένης της αδυναμίας τους να κινηθούν ανεξάρτητα από τους συμμάχους-ανταγωνιστές τους στις ΗΠΑ, αλλά και των κενών και αντιφάσεων που έχει παρουσιάσει το τελευταίο διάστημα η πολιτική των τελευταίων. Έτσι, για άλλη μια φορά, όπως αποτυπώθηκε στην αντιπαράθεση Γαλλίας-Γερμανίας για την πρόταση έκδοσης ευρωομολόγου της τελευταίας, με την οποία έσπευσε να συνταχθεί και ο Μητσοτάκης, τα φιλόδοξα στρατιωτικά και εξοπλιστικά σχέδια για «στρατηγική αυτονομία» της ΕΕ είναι πολύ αμφίβολο αν θα υπερβούν τις ιδιοτελείς φιλοδοξίες της κάθε ιμπεριαλιστικής δύναμης για τον εαυτό της! Το μόνο σίγουρο είναι ότι στη συζήτηση που έχει ανοίξει για τους «τρόπους χρηματοδότησης» των διαφόρων πολεμικών προγραμμάτων, στο στόχαστρο βρίσκονται τα συνήθη υποζύγια των λαών της Ευρώπης, και ιδιαίτερα των εξαρτημένων χωρών, που θα κληθούν να πληρώσουν το μάρμαρο.
 </p>
<p>
  Εξακολουθώντας να παραδέρνει στις αντιθέσεις και τα εγγενή αδιέξοδά του, επομένως, το ευρωπαϊκό ιμπεριαλιστικό οικοδόμημα βαδίζει προς την κάλπη για την ανάδειξη του διακοσμητικού του οργάνου, για να φτιασιδώσει ό,τι μπορεί από το αποκρουστικό του πρόσωπο, που έχει αποκαλυφθεί πλατιά. Με πύρινους λόγους για τη «δημοκρατία» και τη «συμμετοχή» ετοιμάζονται να εμφανιστούν οι ηγέτες των ιμπεριαλιστικών μητροπόλεων, που πριν από λίγο καιρό κατέβαζαν τον στρατό στους δρόμους ενάντια στις εξεγέρσεις των λαών τους και ποινικοποιούσαν κάθε έκφραση αλληλεγγύης προς τον ηρωικό παλαιστινιακό λαό. Οι πρωταγωνιστές των αντικομμουνιστικών μνημονίων και της εξίσωσης κομμουνισμού-ναζισμού, που θρέφουν ξανά τα πιο μαύρα σκοτάδια του παρελθόντος της ανθρώπινης ιστορίας, που έχουν κανονικοποιήσει τον φασισμό και τον πόλεμο στην καθημερινότητα των λαών τους, ετοιμάζονται να μιλήσουν για το «μέλλον». Κατά πόδας τους ακολουθούν και οι πολιτικοί εκπρόσωποι της ντόπιας κεφαλαιοκρατίας.
 </p>
<p>
  Τόσο η κυβέρνηση της ΝΔ όσο και τα υπόλοιπα αστικά κόμματα της αντιπολίτευσης, λοιπόν, παίρνουν θέσεις ενόψει των ευρωεκλογών. Δεν θα μπορούσε να γίνει διαφορετικά, μιας και πέρα από την ανάγκη ενσωμάτωσης του λαού στα ιμπεριαλιστικά ευρωπαϊκά ιδεώδη που καλούνται διαχρονικά να υπηρετήσουν, αντιλαμβάνονται, επίσης, ότι οφείλουν και τα ίδια να αποδείξουν την προσήλωσή τους και να δώσουν κάθε λογής διαπιστευτήρια στους Ευρωπαίους «προστάτες» τους, σε μια εποχή, μάλιστα, μεγάλης γεωπολιτικής αναταραχής και έντονων ανισορροπιών στις σχέσεις των τελευταίων με τον έτερο υπερατλαντικό πυλώνα του καθεστώτος της εξάρτησης της χώρας, τους Αμερικάνους ιμπεριαλιστές.
 </p>
<p>
  Τα αδιέξοδα που παράγονται από αυτή την κατάσταση, άλλωστε, είναι που εισπράττει η κυβέρνηση της ΝΔ, η οποία έχει εμφανίσει σοβαρά σημάδια κάμψης, παρά τη σαφή δημοσκοπική της υπεροχή έναντι των υπολοίπων. Έτσι, μετά το καταδικαστικό ψήφισμα του ευρωκοινοβουλίου, ήρθαν οι αποκαλύψεις για το σκάνδαλο Ασημακοπούλου με τις επακόλουθες καρατομήσεις κυβερνητικών στελεχών, καθώς και οι παρεμβάσεις της ευρωπαϊκής εισαγγελίας για τα Τέμπη. Από αυτή την άποψη μπορεί και να εξηγηθεί το πόσο «ευρύχωρη» θέλει να εμφανίζεται ξαφνικά η ευρωβουλή και οι επιτροπές της για μια σειρά από κοινωνικές διεκδικήσεις, είτε αυτές αφορούν την απαίτηση των συγγενών των θυμάτων του εγκλήματος στα Τέμπη για απόδοση δικαιοσύνης είτε τα αιτήματα των κατοίκων των Εξαρχείων ενάντια στην καταστροφή της γειτονιάς τους. Δεν είναι μόνο οι τόνοι υποκρισίας που από πάντα κουβαλούν τα δήθεν ευαίσθητα στελέχη των Βρυξελλών και του Στρασβούργου! Είναι η σημερινή φάση που θέτει ως αναγκαιότητα στους Ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές ξανά και ξανά να αμφισβητήσουν την επιλογή της ντόπιας άρχουσας τάξης να αποτελεί το πιο πιστό και καλό παιδί των Αμερικάνων στην περιοχή.
 </p>
<p>
  Γι’ αυτό, όσο συγκλονιστικό είναι το μεγαλείο ενός γονιού που έχει χάσει το παιδί του και αγωνίζεται για δικαίωση, τόσο ασυγχώρητη είναι η άθλια αξιοποίησή του στο πλαίσιο των ιμπεριαλιστικών αντιθέσεων ή της ανάγκης των ευρωπαϊκών αφεντικών να συνετίσουν τους υποτελείς τους! Ακόμα περισσότερο, είναι ολέθριες για την εργατική τάξη, τον λαό και τη νεολαία οι αυταπάτες που καλλιεργούνται το τελευταίο διάστημα από την αστική αντιπολίτευση του ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, του ΠΑΣΟΚ, της Νέας Αριστεράς και άλλων, αλλά και από δυνάμεις της ποικιλώνυμης αριστεράς, ότι η ΕΕ και το κοινοβούλιό της είναι περίπου ο «φύλακας άγγελος» των λαϊκών δικαιωμάτων, ότι θα τιμωρήσουμε την «κακιά» κυβέρνηση Μητσοτάκη απευθυνόμενοι στους «καλούς» Ευρωπαίους που μας προστατεύουν.
 </p>
<p>
  Φυσικά, άλλο που δεν θέλει η αριστερά της ήττας και της υποταγής! Με χαρακτηριστική την περίπτωση του ΚΚΕ, που σπεύδει να κλείσει τον αγώνα της νεολαίας για να φορέσει τις εκλογικές του γραβάτες, με το που τελείωσαν οι τοπικές εκλογές έστρεψε κατευθείαν το βλέμμα της εκεί και όλη της η δράση περιστρέφεται εδώ και μήνες γύρω από τη «μητέρα των μαχών». Κάποιες οργανώσεις έφτασαν, μάλιστα, να καταρτίζουν ευρωψηφοδέλτια εν μέσω φοιτητικού ξεσηκωμού! Όλοι τους, μπροστά στην εκλογική παραζάλη και τις αυταπάτες, τρέχουν για άλλη μια φορά να δώσουν τη νομιμοποίησή τους στην κάλπη της ιμπεριαλιστικής λυκοσυμμαχίας και να συνδράμουν στον αγώνα των κυρίαρχων ενάντια στην «επάρατη» αποχή!
 </p>
<p>
  Γιατί οι δυνάμεις του συστήματος της εξάρτησης και της εκμετάλλευσης γνωρίζουν πολύ καλά ότι στη σημερινή φάση βαδίζουν στο πυρακτωμένο έδαφος της κοινωνικής οργής και αγανάκτησης που ολοένα και διευρύνεται και επιδρά πολλαπλασιαστικά στους ήδη υπάρχοντες όρους αστάθειας του αστικού πολιτικού σκηνικού. Έτσι, στους τριγμούς που παράγει η γεωπολιτική θέση της αστικής «μας» τάξης, αλλά και, σε συνάρτηση με το προηγούμενο, στους κραδασμούς μια παραπαίουσας παραρτηματοποιημένης οικονομίας, που στέκεται αδύναμη μπροστά σε «εξωγενείς απειλές», σύμφωνα με πρόσφατη έκθεση της JP Morgan, θα προστίθενται διαρκώς τα δεδομένα που θα διαμορφώνει η οργή των «από κάτω».
 </p>
<p>
  Η μαζική αποδοκιμασία του πορίσματος συγκάλυψης της εξεταστικής επιτροπής για τα Τέμπη αυτό ακριβώς αποτυπώνει. Με τη φτώχεια και την εξαθλίωση να απλώνονται, με την καπιταλιστική ακρίβεια να έχει γονατίσει την κοινωνική πλειονότητα, με την κυβέρνηση να ανακοινώνει το τέλος των διαφόρων επιδομάτων και pass και την υποταγή στη «δημοσιονομική σταθερότητα», με τον λαό να εξορίζεται από τα νοσοκομεία και κάθε δυνατότητα πρόσβασης σε υγειονομική περίθαλψη, με την πολυαναμενόμενη αύξηση του κατώτατου μισθού να αποδεικνύεται κοροϊδία που ήδη έχει εξανεμιστεί, είναι σαφές ότι διαμορφώνονται κύματα δυσαρέσκειας στις λαϊκές μάζες, που κάθε άλλο παρά μπορούν να ελεγχθούν, όσο και αν πασχίζουν άπαντες να τα εγκλωβίσουν στην κάλπη και σε ανώδυνες ή και επικίνδυνες λύσεις.
 </p>
<p>
  Η βαναυσότητα των δυνάμεων καταστολής απέναντι στους φοιτητές που επιμένουν να κάνουν καταλήψεις ενάντια στον ψηφισμένο νόμο Πιερρακάκη, οι απειλές για φυλάκιση ενάντια στους «ατίθασους» εκπαιδευτικούς που αρνούνται την αξιολόγηση, αποδεικνύει ότι οι ιθύνοντες όλο και πιο συχνά θα καταφεύγουν «στον νόμο και την τάξη» για να ανακόψουν τις κοινωνικές διεργασίες που εξελίσσονται, γιατί πολύ απλά δεν έχουν άλλη επιλογή. «Μπροστά στον νόμο δεν επιτρέπεται ο δρόμος» είναι το μήνυμα που επιδιώκουν να στείλουν, γιατί αυτή η διέξοδος είναι που φοβούνται!
 </p>
<p>
  Αυτή τη διέξοδο οφείλουμε να ενισχύσουμε! Με συσπείρωση των δυνάμεων και των αγωνιστών που επιμένουν ότι τίποτα δεν τελείωσε, πως ο αγώνας για την ανατροπή του νόμου Πιερρακάκη πρέπει να συνεχιστεί, πως είναι υπαρκτή δυνατότητα το κοινό μέτωπο εργαζομένων και νεολαίας. Με τη συμπόρευση των τάσεων εκείνων που αρνούνται να παρέχουν νομιμοποίηση στο άθλιο κατασκεύασμα της ευρωκάλπης των ιμπεριαλιστών, βροντοφωνάζοντας παντού την επιλογή της ΑΠΟΧΗΣ από την εκλογική φάρσα, δείχνοντας τον δρόμο της πάλης των μαζών ενάντια στα δεσμά της ΕΕ και του ΝΑΤΟ. Για να υπηρετήσουμε, σε τελευταία ανάλυση, την προοπτική της αναμέτρησης της εργατικής τάξης, του λαού και της νεολαίας με το καθεστώς της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης, την προοπτική της επαναστατικής ανατροπής της εκμετάλλευσης και της κοινωνικής απελευθέρωσης!

<p>
  Μετά την ολοκλήρωση των εργασιών της Εξεταστικής Επιτροπής της Βουλής για το έγκλημα των Τεμπών, με βάση τη δημοσιότητα που είχε πάρει το ζήτημα των υπογραφών και με πρόσφατη τη μαύρη πρώτη επέτειο και την οργή του κόσμου που εκφράστηκε μαζικά στην απεργία στις 28 Φλεβάρη, το κλίμα βάραινε για την κυβέρνηση και δυσχέραινε την επιχείρηση συγκάλυψης.
 </p>
<p>
  Η κυβέρνηση, όπως ήταν αναμενόμενο, πέρασε στην αντεπίθεση και κινήθηκε σε δυο βασικούς άξονες: Πρώτον κατηγόρησε την αντιπολίτευση ότι εργαλειοποιεί την τραγωδία και χρησιμοποιεί τους νεκρούς και τον πόνο των συγγενών τους στην πολιτική της αντιπαράθεση με αυτήν (πολιτικές βδέλλες, τους χαρακτήρισε ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος Μαρινάκης). Και δεύτερον, παρουσιάστηκε ως η μόνη υπεύθυνη που θα μπορούσε πραγματικά να ικανοποιήσει το αίτημα των συγγενών, αλλά και όλου του λαού, για πλήρη διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης και τιμωρία των ενόχων με πραγματικά και αντικειμενικά στοιχεία.
 </p>
<p>
  Σε αυτές τις κατευθύνσεις κινήθηκε και ο ίδιος ο Μητσοτάκης στη συνέντευξή του στον ΣΚΑΪ. Παίρνοντας το γνωστό, προφανώς πολυδουλεμένο από το επικοινωνιακό επιτελείο του «ανθρώπινο» ύφος, είπε πως δεν ξέχασε τις εικόνες και τις μυρωδιές την άλλη μέρα, όταν πήγε στον τόπο του εγκλήματος, του οποίου το μπάζωμα επέβαλε η ανθρώπινη ανάγκη να στηριχθούν κάπου οι γερανοί για να σηκώσουν τα βαγόνια και να ανασυρθούν τα πτώματα. Η ανθρωπιά του εξαντλήθηκε κάπου εκεί, γιατί ήταν πολύ κυνικός όταν έλεγε ότι ο σιδηρόδρομος είναι όσο ασφαλής μπορεί να είναι, χωρίς να αποκλείει, στην πραγματικότητα, κι άλλους νεκρούς στο μέλλον…
 </p>
<p>
  Τις ίδιες κατευθύνσεις ακολούθησε, με σχετικά επιθετικούς τόνους, η κυβέρνηση στη συζήτηση στη Βουλή για το πόρισμα της Εξεταστικής, δηλαδή της ΝΔ! Ένα πόρισμα που δεν βρήκε άλλο υπεύθυνο παρά τον ανθρώπινο παράγοντα και …την κακιά την ώρα που τα ‘φερε και έγιναν απανωτά λάθη και παραλείψεις που οδήγησαν στη σύγκρουση.
 </p>
<p>
  Στην πραγματικότητα, η ΝΔ απευθύνθηκε σε όλο τον λαό. Γνωρίζει ότι το έγκλημα των Τεμπών έχει προκαλέσει την οργή του, η οποία έχει εκφραστεί επανειλημμένα στον δρόμο, σε πολύ μαζικές συγκεντρώσεις, αλλά ακόμα και στο ενάμισι εκατομμύριο υπογραφές, παρά τις ενστάσεις που έχουμε γι΄ αυτές.
 </p>
<p>
  Αυτό που την ανησυχεί, πολύ περισσότερο απ’ ό,τι θέλει να δείχνει, είναι ότι αυτή η οργή του κόσμου συσσωρεύεται και αφορά σχεδόν όλες τις πλευρές της ζωής του. Κάποιο απ’ όλα τα ζητήματα που ανοίγει καθημερινά η επίθεσή της στα δικαιώματα λαού και νεολαίας μπορεί να γίνει η σταγόνα που θα κάνει το ποτήρι να ξεχειλίσει, με απρόβλεπτες συνέπειες.
 </p>
<p>
  Έτσι, στο ζήτημα των Τεμπών θέλει να πετύχει δυο αντικρουόμενους στόχους: Να συγκαλύψει το έγκλημα, να απαλλάξει τους υπουργούς της, αλλά και την ίδια, από πολιτικές ευθύνες και να κατευνάσει την οργή και των συγγενών και του λαού. Και την πίτα ολάκερη και τον σκύλο χορτάτο, δηλαδή, κάτι που αν έχει ελπίδες να καταφέρει είναι μόνο λόγω της κυριαρχίας της στο αστικό πολιτικό σκηνικό και, κυρίως, λόγω της απουσίας ενός λαϊκού κινήματος τόσο μαζικού, διεκδικητικού και ανυποχώρητου που θα την αναγκάσει να κάνει πίσω.
 </p>
<p>
  Στη συζήτηση στη Βουλή, αυτή η υπεροχή της ήταν φανερή, όχι μόνο γιατί τόλμησε και πέρασε στην αντεπίθεση, αλλά και γιατί το «
  <em>
   Πυρ ομαδόν
  </em>
  » εναντίον της, που γράφτηκε στον τύπο, μάλλον δεν την άγγιξε καν. ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, ΠΑΣΟΚ, Νέα Αριστερά αλλά και Πλεύση Ελευθερίας βρέθηκαν πολύ μακριά από το να εκφράσουν το λαϊκό αίσθημα για τη συγκάλυψη. Και πώς θα μπορούσαν άλλωστε, τη στιγμή που όλοι έχουν να λογοδοτήσουν για όσα έκαναν ή δεν έκαναν όταν βρέθηκαν σε κυβερνητικές θέσεις, προετοιμάζοντας τον δρόμο που οδήγησε στο έγκλημα.
 </p>
<p>
  Όσο για το ΚΚΕ, υπερασπίστηκε την πρότασή του για τη συγκρότηση της Εξεταστικής Επιτροπής, η οποία υλοποιήθηκε, λέγοντας πως δεν είχε αυταπάτες γιατί γνώριζε τα όριά της, αλλά την αποτίμησε θετικά γιατί αποκαλύφθηκε η προσπάθεια συγκάλυψης, ήρθαν στο φως νέα στοιχεία, αλλά και τροφοδοτήθηκαν οι κινητοποιήσεις λαού και νεολαίας! Αν δεν ήταν η Εξεταστική θα είχε λιγότερο κόσμο η απεργία και οι συγκεντρώσεις στις 28 Φλεβάρη δηλαδή; Ξεδιάντροπη διαστρέβλωση της πραγματικότητας, με στόχους που δεν είναι της παρούσης…
 </p>
<p>
  Ωστόσο, πιέσεις ασκούνται στην κυβέρνηση από την πλευρά της ΕΕ, μετά την παρέμβαση της Ευρωπαϊκής Εισαγγελίας και της αμφισβήτησης της βουλευτικής ασυλίας και του νόμου περί ευθύνης υπουργών, η οποία άνοιξε και όλη τη συζήτηση για το αν η ευρωπαϊκή νομοθεσία υπερισχύει του σχετικού άρθρου 86 του Συντάγματος. Επίσης, μετά τις ομιλίες της Καρυστιανού στο Ευρωκοινοβούλιο, αποφασίστηκε να παραμείνουν σε λειτουργία οι αρμόδιες επιτροπές της ΕΕ για τον έλεγχο της δικαστικής διαδικασίας, η οποία, πάντως, προχωρά πολύ γρήγορα, για τα ελληνικά δεδομένα.
 </p>
<p>
  Το ερώτημα είναι προς τα πού. Οι πιέσεις από την ΕΕ δεν έχουν την …αγνή πρόθεση της απονομής δικαιοσύνης σε ένα κράτος-μέλος της που σε αυτόν τον τομέα πάσχει. Αλλά είναι κινήσεις στην πολιτική-γεωπολιτική σκακιέρα, με στόχο ένα κράτος-μέλος που όλο και περισσότερο προσδένεται στο άρμα του μεγάλου υπερατλαντικού συμμάχου και πάσχει στον τομέα της …αφοσίωσης στην Ένωση.
 </p>
<p>
  Σε κάθε περίπτωση, η πιο ουσιαστική πίεση που μπορεί να ασκηθεί στην κυβέρνηση είναι αυτή από τον λαό, μέσα από τις κινητοποιήσεις του. Γιατί όπως κάποια στιγμή είπε και η ίδια η Καρυστιανού, η δικαίωση θα είναι να μην ξανασυμβεί κάτι τέτοιο. Ό,τι κι αν σημαίνει αυτό, θα συμπληρώσουμε εμείς…

<p>
  Πριν από μερικές μέρες, καρκινοπαθής στο Ηράκλειο Κρήτης αυτοκτόνησε απ’ την απόγνωση που βίωνε στην προσπάθειά του να λάβει θεραπεία. Στο σημείωμα που άφησε αναφέρει ότι δεν μπορούσε ν’ αντέξει άλλο τους πόνους όσο περίμενε το φάρμακό του, που βρισκόταν σε έλλειψη. Οι συγγενείς του αποκάλυψαν και τη δίμηνη κόλαση απ’ τη μέρα της διάγνωσης, καθώς προσπαθούσε να βρει περίθαλψη. Να ολοκληρώσει τις διαγνωστικές εξετάσεις με δική του ευθύνη στον ιδιωτικό τομέα, να προγραμματίσει εξειδικευμένες εξετάσεις για τις οποίες θα έπρεπε να μεταβεί στην Αθήνα χωρίς να έχει την οικονομική δυνατότητα, ν’ αναζητήσει και να προμηθευτεί ο ίδιος το φάρμακό του και να κλείσει το ραντεβού στο νοσοκομείο για να γίνουν οι χημειοθεραπείες. Αποτέλεσμα αυτών η τουλάχιστον δίμηνη καθυστέρηση, με αποτέλεσμα τον διπλασιασμό του όγκου και τους αφόρητους πόνους. Απέναντι σ’ όλα αυτά, ο υπουργός Υγείας Γεωργιάδης βρήκε το πρόβλημα στην ατομική ευθύνη του ασθενή που δεν πήγε στο ραντεβού, το οποίο είχε αρχικά ακυρωθεί λόγω της έλλειψης του φαρμάκου.
 </p>
<p>
  Η περίπτωση του εκλιπόντος δεν είναι μοναδική. Τουναντίον, είναι η συνήθης και περιγράφει την κανονικότητα που υφίσταται ο λαός ως αποτέλεσμα της χρόνιας επίθεσης του συστήματος στο λαϊκό δικαίωμα σε ίση, πλήρη και δωρεάν περίθαλψη. Ο πρωθυπουργός Κυρ. Μητσοτάκης υπερηφανεύεται για την αναβάθμιση του ΕΣΥ διαφημίζοντας την απορρόφηση κονδυλίων απ’ το Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης για την ανακαίνιση κτιρίων, ενώ ο υπουργός Γεωργιάδης φωτογραφίζεται με τον πρώτο ασθενή που θα χειρουργηθεί σε απογευματινό επί πληρωμή χειρουργείο. Μάλιστα ο Γεωργιάδης υποστηρίζει ότι μόνο το 1% διαφωνεί με τα επί πληρωμή χειρουργεία και οι υπόλοιποι υγειονομικοί και λαός το περίμεναν εδώ και δεκαετίες!
 </p>
<p>
  Δεν πρόκειται για μία προσπάθεια μετατροπής του άσπρου σε μαύρο. Η πραγματικότητα είναι αμείλικτη κι ο λαός δεν μασάει κουτόχορτο. Γνωρίζουν ωστόσο τα όρια της πολιτικής υποταγής των συνδικαλιστικών ηγεσιών και των ρεφορμιστικών δυνάμεων και έχουν ζυγίσει την αντίδραση των «από κάτω». Γνωρίζουν φυσικά ότι δεν μπορεί να έχουν λαϊκή αποδοχή μια σειρά μέτρων που δυσχεραίνουν ακόμη περισσότερο τους εργασιακούς όρους των υγειονομικών και αναγκάζουν τον λαό να βάλει ακόμη πιο βαθιά το χέρι στην τσέπη για να βρει την υγειά του.
 </p>
<p>
  Τα απογευματινά χειρουργεία, που τράβηξαν και την περισσότερη δημοσιότητα, είναι μια σοβαρή παρέμβαση για μια σειρά από λόγους. Όσον αφορά τα εργασιακά δικαιώματα, σε συνδυασμό με την κατεύθυνση οι γιατροί του ΕΣΥ να εργάζονται και στον ιδιωτικό τομέα, η κυβέρνηση απαντά στους υγειονομικούς να δουλέψουν περισσότερο, μπροστά στην κλιμακούμενη ακρίβεια και τους καθηλωμένους μισθούς. Χτυπιέται ακόμη περισσότερο το δικαίωμα στη μόνιμη και σταθερή δουλειά και το δικαίωμα να μπορούμε να ζούμε από μία δουλειά με αξιοπρεπείς συνθήκες και μισθούς που να καλύπτουν το κόστος ζωής. Πέραν τούτου, είναι πραγματική κοροϊδία για τους υγειονομικούς, όπου ο μέσος εργαζόμενος έχει ωφελούμενα ρεπό και άδειες από δύο και τρία προηγούμενα έτη και παλεύουν για προσλήψεις ως μοναδική απάντηση στην εντατικοποίηση, να τους λέει η κυβέρνηση «δουλέψτε περισσότερο». Αυτήν ακριβώς την πραγματικότητα καταδεικνύουν κι οι παραιτήσεις αναισθησιολόγων απ’ το Βενιζέλειο Ηρακλείου λόγω της υπερεργασίας. Καθόλου δεν είδαν τα απογευματινά χειρουργεία σαν αναβάθμιση της εργασιακής τους κατάστασης, όπως ευαγγελίζεται ο Γεωργιάδης. Κρυφό σημείο, αλλά ιδιαίτερα σοβαρό, είναι η λεγόμενη δικλείδα ασφαλείας απ’ την κυβέρνηση, δηλαδή η προϋπόθεση να ολοκληρώνεται το πρωινό έργο. Ωστόσο αυτό θα καταμετράται ανά κλινική και όχι ανά γιατρό, δημιουργώντας νέες αντιθέσεις και ανταγωνισμούς μεταξύ των γιατρών και γιατρούς δύο ταχυτήτων. Πάντως το πόσο θα παραμείνει το συγκεκριμένο μέτρο μένει να το δούμε, μιας και έχει επιχειρηθεί ξανά εδώ και πολλές δεκαετίες. Η εικόνα προς το παρόν είναι η εφαρμογή του με πιεστικούς και εκβιαστικούς όρους απ’ την πλευρά του υπουργείου, χωρίς βέβαια κατά τόπους να λείπουν κι οι πρόθυμοι, χρήσιμοι ηλίθιοι.
 </p>
<p>
  Όσον αφορά το δικαίωμα του λαού στην περίθαλψη, το επιχείρημα ότι θα μειωθεί η λίστα των χειρουργείων είναι το λιγότερο φαιδρό. Τα χέρια είναι δεδομένα και τα όρια της ανθρώπινης αντοχής επίσης. Εξάλλου είναι καταμετρημένες απ’ την ΠΟΕΔΗΝ οι κλειστές χειρουργικές αίθουσες που δεν λειτουργούν ήδη το πρωινό ωράριο λόγω έλλειψης προσωπικού. Υπάρχει φυσικά κι η εμπειρία απ’ τα απογευματινά ιατρεία, που όχι μόνο δεν μείωσε την αναμονή για εξέταση αλλά την επιδείνωσε και υποβάθμισε και την ποιότητα παροχής υπηρεσιών. Ο τιμοκατάλογος που δημοσιεύθηκε δεν είναι καθόλου ευκαταφρόνητος για το λαϊκό εισόδημα, που μαστίζεται απ’ την ακρίβεια. Αυτό όμως που κατά βάση επιχειρεί η κυβέρνηση είναι η επέκταση του πεδίου -και μέσα στα νοσοκομεία- όπου καταργείται η έννοια της δωρεάν περίθαλψης. Η επέκταση της αντίληψης σε κάθε πτυχή της περίθαλψης ότι δεν είναι δικαίωμα αλλά εμπόρευμα προς εξαγορά. Έτσι ώστε να μετατρέπεται σε «φυσιολογική» η κατάσταση ο ασθενής να πληρώνει για το κάθε τι. Σ’ αυτό το πλαίσιο, το νομοσχέδιο που έφερε προς ψήφιση ο Γεωργιάδης φορτώνει ένα σωρό ακόμη κόστη στον λαό, σε διάφορες βαθμίδες της περίθαλψης.
 </p>
<p>
  Ο λαός θα πληρώνει νέο χαράτσι για τις διαγνωστικές εξετάσεις ανά παραπεμπτικό. Ένα ευρώ για τις εργαστηριακές και τρία για τις απεικονιστικές, με σκοπό την αποπληρωμή του clawback. Το clawback ουσιαστικά είναι χρήματα που δεν πληρώθηκαν γιατροί και διαγνωστικά κέντρα για εξετάσεις που ήδη διενεργήθηκαν με κάλυψη ΕΟΠΥΥ λόγω των δημοσιονομικών αναπροσαρμογών. Τα επιτυχή πλεονάσματα του Μητσοτάκη κατά επιταγή των ιμπεριαλιστών ληστεύουν την περίθαλψη του λαού.
 </p>
<p>
  Έχουν ήδη προηγηθεί οι αυξήσεις στα φάρμακα, με πληρωμή επιπλέον της εισφοράς ακόμη κι όταν ο ασφαλισμένος λαμβάνει το φθηνότερο γενόσημο (βλ. ΠΣ φ.957). Αυτή η, κατά την κυβέρνηση «μικρή», διαφορά ξεκοκαλίζει τη σύνταξη των ηλικιωμένων, που συνήθως λαμβάνουν περισσότερα του ενός φάρμακα. Ειδικά σε περιπτώσεις που δεν τίθεται καν η επιλογή φθηνότερου φαρμάκου, μιας κι οι ελλείψεις έχουν γίνει κανονικότητα μετά την άρση απαγόρευσης εξαγωγών και τα φαρμακεία προμηθεύονται τα φάρμακα απ’ τις αποθήκες με το σταγονόμετρο. Στο πλάι αυτών, θεσπίζεται κι η πληρωμή πέντε ευρώ για τη διενέργεια του εμβολίου για τον COVID19 στα φαρμακεία.
 </p>
<p>
  Τέλος, αλλά σίγουρα όχι τελειωτικά μιας κι η ίδια πολιτική θα συνεχίσει όσο δεν συγκροτούνται ικανές λαϊκές αντιστάσεις, επί πληρωμή θα είναι και ο προσωπικός ιατρός. Ο προσωπικός γιατρός δηλωμένα έρχεται ν’ αποτελέσει φραγμό στην πρόσβαση των ασθενών στα νοσοκομεία. Μαζί με τον ηλεκτρονικό φάκελο ασθενή, η κυβέρνηση προσπαθεί να στεγανοποιήσει το περιβάλλον του ΕΣΥ, ώστε ν’ αναβαθμίσει τη δυνατότητά του να περιορίσει την πρόσβαση και να διευρύνει τις χρεώσεις. Σκόνταψε και στα δύο στην απροθυμία συμμετοχής των γιατρών, λόγω χαμηλών απολαβών και εντατικοποίησης. Ο ηλεκτρονικός φάκελος προχωράει με κονδύλια που εκταμιεύονται από ΕΕ και υποχρεωτική εφαρμογή στα νοσοκομεία. Το εμπόδιο της μη συμμετοχής των ιδιωτών γιατρών λόγω των χαμηλών απολαβών προσπερνιέται με το να πληρώνει τον γιατρό ο ασθενής. Το πιθανότερο τελικά είναι ο ασθενής να μην μπορεί καν να επισκεφθεί τον προσωπικό γιατρό ο οποίος θα του αρνηθεί την πρόσβαση στο νοσοκομείο. Φραγμός για τον φραγμό...
 </p>
<p>
  Η συνέχεια κι η ένταση της πολιτικής που θα ρημάζει εργασιακά δικαιώματα για τους υγειονομικούς και το δικαίωμα του λαού στη δωρεάν πλήρη και ίση για όλους περίθαλψη είναι δεδομένη. Αυτό που θα πρέπει να μας απασχολεί διαρκώς είναι το πώς οικοδομούνται αντιστάσεις απ’ την πλευρά των λαϊκών δυνάμεων στην κατεύθυνση να μπαίνει φραγμός σ’ αυτή την πολιτική. Ο σκόπελος των ξεπουλημένων συνδικαλιστικών ηγεσιών και η πολιτική γραμμή των ρεφορμιστικών δυνάμεων, με κύριο το ΚΚΕ, είναι αναγνωρισμένα εμπόδια στην ανάπτυξη αυτής της κατεύθυνσης. Όπως, όμως, δεδομένη είναι και η γενικευμένη λαϊκή δυσαρέσκεια, που μπορεί να τροφοδοτήσει σημαντικές εστίες αντίστασης.

<strong>
   Η ΕΕ δεν είναι των λαών, είναι των ιμπεριαλιστών!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Όχι στην εκμετάλλευση, την εξαθλίωση και τον πόλεμο!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Αλληλεγγύη - κοινή πάλη εργατών - λαών - μεταναστών/προσφύγων!

   Έξω η Ελλάδα από την ΕΕ! - Αποχή από τις ευρωεκλογές!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
   Από την αρχική της φάση και σε όλη τη διαδρομή της μέχρι τη σημερινή μορφή της, η ΕΕ υπήρξε και υπάρχει ως ένα εγχείρημα των ιμπεριαλιστών της Ευρώπης. Είναι ένας συνασπισμός για την υπηρέτηση και την προώθηση των συμφερόντων και των επιδιώξεων πριν από όλα των ιμπεριαλιστικών πυλώνων του. Οι αξεπέραστες αντιθέσεις μεταξύ αυτών των ιμπεριαλιστικών δυνάμεων είναι που βάζουν όρια στην «ενότητα» του εγχειρήματος, το οποίο κάθε άλλο παρά ιστορική νομοτέλεια είναι. Το Brexit ήταν μια σαφής εκδήλωση αυτών των αντιθέσεων, που σήμερα εκδηλώνονται μεταξύ των δύο βασικών πυλώνων του (Γαλλία-Γερμανία) και μεταφέρονται στους δορυφόρους τους, αλλά τροφοδοτούνται και από την ανάμειξη των ΗΠΑ σε μια σειρά χώρες και αστικές τάξεις που βρίσκονται στο σημερινό συνασπισμό των «27».
  </li>
<li>
   Ως εγχείρημα στην υπηρεσία του ευρωπαϊκού μονοπωλιακού κεφαλαίου, η ΕΕ πρωταγωνίστησε πάντα στην εκμετάλλευση και την καταλήστευση εργατών, λαών και χωρών εντός της ΕΕ και έξω από αυτήν. Η πολιτική αυτή κλιμακώθηκε μετά το ξέσπασμα της κρίσης του 2008 και συνεχίζεται ολοένα πιο άγρια, επιβεβαιώνοντας με τον πιο οδυνηρό τρόπο για τις εργαζόμενες μάζες ότι είναι αντιδραστικός μύθος η λεγόμενη «σύγκλιση». Οι χώρες της περιφέρειας, οι εξαρτημένες χώρες –είτε είναι είτε δεν είναι στην ΟΝΕ– γίνονται ολοένα και περισσότερο οικονομικά παραρτήματα των ιμπεριαλιστικών μονοπωλίων. Ταυτόχρονα, και εντός της Γαλλίας και της Γερμανίας κλιμακώνεται η άγρια καπιταλιστική επίθεση ενάντια στην εργατική τάξη, τον λαό και τη νεολαία. Οι μεγάλοι εργατικοί και λαϊκοί αγώνες που ξεσπούν και στις χώρες αυτές αντιμετωπίζονται με τρομοκρατία και καταστολή, με κήρυξη καταστάσεων απαγόρευσης και περιστολής των λαϊκών ελευθεριών. Όλα αυτά συνοδεύονται με την έξαρση του πιο χυδαίου αντικομμουνισμού που γίνεται νόμος και «θεσμός» από την ΕΕ και σε μια σειρά χώρες που βρίσκονται σε αυτήν. Η «κοιτίδα της δημοκρατίας» αποκαλύπτει διαρκώς τον αντιδημοκρατικό και βίαιο χαρακτήρα της, το αποτρόπαιο ιμπεριαλιστικό-καπιταλιστικό πρόσωπό της.
  </li>
<li>
   Ως συνασπισμός των Ευρωπαίων ιμπεριαλιστών, η ΕΕ πρωτοστατεί διαχρονικά στις πολεμικές επεμβάσεις, στις σφαγές λαών, στο κομμάτιασμα χωρών. Αυτή είναι, εξάλλου, η «ιστορική ταυτότητα» των πυλώνων της που συνεχίζουν την αποικιοκρατική τους ιστορία. Είτε ως σύνολο είτε διχασμένοι στη βάση των στρατηγικών συμφερόντων τους, ως στρατηγικό συμπλήρωμα του αμερικάνικου ιμπεριαλισμού, οι ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές και το εγχείρημά τους, η ΕΕ, αναδείχνονται μεγάλοι εχθροί της ανεξαρτησίας και της ίδιας της ζωής των λαών. Συνέβαλαν και συμβάλλουν στην τροφοδότηση του άδικου πολέμου στην Ουκρανία, στις εκατόμβες νεκρών και σακατεμένων, στην καταστροφή της χώρας αυτής. Στηρίζουν και υποθάλπουν τη σιωνιστική σφαγή, την εξελισσόμενη γενοκτονία του παλαιστινιακού λαού, κηρύσσοντας ταυτόχρονα απαγορευμένη εντός των μητροπόλεών τους τη σημαία ενός λαού που μάχεται ενάντια στον κατακτητή, για λεύτερη πατρίδα. Οργανώνουν και καθοδηγούν αδιανόητα μαζικά εγκλήματα μεταναστών και προσφύγων, ξεριζωμένων από χώρες και περιοχές που και οι ίδιοι οι ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές έχουν λεηλατήσει και βομβαρδίσει.
  </li>
<li>
   Στη σημερινή φάση των μεγάλων ιμπεριαλιστικών ανταγωνισμών που προετοιμάζουν έως και παγκόσμιο μακελειό, οι εκβιασμοί μεταξύ Γαλλίας-Γερμανίας (με τα πυρηνικά της η πρώτη, με την οικονομική πρωτοκαθεδρία της η δεύτερη) εναλλάσσονται με τις επιδιώξεις κοινών συμφωνιών. Συμφωνίες που θα τους επιτρέψουν να αντιμετωπίσουν τα κρίσιμα προβλήματά τους σε ενέργεια και πρώτες ύλες, καθώς βρίσκονται υπό την αμερικάνικη στρατηγική κηδεμονία, αλλά και σε μεγάλη πίεση από τη διείσδυση της Κίνας. Η όποια εξέλιξη προκύψει από αυτές τις αντιφατικές τακτικές και επιλογές των ιμπεριαλιστικών πυλώνων της ΕΕ στρέφεται ενάντια στους λαούς! Είτε με αναβαθμισμένη τη συνεργασία Παρισιού-Βερολίνου (και άρα με πιο συγκροτημένο το οικοδόμημα της ΕΕ), είτε με αναπαραγωγή και διεύρυνση των τωρινών διχασμών τους και την ΕΕ χωρισμένη σε «παλιά» και «νέα» (αμερικάνικη) Ευρώπη, οι λαοί μόνο χειρότερα δεινά έχουν να περιμένουν: άγρια εκμετάλλευση, καταπίεση και καταστολή, εκτόξευση των πολεμικών δαπανών και στρατιωτικοποίηση των οικονομιών, μεγαλύτερα βήματα προς τον παγκόσμιο πόλεμο!
  </li>
<li>
   Όλα τα παραπάνω αποτυπώνονται ήδη στα πολιτικά συστήματα όλων των χωρών της ΕΕ, που αντιμετωπίζουν την απαξίωση των εργατικών-λαϊκών μαζών και μετατοπίζονται σε αντιδραστική κατεύθυνση, και με την ανάδειξη (ακόμα και σε κυβερνητικούς ρόλους) ακροδεξιών δυνάμεων. Δυνάμεων που τροφοδοτούνται από τη γενικευμένη επίθεση ενάντια στο προλεταριάτο και τους λαούς, από την κλιμάκωση της πολιτικής που καταπνίγει ελευθερίες και δημοκρατικά δικαιώματα, της πολιτικής των πολέμων και των κηρυγμάτων εθνικισμού, μίσους και διχασμού των λαών. Ταυτόχρονα, στις ιμπεριαλιστικές χώρες (Γαλλία, Γερμανία, αλλά και Ιταλία) η ανάδειξη αυτών των ακροδεξιών δυνάμεων αποτελεί και έκφραση δυσαρέσκειας τμημάτων της μεγαλοαστικής τάξης που συμπιέζονται από τους ιμπεριαλιστικούς ανταγωνισμούς και αναζητούν απαντήσεις προβάλλοντας τον πιο επιθετικό εθνικισμό, τον ιμπεριαλιστικό.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Η «μεγάλη αναστάτωση» ενόψει των ευρωεκλογών του Ιουνίου και η κρισιμότητα που τους αποδίδουν οι ιμπεριαλιστές και οι αστικές δυνάμεις, στην πραγματικότητα αναφέρονται σε όλα τα παραπάνω ζητήματα. Οι κυρίαρχες δυνάμεις επιδιώκουν να αξιοποιηθούν οι ευρωκάλπες ως εργαλείο, αφενός για την αναστύλωση της –ξεφτισμένης συνολικά στις συνειδήσεις των λαών– «ιδέας» της ΕΕ, και αφετέρου για την αντιμετώπιση των προβλημάτων στα πολιτικά συστήματα της κάθε χώρας. Είναι πολύ χαρακτηριστικό ότι όλες οι ακροδεξιές δυνάμεις επιδίδονται με ζέση στην προεκλογική εκστρατεία και στηρίζουν την «ιδέα» της ΕΕ, χωρίς ίχνος «απομονωτιστικών» διαθέσεων. Αποδείχνουν έτσι ξανά την πλήρη υπόκλισή τους και στο ιμπεριαλιστικό πλαίσιο και στις ανάγκες της αστικής τάξης που η κάθε μια αναφέρεται.

   Στη χώρα μας, πίσω από την παραρτηματοποίηση της οικονομίας, την αποβιομηχάνιση και τη συρρίκνωση του πρωτογενή τομέα, πίσω από τη διαρκώς μεγαλύτερη ενεργειακή και διατροφική εξάρτηση βρίσκονται τα συμφέροντα των ευρωπαϊκών μονοπωλίων. Αυτά καθοδήγησαν μια ολόκληρη πορεία (44 χρόνων από την ένταξη στην τότε ΕΟΚ) καταστροφής παραγωγικών δυνάμεων και δυνατοτήτων, καταλήστευσης του πλούτου και των υποδομών της χώρας. Οι πολιτικές της ΕΕ βρίσκονται πίσω από το έγκλημα στα Τέμπη, πίσω από τον πνιγμό και την καταστροφή της Θεσσαλίας. Ταυτόχρονα, αυτές οι πολιτικές αποτέλεσαν και την πολιτική πλάτη στην πολύχρονη επίθεση που σαρώνει κατακτήσεις και γκρεμίζει εργασιακά, κοινωνικά και δημοκρατικά δικαιώματα της εργατικής τάξης, του λαού και της νεολαίας. Στο όνομα της «ευρωπαϊκής ιδέας», των «απαιτούμενων δημοσιονομικών προσαρμογών» και του «εναρμονισμού με το ενωσιακό δίκαιο», η άρχουσα τάξη και οι κυβερνήσεις στη χώρα προωθούν και επιβάλλουν χρόνια τώρα τον «εργασιακό μεσαίωνα», τη συντριβή της δωρεάν περίθαλψης και των δωρεάν σπουδών, το ξεκλήρισμα της φτωχομεσαίας αγροτιάς, τους μαζικούς πλειστηριασμούς των λαϊκών σπιτιών. Στον ίδιο «λογαριασμό», και στο πλαίσιο της διπλής εξάρτησης από ΗΠΑ και Ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές, βρίσκονται και τα θηριώδη εξοπλιστικά προγράμματα από Γερμανία και Γαλλία, καθώς και η συμφωνία με τη Γαλλία για στρατιωτική συνδρομή της Ελλάδας στις ανάγκες της ακόμα και στη ζώνη του Σαχέλ!
  </li>
<li>
   Η άρχουσα τάξη της χώρας έχει κάθε λόγο να παρουσιάζει στον λαό αυτόν τον πραγματικό απολογισμό αντεστραμμένο, να επιδιώκει σταθερά να παρουσιάσει την ΕΕ ως μια προοδευτική νομοτέλεια για τον λαό και τη χώρα. Γιατί είναι δεμένη και εξαρτημένη με χίλια νήματα από τους ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές και τής είναι αδιανόητη η αναπαραγωγή της έξω από αυτό το πλαίσιο. Γιατί με το να είναι μέλος της ΕΕ/ΟΝΕ αντλεί πολιτική ισχύ έναντι της εργατικής τάξης και του λαού. Γιατί τα μεταπρατικά μεγαλοαστικά τζάκια θησαυρίζουν ξεπουλώντας τον πλούτο και τις υποδομές της χώρας, παίρνοντας ποσοστά στα μεγάλα έργα, κάνοντας μεσιτείες και εισαγωγές-εξαγωγές στο πλευρό και ως παράρτημα των ευρωπαϊκών μονοπωλίων. Γιατί τα ίδια τζάκια παρασιτούν με τις δόσεις των δισ. ευρώ του «Ευρωπαϊκού Ταμείου Ανάκαμψης», που πληρώνεται στο πολλαπλάσιο από τον ιδρώτα και τα δικαιώματα των εργατών και του λαού. Γιατί συνολικά το ντόπιο κεφάλαιο αυξάνει τη λεηλασία της εργατικής δύναμης και των λαϊκών εισοδημάτων καθώς οι πλάτες των προστατών στηρίζουν την άγρια καπιταλιστική επίθεση.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Γι’ αυτό όλα τα κόμματα του συστήματος (από τα ακροδεξιά ως τα λεγόμενα κεντροαριστερά) βομβαρδίζουν τον λαό απαιτώντας να ξεχάσει, να αγνοήσει τα δεινά που συσσώρευσε και συσσωρεύει από την ένταξη της χώρας στην ΕΕ/ΟΝΕ, και να αναζητήσει (με αυτές ή τις άλλες διαπραγματεύσεις) μέσα σε αυτήν το μέλλον του! Γι’ αυτό και στο όνομα της «συνεργασίας των λαών» που τάχα η ΕΕ εκπροσωπεί, η χώρα και οι θάλασσές της μετατρέπονται σε τάφο και σε φυλακή των ξεριζωμένων κομματιών των λαών, ώστε να προστατεύονται τα ευρωπαϊκά σύνορα από τους κατατρεγμένους. Με την ίδια επίκληση (της «συνεργασίας των λαών») η χώρα διατάσσεται σε θέση πολέμου και έχθρας με τους λαούς της περιοχής, ώστε να υπηρετηθούν οι ευρωατλαντικοί προστάτες της!
 </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
   Όλες αυτές οι πολιτικές της ΕΕ διαμορφώνονται και αποφασίζονται σε μυστικές και φανερές συσκέψεις των ιμπεριαλιστικών επιτελείων της, μέσα από τις αντιθέσεις και τους συμβιβασμούς τους και την πάγια επιδίωξή τους να σύρουν με «καρότα» και εκβιασμούς και τις εξαρτημένες αστικές τάξεις του οικοδομήματός τους. Ακόμα και το «τυπικό» των κανονισμών και των διαδικασιών λήψης αποφάσεων προσαρμόζεται όλο και περισσότερο σε αυτήν την πραγματικότητα, καθώς οι επείγουσες ιμπεριαλιστικές ανάγκες απαιτούν μια όλο και πιο ευπροσάρμοστη στα συμφέροντά τους ΕΕ. Πάνω σε αυτή την πραγματικότητα έχει στηθεί η απάτη του λεγόμενου Ευρωκοινοβουλίου, που έχει ρόλο δημοκρατικής διακόσμησης του ιμπεριαλιστικού συνασπισμού. Ωστόσο, ούτε αυτό δεν (θα μπορούσε να) είναι απλώς μια αθώα φάρσα. Τα πρόσφατα (π.χ. Καϊλή) και παλιότερα «σκάνδαλα» αναδείχνουν πως –ως φυτώριο παραγωγής και ανάδειξης στελεχών του μηχανισμού της γραφειοκρατίας των Βρυξελλών– είναι ταυτόχρονα και πεδίο διαμόρφωσης των χρυσοπληρωμένων λόμπι του ευρωπαϊκού κεφαλαίου για την προώθηση των κάθε είδους συμφερόντων του εντός της ΕΕ, αλλά και σε Αφρική, Μ. Ανατολή, Βαλκάνια.
  </li>
<li>
   Με βάση όλα τα παραπάνω, είναι πιο φανερό και από τον ήλιο πως οι μεγάλοι αγώνες, τα αιτήματα και τα συμφέροντα των εργατικών-λαϊκών μαζών της Ευρώπης δεν μπορούν να «συναντηθούν» –και πολύ περισσότερο να δικαιωθούν– μέσα στη φυλακή των λαών που οι ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές συγκρότησαν και ακούει στο όνομα ΕΕ! Τα ταξικά δικαιώματα και η επαναστατική προοπτική των μαζών δεν μπορούν να εκφραστούν σε ένα όργανο όπως το Ευρωκοινοβούλιο, που δεν είναι κατάκτηση των λαών, αλλά ιμπεριαλιστική κατασκευή. Στην καταγγελία αυτής της κατασκευής και στην πάλη ενάντια στην ΕΕ βρίσκεται ο δρόμος της «συνάντησης» των αγώνων, της διεθνιστικής αλληλεγγύης, της ανάπτυξης της μαζικής πάλης των εργατών και των λαών. Η πάλη αυτή διαμορφώνει όρους επαναστατικής προοπτικής στο βαθμό που χειραφετείται από το πολιτικό πλαίσιο που ορίζει το καπιταλιστικό-ιμπεριαλιστικό σύστημα, στο βαθμό που αρνείται να καναλιζαριστεί σε αυτό το πολιτικό πλαίσιο και ανοίγει τους δικούς της δρόμους.
  </li>
<li>
   Στη χώρα μας, η παρατεταμένη προεκλογική εκστρατεία ενόψει της 9
   <sup>
    ης
   </sup>
   του Ιούνη όλων των κομμάτων του επίσημου πολιτικού συστήματος, από τη μια απηχεί την ανάγκη υπεράσπισης της «ευρωπαϊκής ιδέας». Όμως, το ερώτημα «ποια Ευρώπη θέλουμε», που προβάλλουν τα κόμματα του συστήματος και οι συνοδοιπόροι τους, θα ήταν φάρσα αν ο λαός μας δεν ζούσε μια εξελισσόμενη τραγωδία σε βάρος όλων των στοιχειωδών δικαιωμάτων του. Από την άλλη, η παρατεταμένη προεκλογική ένταση απηχεί την επιχείρηση αναστύλωσης του απαξιωμένου στον λαό πολιτικού συστήματος σε ακόμα πιο αντιδραστική βάση. Οι δυνάμεις του συμβιβασμού –όπως η ηγεσία του ΚΚΕ– συμβάλλουν σε αυτή τη δεξιά πορεία, ακόμα και στην πολιτική νομιμοποίηση της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης και της απάτης που λέγεται Ευρωκοινοβούλιο, ενώ υποτίθεται ότι καταγγέλλουν την ΕΕ και τις πολιτικές της. Η ηγεσία αυτή έφτασε στο σημείο να ανακαλύψει τον «αριστερό ευρωμονόδρομο»: Χρησιμοποιεί το «ορόσημο» της ευρωκάλπης ως λόγο να ανακοπούν οι μαζικοί αγώνες νεολαίας, αγροτών, εργαζομένων για να δοθεί η «πολιτική μάχη των ευρωεκλογών»!
  </li>
<li>
   Η πλατιά λαϊκή αποστροφή και δυσαρέσκεια απέναντι στην πολιτική της κυβέρνησης της ΝΔ, την πολιτική του συστήματος και όλων των κομμάτων που τη στηρίζουν –από τη λεγόμενη κεντροαριστερά (ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, ΠΑΣΟΚ, Πλεύση, Νέα Αριστερά) και από ακροδεξιά (Βελόπουλος, Νίκη, Σπαρτιάτες)– δεν χωράει στο «επίσημο γκάλοπ» των ευρωεκλογών. Δεν πρέπει να διαστραφεί με τον εκβιασμό της αποδοχής της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης από την ΕΕ.
   <strong>
    Ο λαός δεν έχει κανένα λόγο να συμμεριστεί την αναστάτωση και τις αντιδραστικές διεργασίες του πολιτικού συστήματος. Έχει κάθε λόγο να συνεχίσει στο δρόμο των μαζικών αγώνων και κάθε λόγο να αρνηθεί την ευρωκάλπη, να απέχει από αυτήν. Γιατί αυτή
   </strong>
   η εκλογική στάση αντιστοιχεί στην προβολή της αναγκαίας θέσης «ΕΞΩ Η ΕΛΛΑΔΑ ΑΠΌ ΤΗΝ ΕΕ». Γιατί αυτή η εκλογική στάση αναδείχνει τη
   <strong>
    συνολική άρνηση
   </strong>
   της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης από ΗΠΑ και ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές, την άρνηση του «μονόδρομου» της φτώχειας, της εξαθλίωσης, της εκμετάλλευσης και των πολέμων, τον οποίο διασφαλίζει το πλαίσιο της εξάρτησης της χώρας.
  </li>
<li>
   Με βάση τη θέση για
   <strong>
    Αποχή από τις ευρωεκλογές
   </strong>
   επιδιώκουμε συντονισμό με αγωνιστικές, αριστερές, επαναστατικές δυνάμεις στην Ευρώπη. Στην ίδια βάση, επιδιώκουμε και στη χώρα μας την πιο πλατιά ανάδειξη αυτής της κατεύθυνσης, τον συντονισμό, τη συμπόρευση και την από κοινού διαμόρφωση πολιτικής καμπάνιας για την προβολή της θέσης «ΕΞΩ Η ΕΛΛΑΔΑ ΑΠΟ ΤΗΝ ΕΕ», για την άρνηση και την εναντίωση στην ευρωκάλπη και τις αντιδραστικές επιδιώξεις των κομμάτων και των δυνάμεων του συστήματος.

  Συνεχίζονται οι αντιδραστικές μεθοδεύσεις της κυβέρνησης της ΝΔ στον χώρο της εκπαίδευσης, προχωρώντας το υπουργείο Παιδείας σε νέες εισηγήσεις που αφορούν τις προϋποθέσεις για την απόκτηση του Εθνικού Απολυτηρίου στα Λύκεια. Στο πλαίσιο του διαλόγου που διεξάγεται για τη «μεγάλη μεταρρύθμιση στην Πρωτοβάθμια και τη Δευτεροβάθμια Εκπαίδευση», έρχεται να προστεθεί στο προαναγγελμένο -από την κυβέρνηση- εξεταστικό κάτεργο του νέου λυκείου η προϋπόθεση της πιστοποίησης γνώσης των αγγλικών και της πληροφορικής για την απόκτηση του Εθνικού Απολυτηρίου. Δεν πρόκειται για «φετινή έμπνευση» του Κυριάκου Πιερρακάκη, καθώς ήδη από το 2017 το Ινστιτούτο Εκπαιδευτικής Πολιτικής, ως αρμόδιος φορέας του Υπουργείου Παιδείας για τον σχεδιασμό των αντιδραστικών μεθοδεύσεων στην εκπαίδευση, έκανε λόγο για πλάνο ενσωμάτωσης της πιστοποίησης της αγγλικής γλώσσας, ως πρώτης ξένης γλώσσας στο σχολείο από την Α’ Λυκείου. Η επίθεση των κυβερνήσεων στην εκπαίδευση κλιμακώνεται και είναι σίγουρο πως για την απόκτηση των εν λόγω πιστοποιήσεων οι μαθητές θα αναγκάζονται να στραφούν σε περισσότερα φροντιστήρια για να μπορέσουν να ανταπεξέλθουν, αφήνοντας στο περιθώριο όλους εκείνους που δεν θα έχουν την οικονομική δυνατότητα να ξεπεράσουν ακόμη έναν ταξικό φραγμό.
 </p>
<p>
  Τα εμπόδια για τους μαθητές των φτωχών και λαϊκών στρωμάτων πολλαπλασιάζονται. Η κυβέρνηση προσπαθεί με γοργούς ρυθμούς να ξεδιπλώσει την ατζέντα της επίθεσης στα σχολεία. Αναφέρεται πως το Εθνικό Απολυτήριο θα «εγκαινιαστεί» από τους μαθητές που θα φοιτήσουν στην Α’ Λυκείου το επόμενο σχολικό έτος, οι οποίοι θα πρέπει να αντιμετωπίσουν και στις τρεις τάξεις του λυκείου ένα εξεταστικό κάτεργο αντίστοιχο των πανελλαδικών, με θέματα από την Τράπεζα Θεμάτων και ειδικό συντελεστή βαρύτητας ανά τάξη (μεγαλύτερος στη Γ’ και μικρότερος στην Α’ Λυκείου), ενώ παράλληλα προβλέπεται ο προσδιορισμός του αριθμού των εισακτέων στην τριτοβάθμια από τα τμήματα των Πανεπιστημίων.
  <strong>
   Με ψηφισμένο πλέον τον νόμο για τα Ιδιωτικά Πανεπιστήμια, συνεχίζεται να εφαρμόζεται το σκληρά ταξικό πλαίσιο, μέσα στο οποίο τα παιδιά των λαϊκών οικογενειών όχι απλά θα πετιούνται εκτός των Πανεπιστημίων, αλλά και από τα Γενικά Λύκεια, προβάλλοντας η κυβέρνηση σαν εναλλακτική τη διοχέτευση προς την επαγγελματική εκπαίδευση και τη μαθητεία.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Η αντίσταση των μαθητών για να μην περάσουν τα νέα μέτρα και για να ανατραπούν όλοι οι αντιλαϊκοί ψηφισμένοι νόμοι στην εκπαίδευση αποτελεί αναγκαιότητα. Μέσα από τα 5μελή και τα 15μελή συνδικαλιστικά τους όργανα, με όπλα τις γενικές συνελεύσεις, τις καταλήψεις και τις διαδηλώσεις, πρέπει να πάρουν αποφάσεις για τη συνέχιση του αγώνα! Πλάι στους φοιτητές που επί μήνες έδωσαν έναν μαζικό και μαχητικό αγώνα για να μην περάσει ο νόμος Πιερρακάκη. Δίπλα στους εκπαιδευτικούς που τρομοκρατούνται επειδή διεκδικούν εργασιακά δικαιώματα και σέρνονται σε δίκες για τη συνδικαλιστική τους δράση. Ο αγώνας ενάντια στην παιδεία των λίγων και εκλεκτών είναι υπόθεση πάλης όλου του λαού.

  Η εισβολή αστυνομικών δυνάμεων στη Σχολή Θετικών Επιστημών (ΣΘΕ) του ΑΠΘ, το μεσημέρι του Σαββάτου 16/3 για την εκκένωση των καταλήψεων που τελούνταν σε τμήματα εντός της και η σύλληψη 49 φοιτητών αποτελεί σοβαρό δείγμα του ρεβανσισμού του συστήματος απέναντι στο φοιτητικό κίνημα.
 </p>
<p>
  Χρησιμοποιώντας σαν αφορμή φθορές έξω από τη «βιβλιοθήκη» στο πρώην στέκι του Βιολογικού (που εδώ και 2 χρόνια από όταν εκκενώθηκε, ακόμα… γίνεται βιβλιοθήκη), αστυνομικές δυνάμεις εισέβαλαν στον χώρο της ΣΘΕ την ώρα που πραγματοποιούνταν δράση στα πλαίσια της κατάληψης του Σ.Φ. Γεωλογίας, συλλαμβάνοντας μαζικά φοιτητές, στους οποίους απέδωσαν κατηγορίες για διατάραξη κοινής ειρήνης και απείθεια. Μάλιστα, οι συλληφθέντες φοιτητές κρατήθηκαν στη ΓΑΔΘ μέχρι και τη Δευτέρα 18/3, λέγοντάς τους ότι «μπροστά στους 2 μήνες που κρατάνε την κατάληψη, οι 2 μέρες κράτησης δεν είναι τίποτα». Είναι σαφές ότι ο πραγματικός λόγος αυτής της επιχείρησης καταστολής δεν είναι καμία φθορά κτηρίου ή «παράνομη ενέργεια». Έψαχναν μόνο μια αφορμή, μέχρι και αυτή του… «πυρηνικού ριφιφί», ή ό,τι άλλο μπορούσαν να σκαρφιστούν, για να δικαιολογήσουν την εισβολή και την άγρια καταστολή.
 </p>
<p>
  Το χρονικό της εκκένωσης και του οργίου συλλήψεων στη ΣΘΕ δεν είναι τυχαίο. Σε μια φάση όπου το φοιτητικό κίνημα βρίσκεται σε υποχώρηση, το σύστημα βρήκε την ευκαιρία να πάρει τη «ρεβάνς», να χτυπήσει όποια ψεγάδια καταλήψεων και αντιστάσεων έχουν παραμείνει στις σχολές. Δεν είναι, άλλωστε, η πρώτη εκκένωση κατάληψης που έχει δει το φοιτητικό κίνημα στον δίμηνο αγώνα του ενάντια στον, πλέον ψηφισμένο, νόμο Πιερρακάκη. Η εκκένωση της κατάληψης της Νομικής στην Κομοτηνή, της Νομικής του ΑΠΘ, αλλά και της Πρυτανείας, πριν από λίγες εβδομάδες έδειξαν τις κυβερνητικές διαθέσεις. Μέχρι και στις Φοιτητικές Εστίες του Πανεπιστημίου Αθηνών (ΦΕΠΑ) εισέβαλαν, συλλαμβάνοντας 3 φοιτητές και αποδίδοντάς τους 3 κατηγορίες. Το σύστημα φοβάται τη φοιτητική νεολαία που, εδώ και 2 μήνες, βρίσκεται στους δρόμους και αγωνίζεται. Ιδιαιτέρως, δεν ανέχεται τους φοιτητές που, ακόμη και μετά την ψήφιση του νόμου, επιμένουν να βγαίνουν στον δρόμο για να τον ανατρέψουν.
 </p>
<p>
  Το φοιτητικό κίνημα, λοιπόν, καλείται να τα βάλει με θεούς και δαίμονες. Πρώτα και κύρια, καλείται να τα βάλει με το σύστημα, που όλο και οξύνει τις μεθόδους καταστολής του. Η άμεση καταστολή και το σπάσιμο των καταλήψεων αποτελεί συνέχεια όλων των υπόλοιπων μεθόδων καταστολής, με πρώτη και κύρια την αξιοποίηση των τηλε-εξετάσεων και των τηλε-μαθημάτων, που αποτέλεσε έναν ύπουλο τρόπο να απομαζικοποιηθούν και να σπάσουν οι καταλήψεις χωρίς γάτα και ζημιά. Η καταστολή των διαδηλώσεων με άγριο τρόπο, τα χημικά και το «κυνηγητό» φοιτητών μέσα στο Άσυλο δεν αρκούν στο σύστημα. Τώρα βρίσκει την ευκαιρία για την ενεργοποίηση και την αξιοποίηση των πειθαρχικών διώξεων του νόμου Κεραμέως-Χρυσοχοΐδη (4777). Ήδη η κυβέρνηση, δια στόματος Μητσοτάκη, και η ΠτΔ, Κ. Σακελλαροπούλου, ζήτησαν την εφαρμογή για πρώτη φορά των έσχατων πειθαρχικών διώξεων που προβλέπει ο Νόμος Κεραμέως, δηλαδή της διαγραφής (μεταξύ μιας σειράς άλλων ποινών) στην περίπτωση των 49 συλληφθέντων φοιτητών, αλλά και σε μελλοντικές αντίστοιχες περιπτώσεις «παράνομων» ενεργειών. Το φοιτητικό κίνημα, λοιπόν, στον αγώνα του ενάντια στον νόμο Πιερρακάκη, θα κληθεί να αντιπαρατεθεί και με τις διατάξεις του νόμου 4777 (που ήδη κομμάτια του, όπως αυτό της ΕΒΕ, εφαρμόζονται), με τις διαγραφές και τα πειθαρχικά, αλλά και με όλο το κατασταλτικό οπλοστάσιο που έχει το σύστημα στα χέρια του.
 </p>
<p>
  Καλείται, από την άλλη, να τα βάλει και με τους ψεύτικους φίλους του. Με ευθύνη των κύριων ρεφορμιστικών δυνάμεων (ΚΝΕ-ΑΡΙΣ) που κήρυξαν παύση του κινήματος, αλλά και όλων των υπόλοιπων που βλέπουν την πάλη για την ανατροπή του νόμου ως κάτι το «ουτοπικό», οι φοιτητές, που κινητοποιήθηκαν με επιμονή όλο το προηγούμενο διάστημα, έμειναν ξεκρέμαστοι. Από τη μία ΚΝΕ-ΑΡΙΣ κάνουν λόγο για «πολύμορφες δράσεις πέραν της κατάληψης», οι οποίες από ό,τι φαίνεται δεν συμπεριλαμβάνουν καν… τη διαδήλωση. Μάλιστα, στην πλειοψηφία των συλλόγων πανελλαδικά, αυτές οι δυνάμεις είναι που συσπειρώνουν πλέον τα πλαίσια «αντι-κατάληψης», ενώ με το ζόρι (έως καθόλου) στήριξαν τις κινητοποιήσεις αλληλεγγύης στους συλληφθέντες φοιτητές. Από την άλλη, η ΑΡΑΣ και μια σειρά άλλες δυνάμεις βγαίνουν με τη σημαία του «να μείνει ο νόμος στα χαρτιά». Λες και δεν είδαμε με την Ελάχιστη Βάση Εισαγωγής τι συμβαίνει με τους νόμους που «έμειναν στα χαρτιά». Κάποια στιγμή το σύστημα τους εφαρμόζει!
 </p>
<p>
  Κόντρα, λοιπόν, σε αυτές τις λογικές, το φοιτητικό κίνημα πρέπει να στυλώσει τα πόδια του και να συνεχίσει τον αγώνα για την ανατροπή του νόμου Πιερρακάκη. Να συνεχίσει με εκ νέου γενικές συνελεύσεις, που θα παίρνουν αποφάσεις συνέχισης του αγώνα με νέες καταλήψεις και διαδηλώσεις. Το φοιτητικό κίνημα έχει δείξει ότι μπορεί να ανατρέψει μέχρι και ψηφισμένους νόμους, και καμία δύναμη -συστημική ή ρεφορμιστική- δεν μπορεί να το διαψεύσει αυτό!
 </p>
<p>
  Και αυτή είναι που θα αποτελέσει και την πραγματική απάντηση στην τρομοκρατία και την καταστολή. Αυτή είναι που θα αποτελέσει την πραγματική απάντηση στις ανυπόστατες κατηγορίες των 49 συλληφθέντων της ΣΘΕ και στις απειλές για πειθαρχικές διώξεις και διαγραφές φοιτητών. Το φοιτητικό κίνημα μόνο με τις μαζικές του διαδικασίες μπορεί να «προστατευτεί» και να απαντήσει την τρομοκρατία! Με μαζικές γενικές συνελεύσεις που θα παίρνουν αποφάσεις αλληλεγγύης στους συλληφθέντες, θα απαιτούν την αθώωσή τους και που θα παίρνουν αποφάσεις συνέχισης του αγώνα μέχρι τη νίκη!

  Η πιθανή ήττα της Ουκρανίας θα αναδείξει τις αδυναμίες των δυτικών μηχανισμών. Και αυτό είναι κάτι που επιτείνει το αίσθημα στρατηγικού αδιεξόδου, ιδιαίτερα για τους ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές.
 </p>
<p>
  Η κατάσταση στο ουκρανικό μέτωπο είναι τέτοια που πλέον δεν υπαγορεύει σενάρια για την εξελισσόμενη σύγκρουση, αλλά για την επόμενη μέρα. Έχοντας η Μόσχα την πρωτοβουλία κινήσεων, το αγωνιώδες ερώτημα είναι όχι πού θα σταματήσει, αλλά πού θέλει να σταματήσει. Τα κέντρα της Δύσης εκτιμούν, και βάσιμα, πως οι στόχοι της πλέον δεν περιορίζονται στα σύνορα των τεσσάρων επαρχιών που προσαρτήθηκαν.
 </p>
<p>
  Η ευρωπαϊκή (αν)ασφάλεια έχει πολλές εκδοχές και ποικίλες εκδηλώσεις. Το τελευταίο διάστημα η επικαιρότητα μονοπωλείται από τις απειλές (λεονταρισμούς) του Μακρόν, που ξεκινούν με τη δήλωση «βόμβα» ότι δεν θα πρέπει να αποκλειστεί η αποστολή ΝΑΤΟϊκών δυνάμεων στην Ουκρανία.
 </p>
<p>
  Δεν πέρασε πολύς χρόνος από τον Ιούνιο του 2022, όταν ο Μακρόν δήλωνε: «
  <em>
   είμαι πεπεισμένος ότι ο ρόλος της Γαλλίας είναι αυτός μιας διαμεσολαβητικής δύναμης
  </em>
  »! Σήμερα, παρά τις ασάφειες και τις παλινωδίες του, ρίχνει συνεχώς λάδι στη φωτιά... «
  <em>
   Δεν είμαστε σε ευθεία σύρραξη με τη Ρωσία, αλλά δεν μπορούμε να την αφήσουμε να κερδίσει
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   Δεν είμαστε σε πόλεμο με τη Ρωσία, αλλά αυτή διεξάγει πόλεμο σε βάρος μας
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   Αν η Ρωσία κερδίσει αυτόν τον πόλεμο, η αξιοπιστία της Ευρώπης θα μειωθεί στο μηδέν
  </em>
  » κ.λπ. Για τη Μόσχα μια τέτοια επίδειξη δύναμης (έστω και ρητορική) από τον επικεφαλής του γαλλικού κράτους, εκτός από ένα είδος μπλόφας, μπορεί να θεωρηθεί και «τροχιοδεικτικό» των δυτικών προθέσεων.
 </p>
<p>
  Ωστόσο η αντιρωσική πλειοδοσία του Μακρόν ίσως έχει και άλλες προεκτάσεις. Η αστική γαλλική τάξη βλέπει την «αξιοπιστία» της να μειώνεται τα τελευταία χρόνια σε μια παραδοσιακή σφαίρα επιρροής της: τη Δυτική Αφρική. Το αν η ανατολική άκρη της Ευρώπης μπορεί να αποτελέσει αντισταθμιστικό πεδίο δράσης του γαλλικού ιμπεριαλισμού είναι πολύ αμφίβολο. Πάντως, λίγο - πολύ, ο Μακρόν διαμηνύει στις χώρες της Α. Ευρώπης ότι η Γαλλία δεν έχει τις αναστολές της Γερμανίας και είναι πρόθυμη (και ικανή;) να αντικαταστήσει τις εγγυήσεις των ΗΠΑ σε εθνικό ή και σε ευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο! Η πρόθεση αυτή επικαιροποιήθηκε στην πρόσφατη τριμερή διάσκεψη κορυφής Γερμανίας, Γαλλίας και Πολωνίας στο Βερολίνο.
 </p>
<p>
  Από τη μεριά του ο γερμανός καγκελάριος Σολτς, αφού διευκρίνισε ότι οι χώρες που υποστηρίζουν την Ουκρανία δεν βρίσκονται σε πόλεμο με τη Ρωσία, αρκέστηκε στις διακηρύξεις τω Βρυξελλών σχετικά με την αρωγή της Ευρώπης προς την Ουκρανία. Το ζήτημα είναι σε ποιο βαθμό ελέγχει την τρικομματική του κυβέρνηση; Στις ακραίες φιλονατοϊκές και αντιρωσικές δηλώσεις της ΥΠΕΞ Μπέρμποκ (Πράσινοι), προστέθηκε η υπουργός Παιδείας της Γερμανίας Βάτσινγκερ (Φιλελεύθεροι), που, σε συνέντευξη που παραχώρησε στις εφημερίδες του ομίλου Funke, προτείνει προετοιμασία των μαθητών (στο πλαίσιο της πολιτικής προστασίας) για το ενδεχόμενο πολέμου… Το φαντάζεται μάλιστα ως κομμάτι της καθημερινής ζωής!
 </p>
<p>
  Τα ενδεχόμενα δεν είναι πολλά. Ή η Δύση θα κινηθεί προς την κατεύθυνση μιας πλήρους σύγκρουσης με τη Ρωσία ή θα προσπαθήσει να την ανακόψει με διαπραγματεύσεις, μετριάζοντας το όποιο κόστος. Αν ισχύσει το δεύτερο (πράγμα που δεν σημαίνει και τον άμεσο τερματισμό του πολέμου), οι όροι κατά βάση θα υπαγορεύονται από τη Μόσχα. Είναι φανερό πως οι δύο πλευρές δεν προσεγγίζουν με τον ίδιο τρόπο μια κατάπαυση του πυρός στην Ουκρανία. Δεν είναι μόνο ότι αυτή θα πρέπει να ξεκινήσει από την αποδοχή των νέων συνόρων και την παγίωση των όποιων κεκτημένων τους, αλλά θα πρέπει να απαντά και στους μακροπρόθεσμους στρατηγικούς τους στόχους. Σε ένα τέτοιο σενάριο εκτιμάται πως η ρωσική αντιπροσωπεία θα προσεγγίσει το τραπέζι με μια αίσθηση στρατηγικού πλεονεκτήματος. Για το Κρεμλίνο είναι βασικός όρος ότι οι διαπραγματεύσεις δεν θα ορίσουν μια νέα «παγωμένη σύγκρουση» ή «ένα διάλειμμα για επανεξοπλισμό της Ουκρανίας».
 </p>
<p>
  Ο Ρώσος πρόεδρος (που δεν αγωνιούσε ιδιαίτερα για την επανεκλογή του) δεν φαίνεται να βάζει σε πρώτο πλάνο τις διαβουλεύσεις. Σε δημόσια πανηγυρική ομιλία του (για την εκλογική του νίκη και την επέτειο προσάρτησης της Κριμαίας), επανέλαβε τις προειδοποιήσεις προς τη Δύση για χρήση πυρηνικών σε τυχόν «επίσημη» ανάπτυξη δυτικών στρατευμάτων στα ουκρανικά εδάφη. Αυτές οι προειδοποιήσεις Πούτιν δεν γίνονται στο κενό. Το φόντο είναι μακροχρόνιο και τα επίδικα ξεπερνούν τα σύνορα της Ουκρανίας. Έγινε καθαρό από τη Ρωσία πως μια πιθανή διαπραγμάτευση Δύσης- Ρωσίας δεν θα περιοριστεί τόσο στο «εδαφικό» όσο στη μελλοντική ουδετερότητα και αποστρατιωτικοποίησή της. Και ενδεχομένως να απαιτηθούν διασφαλίσεις που να αφορούν όλη την Α. Ευρώπη
 </p>
<p>
  Κατά την εκτίμηση δυτικών αναλυτών, φαίνεται ότι οι ΗΠΑ θα αρκούνταν να αποχωρήσει η Ρωσία από την Ουκρανία χωρίς άλλες εδαφικές κατακτήσεις. Ως ένδειξη κατευνασμού του Πούτιν θεωρείται η απόλυση της Νούλαντ, νούμερο 3 στο Στέιτ Ντιπάρτμεντ, με πεδίο ευθύνης την Ουκρανία εδώ και τουλάχιστον δέκα χρόνια. Ωστόσο η ενέργεια αυτή θα μπορούσε να θεωρηθεί και έμμεση παραδοχή των επιτευγμάτων της Ρωσίας στην Ουκρανία!
 </p>
<p>
  Οι εξελίξεις στο ουκρανικό μέτωπο ρίχνουν βαριά σκιά ήδη στο προεκλογικό τοπίο των ευρωεκλογών του Ιουνίου και των αμερικανικών εκλογών του Νοεμβρίου. Στην άλλη πλευρά του Ατλαντικού και στο φόντο της άγριας προεκλογικής κόντρας, ο Μπάιντεν εκφώνησε μια από τις πιο πολιτικές -και σημαντικές- ομιλίες για την κατάσταση της Ένωσης, παρουσιάζοντας με δραματικό τρόπο τα διακυβεύματα των επικείμενων εκλογών. Το πιο εντυπωσιακό στην ομιλία του ήταν (αν και οι ΗΠΑ δεν απειλούνται άμεσα με πόλεμο) ότι την ξεκίνησε επικαλούμενος την κατάσταση της Ένωσης επί Ρούσβελτ τον Ιανουάριο του 1941, πριν από την είσοδο της Αμερικής στον Β' Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο. Στο ρόλο του Χίτλερ και των Ναζί έβαλε τον πρώην Πρόεδρο Τραμπ και το κίνημά του: «Make America Great Again» (MAGA). Ο Μπάιντεν επανερχόταν επανειλημμένα στο θέμα της συνδυασμένης εσωτερικής και εξωτερικής απειλής, με έμφαση στην εσωτερική! Μάλιστα έφτασε να ταυτίζει τον Τραμπ με τους Συνομοσπονδιακούς που αποσχίστηκαν από την Ενωση στον αμερικανικό εμφύλιο.
 </p>
<p>
  Όλα αυτά αντανακλούν φόβους για τους συσχετισμούς που πάνε να διαμορφωθούν, όπως δείχνουν άλλωστε οι εξελίξεις, και το αβέβαιο της κατάληξής τους τόσο στα πεδία των μαχών σε Ουκρανία αλλά και Γάζα όσο και σε ολόκληρη τη Μέση Ανατολή. Αναδεικνύονται αστάθμητοι παράμετροι που διαμορφώνουν μια πρωτοφανή κατάσταση, θέτοντας γενικότερα ζητήματα επαναξιολόγησης των ιμπεριαλιστικών σχέσεων. Μια κατάσταση λεπτών ισορροπιών, που αντανακλά τη διακύβευση των συμφερόντων των κυρίαρχων ιμπεριαλιστών τόσο περιφερειακά όσο και συνολικά στην παγκόσμια σκηνή.
 </p>
<p>
  Μια κατάσταση που, αναδεικνύοντας την πολύπλευρη δυναμική της, ενδέχεται να αποτελέσει την αιτία για αναπόφευκτη όσο και βίαιη αναπροσαρμογή των στρατηγικών και των προτεραιοτήτων του ιμπεριαλισμού των ΗΠΑ. Μια κατάσταση όπου η «συνέχιση της πολιτικής με άλλα μέσα» θα τείνει να γίνει κανόνας.

  Dopo la caduta
del regime fascista e la formazione del governo Badoglio a Roma erano confluite
alcune divisioni dell’esercito regio: l’8 settembre viene firmato l’armistizio,
all’alba del 9 settembre il re, Badoglio e le alte cariche militari
abbandonarono la capitale e l’esercito si trovò senza direttive. Una parte di
soldati cercò di contrastare l’esercito tedesco e, insieme a civili organizzati
dai partiti antifascisti, si attesta a Porta S. Paolo dove si resiste finchè la
soperchiante forza militare tedesca ha ragione dei resistenti.

<span>
   Roma cade
sotto il controllo degli occupanti nazisti 
che fra il 1943 e il 1944 sottoposero la popolazione a terrore,
massacri, torture.
  </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
   È in questo
contesto che si inserisce l’azione di via Rasella: in quell’occasione, i Gruppi
di Azione Patriottica riuscirono in una coraggiosa operazione militare che vide
l’assalto a un battaglione nazista che marciava nelle strade del centro,
portando all’uccisione di 33 soldati delle SS. La rappresaglia nazista a questo
evento fu, come tristemente noto, il massacro delle Fosse Ardeatine in cui
trucidarono 335 prigionieri.

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Aptos, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin: 13.2pt 0cm;">
<span>
   Negli anni
diversi sono stati i tentativi di criminalizzare l’azione di via Rasella da
parte dei revisionisti storici - fino all’ “esternazione” di La Russa dello
scorso anno:
  </span>
<span>
<i>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman",serif;'>
</span>
<span>
     «Via Rasella è stata una pagina tutt’altro che nobile della
resistenza, quelli uccisi furono una banda musicale di semi-pensionati e non
nazisti delle SS, sapendo benissimo il rischio di rappresaglia su cittadini
romani, antifascisti e non».
    </span>
</i>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
   Sempre,
coraggiosamente e coerentemente i gappisti protagonisti dell’azione hanno
difeso la Resistenza partigiana e contrastato i tentativi di criminalizzarli.
Essi ci hanno lasciato delle pagine memorabili sulla Resistenza romana.

   Già negli anni del liceo fu un attivo antifascista. Con Leonardo
Jannaccone, Corrado Nourian e Nino Baldini costituì, infatti, nel 1939, un
gruppo detto di "unificazione marxista", che attirò presto
l'attenzione della polizia fascista. Arrestato nel 1941, dopo la scarcerazione
Bentivegna aderì nel 1943 al Partito comunista. Con l'armistizio e la
formazione dei Gruppi di azione patriottica, fu tra i più valorosi protagonisti
della Resistenza, sia a Roma (assalto a militari tedeschi in piazza Barberini,
attacco ad un corteo fascista in via Tomacelli) che nella zona della Casilina,
dove comandò formazioni partigiane.

   Era ancora studente delle Commerciali quando aveva cominciato a svolgere
attività clandestina in "Giustizia e Libertà" e nel Partito
comunista. Dopo il 25 luglio del '43, diede vita, con altri antifascisti
romani, alla formazione "Arditi del Popolo". Il 9 settembre
Fiorentini prese parte ai combattimenti contro i tedeschi a Porta San Paolo e
nell'ottobre del '43 formò e diresse i Gap centrali "

di "Giovanni", operando nella IV Zona di Roma. In questo ruolo
partecipò, nella Capitale, a numerose azioni, tra cui quelle di via Rasella e
al carcere di Regina Coeli. Dopo la liberazione di Roma, si fece paracadutare
al Nord. Col nome di battaglia di "Dino" operò in Liguria, Emilia,
Lombardia e Piemonte, come ufficiale di collegamento dell'OSS, il servizio
segreto americano. È stato decorato con tre medaglie d'argento al valor
militare e tre croci di guerra al merito, e con la medaglia della Special Force

Fiorentini è così diventato docente di Geometria superiore all'Università di
Ferrara. I suoi studi di matematica sono stati ripresi e approfonditi in tutto
il mondo ed hanno fatto dell'ex gappista un matematico di fama internazionale.

   Studentessa di Legge, subito dopo l'8 settembre 1943 partecipò
coraggiosamente alla Resistenza romana, divenendo presto vice comandante di una
formazione operante a Roma e in provincia. Nell'ottobre del 1943 per procurarsi
un'arma (i suoi compagni dei GAP gliela negavano, perché preferivano riservare
alle donne funzioni di appoggio), non trova di meglio che rubare la pistola a
un milite della Gnr, che si trovava vicino a lei in un autobus superaffollato.
Nella primavera del 1944 è tra gli organizzatori e gli esecutori dell'azione
gappista di via Rasella contro un contingente dell'esercito tedesco. L'azione
fu poi presa dai nazisti a pretesto per la feroce strage delle Fosse Ardeatine.
Riconosciuta partigiana combattente con il grado di capitano, è stata decorata
di Medaglia d'Oro al valore militare per aver partecipato, si legge tra l'altro
nella motivazione, "alle più eroiche imprese nella caccia senza quartiere
che il suo gruppo di avanguardia dava al nemico annidato nella cerchia abitata
della città di Roma". Più volte parlamentare del PCI, membro della
Commissione Giustizia nei primi anni settanta, ha fatto parte sino alla morte
del Comitato di presidenza dell'ANPI. Poco prima della scomparsa di Carla
Capponi, "il Saggiatore" ha pubblicato un suo volume sull'attività
dei GAP a Roma. Si intitola

     Lavoratori migranti sfruttati e maltrattati
 nei vigneti piemontesi dedicati al vino pregiato. La denuncia arriva 
direttamente da Al Jazeera, la rete con sede in Qatar. Più nello 
specifico nell’articolo intitolato “Migrant workers exploited, abused in
 Italy’s prized fine wine vineyards”, dove si racconta, tra le altre, la
 storia di
     <b>
      Sajo, un 36enne del Gambia
     </b>
     . Secondo la sua testimonianza sarebbero diversi i lavoratori privi di documenti che lavorano per 12 ore
     <b>
      nei vigneti di Barolo e Barbaresco
     </b>
     (dove
 un ettaro fino a 1,5 milioni il prezzo di un ettaro), per una paga che 
va dai 3 ai 4 euro l’ora. Non solo. L’uomo denuncia anche diversi 
episodi di razzismo, oltre a condizioni di lavoro definite “disumane”.

     Sajo afferma di aver
     <b>
      trovato lavoro ad Alba
     </b>
     ,
 durante la stagione dell’uva, quando occorre nuova forza lavoro. Appena
 sceso dal treno venne avvicinato da un uomo, che gli offrì
     <b>
      un lavoro nei vigneti con una paga di 3 euro l’ora
     </b>
     .
 Accettò e si stabilì in un piccolo accampamento improvvisato che altri

    vignaioli africani avevano costruito nel bosco, sulla riva del fiume. 
Non avevano servizi igienici, né acqua corrente o elettricità. Quando 
non potevano permettersi l’acqua in bottiglia, usavano quella fangosa 
del fiume per lavarsi e cucinare.

     «È stato il momento più difficile da quando
 ho lasciato il Gambia – ricorda Sajo - non riuscivo nemmeno a 
ricaricare il telefono per chiamare casa». Ogni giorno si svegliava 
prima dell'alba e andava alla stazione dei treni,
     <b>
      dove un caporale caricava lui
     </b>
     e gli altri su un furgone e li portava sulle colline fino ai vigneti.
     <b>
      Gli operai erano costantemente sorvegliati
     </b>
     e
 «non potevamo fare pause per andare in bagno o bere acqua. Ci 
minacciavano di licenziarci se avessimo rallentato o avessimo parlato».

  In our long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br/>
  history of class struggle for all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at the same time that
  <br/>
  despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the
  <br/>
  British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the
  <br/>
  success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to
  <br/>
  the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat
  <br/>
  Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we
  <br/>
  have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded
  <br/>
  with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly
  <br/>
  opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including
  <br/>
  Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack
  <br/>
  the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them
  <br/>
  and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.
  <br/>
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br/>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire
  <br/>
  economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
  <br/>
  native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br/>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their
  <br/>
  Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and
  <br/>
  displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to
  <br/>
  face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
  <br/>
  Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure
  <br/>
  was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more
  <br/>
  and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly
  <br/>
  implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to
  <br/>
  the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India,
  <br/>
  Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro-
  <br/>
  imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over
  <br/>
  the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country
  <br/>
  through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and
  <br/>
  communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today
  <br/>
  the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br/>
  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out
  <br/>
  from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has
  <br/>
  abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the
  <br/>
  resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
  <br/>
  India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the
  <br/>
  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green-
  <br/>
  Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous
  <br/>
  people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis
  <br/>
  ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive
  <br/>
  deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from
  <br/>
  the Adivasi region. People's resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are
  <br/>
  being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific
  <br/>
  news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until
  <br/>
  and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid
  <br/>
  on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
  <br/>
  developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the
  <br/>
  people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this
  <br/>
  enemy's machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and
  <br/>
  women's organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists
  <br/>
  to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
  <br/>
  seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the
  <br/>
  treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

<span>
     Nella
 centralissima via Indipendenza di Bologna la polizia oggi ha caricato e
 spintonato gli studenti universitari da giorni in mobilitazione.

<p align="left">

<span>
     Ieri
 a Bologna gli studenti universitari avevano protestato davanti al 
Senato Accademico per chiedere la fine della censura nei confronti di 
chi si mobilita contro la guerra in Palestina, per pretendere il 
boicottaggio degli accordi con Israele ed il comparto militare 
industriale.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-170586 alignleft" height="300" src="https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2024/03/Bologna-universita-Palestina-striscione-300x300.jpg" srcset="https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2024/03/Bologna-universita-Palestina-striscione-300x300.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Il
 Senato Accademico si è rifiutato di rescindere gli accordi in ambito 
militare e bellico, esprimendosi invece con l’ennesima formula vaga e 
fumosa, ribadendo sostanzialmente la necessità di rispettare le 
normative ed il codice etico che, per quanto riguarda il dual use, si 
limita a “minimizzare eventuali danni”…
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Vogliamo
 e pretendiamo un impegno concreto dell’Università che vada a rescindere
 tutti gli accordi con il Gruppo Leonardo, con la NATO e con i partner 
del governo sionista di Israele” hanno scritto in un comunicato gli 
studenti di Cambiare Rotta dell’ateneo bolognese.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Le
 mobilitazioni nel nostro Paese dimostrano che ottenere il boicottaggio è
 possibile e possiamo farlo solo tramite la lotta, come è successo ieri 
al Senato Accademico dell’Università di Torino, dove grazie alla 
mobilitazione si è riusciti ad ottenere la non partecipazione 
dell’Ateneo torinese al nuovo bando MAECI di cooperazione tra Italia e 
Israele”.

<span>
     Ma
 oggi a Bologna è arrivata la Ministra Bernini per l’inaugurazione 
dell’anno accademico e gli studenti si sono mobilitati per farsi 
sentire, anche a luce delle dichiarazioni della ministra contro
     <span>
<a href="https://contropiano.org/regionali/piemonte/2024/03/20/torino-luniversita-cancella-il-progetto-con-israele-0170577">
       studenti e docenti dell’Università di Torino
      </a>
</span>
     che hanno deciso di interrompere la collaborazione con le istituzioni israeliane.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Il
 corteo degli studenti arrivato a via Indipendenza ha cercato di 
raggiungere la sede del Teatro Manzoni dove si svolgeva la cerimonia con
 la ministra Bernini, ma ha trovato a fronteggiarlo uno schieramento 
della polizia che ben presto è passato alle vie di fatto caricando e 
spintonando gli studenti. Il corteo ha ricompattato le file e si è 
diretto in zona universitaria.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
      La
 protesta si è palesata anche all’interno del teatro dove era presente 
un gruppo di studenti con la bandiera della Palestina. Francesca 
rappresentante del Consiglio studentesco, è intervenuta poco prima 
dell’intervento della ministro dell’università, Anna Maria Bernini, con 
la kefiah al collo. “Da mesi assistiamo alla censura sistemica delle 
voci provenienti dalla comunità palestinese e di quelle che sono le 
richieste delle mobilitazioni studentesche” ha denunciato la 
studentessa.

  Trupe NATO pakta, zajedno sa svojim političkim štabovima nalaze se na teritoriji Jugoslavije, rasporedjene u BiH, Hrvatskoj i Makedoniji.
 </p>
<p>
  NATO pakt su stvorili američki imperijalisti u saradnji sa imperijalistima Zapadne Evrope 1947. godine. Zabrinuti zbog velikih pobeda Sovjetskog Saveza, stvaranja socijalističkog tabora, pobeda Crvene armije u Kini i sve moćnijeg antikolonijalnog i antiimperijalističkog pokreta u zemljama Trećeg sveta, stvorili su NATO pakt kao agresivni vojni blok protiv Sovjetskog Saveza, Kine i oslobodilačkih pokreta u kolonijama. Od samog početka svog stvaranja on se formirao kao udarna vojna pesnica koja je trebalo da vojnički pobedi Sovjetski Saveza i druge socijalističke zemlje i da u njima restaurira kapitalizam. Poznate su direktne intervencije NATO­-a u Vijetnamu, Latinskoj Americi i Africi.
 </p>
<p>
  Krajem osamdesetih godina raspao se Sovjetski Savez i raspušten je Varšavski pakt, a zemlje u sastavu Sovjetskog Saveza, kao i zemlje Istočne Evrope likvidirale su socijalizam i pošle putem restauracije kapitalizma.

<p>
  Kada je nestao glavni protivnik NATO pakta – Varšavski pakt, izgledalo je da bi bilo normalno da se raspusti i NATO pakt. Umesto toga, NATO pakt je još više pojačan, preoružan novim, najsavršenijim vrstama oružja i povećani su vojni budžeti članica NATO pakta. Upotrebljavajući ekonomski, diplomatski, politički i vojni pritisak čini sve da se proširi, ne samo na sve zemlje Istočne Evrope, nego i na sve države bivšeg Sovjetskog Saveza i tako dopre do granica Rusije. Cilj im je da na taj način Rusiju potpuno izoluju, stave je na kolena i od nje i zemalja bivšeg Sovjetskog Saveza stvore neku vrstu polukolonija, da nesmetano koriste njihova ogromna prirodna bogatstva, da steknu obilje jeftine radne snage i prostrano tržište. Očigledno je da je NATO pakt ostao i dalje agresivna vojna sila imperijalizma i da čini sve kako bi, ne samo ekonomskim i finansijskim sredstvima, već i vojnom silom NATO­-a osigurao vladavinu imperijalizma u čitavom svetu.
 </p>
<p>
  NATO pakt je reakcionarna vojna sila američkog imperijalizma, najopasniji neprijatelj socijalizma i naroda zemalja Trećeg sveta.
 </p>
<p>
  Zašto su došle trupe NATO pakta u Jugoslaviju?
 </p>
<p>
  SAD i NATO pakt su posle propasti Sovjetskog Saveza ostale jedina supersila, jedina globalna sila u svetu. Jedan od strateških ciljeva SAD i NATO pakta je da ne dozvole da dogadjaji u svetu izmaknu njihovoj kontroli i da počnu da se razvijaju mimo njihovog uticaja ili protiv njih. Oni su nekoliko godina mirno posmatrali rat u Sloveniji, Hrvatskoj, a pogotovo u BiH i nisu smatrali za potrebu da intervenišu. Medjutim, oni su zaključili da bi nastavak rata u BiH neminovno vodio njegovom proširenju na Kosovo, Makedoniju i čitav Balkan i da bi u njega ušle Turska i Grčka,dve važne clanice NATO-­a jedna protiv druge. NATO pakt je tada rešio da pošalje trupe i da zaustavi rat u BiH. Prisilili su Miloševića i Tudjmana da potpisu Dejtonski sporazum.
 </p>
<p>
  Jedan drugi elemenat je ozbiljno uticao da požure sa primenom Dejtonskog sporazuma, kao i namera da reše pitanje Kosova i omoguće duži i stabilniji mir na Balkanu. Žurba SAD i NATO je izazvana mogućnošću da uskoro “eksplodira” Turska, a sa njom čitav Bliski Istok, pa da se, eventualno, nadju u ratu sa čitavim muslimanskim svetom koji sada broji oko milijardu i sto miliona ljudi.
 </p>
<p>
  Kakav je stav Partije rada u vezi sa prisustvom NATO­a na teritoriji Jugoslavije?
 </p>
<p>
  Partija rada smatra da ovo treba razmatrati bez emocija i oceniti da li u sadasnjoj situaciji prisustvo NATO­a koristi ili šteti narodima Jugoslavije. Tim pre što je bilo slučajeva u istoriji kada su se interesi imperijalista, ukoliko se radilo o zajedničkom neprijatelju, mogli podudarati sa interesima naroda. To se desilo u drugom svetskom ratu kada je Sovjetski Savez zaključio pakt sa dve najveće imperijalističke sile tog vremena – SAD i Engleskom radi borbe protiv zajedničkog neprijatelja ­Hitlerove Nemačke.
 </p>
<p>
  U Jugoslaviji je, na žalost, nacionalizam zahvatio široke mase. Velikosrpski i velikohrvatski šovinisti su, u stvari, svojom politikom rata i ugrožavanjem globalnih interesa SAD i NATO-­a prizvali dolazak NATO u Jugoslaviju. Činjenica je da se u Jugoslaviji, baš zbog te široko rasprostranjene nacionalističke svesti, nisu mogle organizovati snage koje bi se suprotstavile pogubnoj, šovinistickoj politici Miloševica i Tudjmana. Činjenica je da nisu stigle trupe NATO-­a i silom svog oružja zaustavile rat, verovatno bi u toku ove dve godine bilo još stotine hiljada mrtvih, novih razaranja i novih zločina.
 </p>
<p>
  Sam čin zaustavljanja rata bio je pozitivan. Nastojanje da se primeni Dejtonski sporazum, osigura jedinstvena BiH, vrate sve izbeglice u svoje domove i da se kazne ratni zločinci, PR smatra interesom naroda Jugoslavije. Primena Dejtonskog sporazuma i rešavanje pitanja Kosova zadaće odsudni udarac velikosrpskoj osvajačkoj ratnoj politici, a i nacionalizmu u Jugoslaviji, koji je bio glavna podloga te politike. Zato PR u ovoj i ovakvoj situaciji za sada nije protiv prisustva NATO-­a, jer je u ovom momentu to u interesu naroda Jugoslavije.
 </p>
<p>
  Ali, ako i posle uspostavljanja mira u BiH i rešavanja ovih osnovnih problema, trupe NATO-­a budu ostale u Jugoslaviji, Partija rada će ih smatrati za okupatore, što će oni stvarno i biti. Tada će PR kao istinski patriotska partija organizovati političku i drugu borbu protiv prisustva NATO­-a, sve do oružane borbe za oslobodjenje zemlje od okupatora.

     Congreso de la CUT del 26 de febrero al 1 de marzo del 2024
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hace unas semanas se realizó el VIII Congreso de la CUT en la ciudad de Bogotá, previo a este, se llevó a cabo el Congreso de Jóvenes y el de Mujeres CUT.
  </p>
<p>
   Pero ambos eventos, tanto el de los jóvenes como el de mujeres, no tuvo un carácter decisorio sino deliberativo, tuvieron además el común denominador de impedir la libre expresión a los trabajadores, sobre todo a los compañeros críticos que venían de otras ciudades y se atrevieron a cuestionar la asistencia de la viceministra de la Igualdad. La intervención de algunos jóvenes fue en el sentido de que ellos pensaban que el Congreso era para hablar de los problemas de los trabajadores y no para hacer politiquería con los funcionarios del Estado. Por esta razón fueron vetados, no solo en la plenaria, sino en las comisiones en las que trabajaron. De igual forma, en el Congreso de la Mujer, no aprobaron la resolución respecto a la defensa del pueblo palestino presentada por la compañera de Van Camps. Es decir, mientras los representantes del Estado burgués, como la viceministra de la Igualdad, sí tuvieron la palabra, a los obreros enviados por los sindicatos que cotizan y mantienen a esa burocracia no les permitieron la palabra.
  </p>
<p>
   Entre tanto, al Congreso de la CUT sí le dieron carácter decisorio y por delegados, con el agravante que llegaron los documentos ya hechos y maquinando para mostrar una mayoría que los aprobaba. Igualmente invitaron a la Ministra del Trabajo y al Viceministro, a pesar de ser criticados por los obreros de base, porque aunque fueron sindicalistas, ahora hacen parte de la las instituciones del Estado que están al servicio de los capitalistas independientemente de sus intenciones.
  </p>
<p>
   Es obvio que, si no le permiten hablar a los que se atreven a criticar, no se está ejerciendo la democracia sindical, y una supuesta mayoría aprueba las conclusiones que ya están maquinadas desde arriba. De esta manera, los nuevos delegados, sobre todo de otras ciudades, creen que esa es la forma de trabajar en el movimiento sindical, desconociendo que la democracia sindical dista demasiado de ser eso, pues a la minoría hay que permitirle defender sus posiciones.
  </p>
<p>
   Es por eso que el sindicalismo, maniatado por la ideología burguesa no le sirve a los intereses colectivos de la clase obrera, hasta ahora solo ha servido para promover a esos burócratas en puestos del Estado, ha servido para que muchos dirigentes conviertan el sindicato en su caja menor, mientras los trabajadores quedan huérfanos y a merced de lo que quieran hacer los patrones con ellos.
  </p>
<p>
   Es por ello que desde estas páginas venimos denunciando esa política burguesa de conciliación y concertación de clases, que precisamente son los fundamentos de la CUT.
  </p>
<p>
   En la declaración política que presentaron como conclusión final del VIII Congreso, se afirma que el aumento salarial aprobado para este año fue un logro. Seguramente ninguno de esos burócratas gana un salario mínimo, ni les toca aguantar el infierno que viven los obreros en la fabricas, ni las afugias y persecuciones que viven los maestros en manos de los rectores reaccionarios, y los empleados de las alcaldías y gobernaciones que sufren la persecución más brutal por los jefes, la mayoría de la burocracia de la CUT ya no siente lo que es vivir con un pírrico salario mínimo. Es decir, estas burocracias no representan a la mayoría como lo hacen saber, y sí engañan y maniatan a los obreros impidiéndoles organizarse con independencia de clase y construir sus propias organizaciones.
  </p>
<p>
   La declaración política de la CUT es solo un discurso más, pero lo que defienden allí es pura demagogia; esa burocracia se ha convertido en una maquinaria que no permite que desde adentro se pueda cambiar, es parecido a un Estado pequeñito, imposible de cambiar porque el Estado desde que se creó tiene como función garantizar los privilegios de las clases que poseen el poder económico, y en el caso de la CUT, desde su nacimiento quedó amarrada por la ideología y política de la burguesía, lo que la convirtió en el engendro que es hoy.
  </p>
<p>
   Es una necesidad inmediata que las organizaciones sindicales dejen de estar detrás de un oficio que pueden hacer las burocracias de las centrales sindicales. El movimiento sindical debe luchar por su organización con independencia de clase y desde las calles, con la denuncia y la protesta arrancarle a la burguesía las reivindicaciones del pueblo; pero es indispensable actuar organizada y centralizadamente, bajo unos principios que representen a su clase, que se vuelva a las huelgas de solidaridad.
  </p>
<p>
   Pero esto hay que trabajarlo a consciencia y con mucho compromiso comprendiendo que las reivindicaciones se resuelven colectivamente, organizados de verdad en federaciones independientes, que sean los cimientos de una verdadera Central Independiente por su ideología y política al servicio de los trabajadores y no de los patronos, una Central que dirija la lucha de los trabajadores en la mejora de sus condiciones, pero no para mantenerse como esclavos asalariados, sino para tener las fuerzas para luchar contra el capitalismo, contra la explotación asalariada y la construcción de una nueva sociedad, el socialismo.

     Sepelio de la mayora Carmelina Yule Paví – 20 de marzo 2024
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p class="has-text-align-right">
<em>
    El día que yo muera, el día que yo no esté en el territorio, ustedes no se queden ahí, no les dé miedo a morir. Después de que estén luchando con sus manos, con su bastón, es el orgullo más grande que pueden tener, no como ellos, que son cobardes que empuñan un arma y con esa arma nos quieren intimidar, pero no, no se dejen doblegar, sean valientes, hablen
   </em>
   «, dijo María Teresa sobre el legado que les dejó su madre Carmelina.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Desde el sábado 16 de marzo se han presentado varios hechos de violencia contra la comunidad nasa en la zona rural del municipio de Toribío (Cauca), allí fue asesinada la dirigente indígena Carmelina Yule Paví, de 52 años de edad, fue herida cuando acompañaba a integrantes de la Guardia Indígena para rescatar a un menor quien había sido reclutado forzadamente por el Frente Dagoberto Ramos del Estado Mayor Central (EMC) de las disidencias de las FARC. Posteriormente la comunidad y la guardia indígena rescataron 2 niñas que habían sido secuestradas. Durante el funeral de la mayora Carmelina, fueron nuevamente víctimas de hostigamiento armado por parte del mismo grupo armado.

    Canción de las mujeres nasa contra el reclutamiento forzado

   </a>
</p>
<p>
   El conflicto armado genera masacres, reclutamiento forzado, es favorecido por la falta de oportunidades en la educación y en lo laboral. El abandono del campo por parte del Estado, lleva a las comunidades rurales a la pobreza; en particular los niños y jóvenes se convierten en carne de cañón, debido a la guerra por la disputa de la ganancia de los cultivos de coca, amapola y marihuana.
  </p>
<p>
   Esta guerra reaccionaria, realizada por los diferentes grupos armados como, los paramilitares, las fuerzas armadas del Estado, las disidencias de las FARC, el ELN y grupos de delincuencia común, ha costado la vida de miles de jóvenes durante décadas y aunque en el nuevo gobierno se promueva el discurso de «Paz Total», la guerra sigue en el campo, apuntando al exterminio de las comunidades.
  </p>
<p>
   Con este accionar queda demostrada la descomposición de las disidencias ya que no cuentan con una base política ennoblecida por el socialismo, que oriente su causa contra los enemigos del pueblo; por el contrario, se han convertido en un cartel más que masacra a su propio pueblo.
  </p>
<p>
   De ahí que sea justa la exigencia a que el gobierno cumpla sus promesas de generar fuentes de empleo, entregar tierras a las comunidades, brindar las condiciones para la educación gratuita y de calidad para primaria, secundaria y universidad.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Las exigencias más urgentes ante dicha situación al gobierno de Petro:
   </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Que el gobierno proteja la vida de las comunidades dentro de los territorios.
   </li>
<li>
    Tras la suspensión del Acuerdo de Cese al Fuego Bilateral y Temporal en los departamentos del Cauca, Nariño y Valle del Cauca. Lo que significa que el gobierno reanuda las acciones militares contra la disidencia de las FARC, es necesario que se dé un reconocimiento a la guardia indígena como gobierno de control territorial de todas las regiones con los derechos jurídicos, políticos estructurales y legislativos.
   </li>
<li>
    Cambiar los cultivos ilícitos por lícitos: que se legalice la producción de los cultivos de coca y marihuana ya que se han convertido en una industria donde las ganancias se la llevan los inversionistas locales y extranjeros y son las comunidades las que ponen los muertos.
   </li>
<li>
    Que se promueva la formación académica universitaria construyendo universidades en los 10 departamentos del Sur Occidente.
   </li>
<li>
    Que se generen fuentes de empleo partiendo de la producción agrícola y minera tecnificada para cuidar el medio ambiente, situación que evitaría la migración de los jóvenes a las ciudades en busca de empleo y sobre todo a no hacer parte de los grupos armados convirtiéndose en victimarios de sus propias comunidades.
   </li>
</ul>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   Rechazamos el asesinato de Carmelina.
   <br>
   No más secuestro de jóvenes, ni reclutamiento forzado.
   <br>
   Abajo la guerra contra el pueblo.
   <br>
   Ni el Estado, ni los politiqueros, Solo el Pueblo Salva al Pueblo.

<p>
  O ministro do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), Alexandre de Moraes, ordenou, na tarde de 22 de março, a prisão preventiva do tenente-coronel do Exército, Mauro Cid, após o vazamento de um áudio em que o tenente-coronel lança criticas contra o ministro, o STF e a Polícia Federal (PF). Os áudios foram publicados na íntegra na manhã de hoje pela revista do monopólio de comunicação, Veja. Pela tarde, Mauro Cid foi chamado a depor no STF e foi preso por “descumprimento de medida cautelar”. O STF ameaça ainda cancelar o acordo de delação premiada, mas deve manter a validade das provas oferecidas por Cid.
 </p>
<p>
  A ordem de prisão de Cid foi cumprida logo após a sessão de delação premiada no dia 22 de março, que durou 1h30. Cid foi acusado de “obstrução de justiça” e de “descumprimento das medidas cautelares”.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  O que dizem os áudios vazados do delator
 </h4>
<p>
  Nos áudios, o tenente-coronel acusa a PF de distorcer suas palavras, tirar as frases de contexto e ocultar alguns conteúdos das declarações intencionalmente. Ele afirma que o STF e a PF tem uma “narrativa pronta” e só querem comprová-la a qualquer custo, e que inclusive foi coagido a falar coisas que não sabia. “Eles são a lei agora. A lei acabou. O Alexandre de Moraes é a lei. Ele prende, ele solta, quando ele quiser, como ele quiser. Com Ministério Público, sem Ministério Público, com acusação, sem acusação”.
 </p>
<p>
  Em outro momento do áudio vazado, Cid afirma que “o Alexandre de Moraes já tem a sentença dele pronta, acho que essa é que é a grande verdade. Ele já tem a sentença dele pronta. Só tá esperando passar um tempo. O momento que ele achar conveniente, denuncia todo mundo, o PGR [procurador-geral da República] acata, aceita e ele prende todo mundo”. Por fim, o tenente-coronel ainda deu a entender que Moraes esconde episódios de 2022: “Eu falei daquele encontro do Alexandre de Moraes com o presidente, eles ficaram desconcertados, desconcertados. Eu falei: ‘Quer que eu fale?’”
 </p>
<p>
  No áudio, o tenente-coronel fez questão também de falar como foi o que mais se prejudicou por conta da articulação golpista de 2022, quase como o que mais se arriscou pela “causa”: “Quem mais se fodeu fui eu. Quem mais perdeu coisa fui eu. Ninguém perdeu carreira, ninguém perdeu vida financeira como eu perdi. Todo mundo já era quatro estrelas, já tinha atingido o topo, né? O presidente teve Pix de milhões, ficou milionário, né?”, disse.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-audio">
<audio controls="" src="https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sequencia-01.mp3">
</audio>
</figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Mauro Cid sai perdendo, Bolsonaro sai ganhando
 </h4>
<p>
  O vazamento dos áudios, nos quais o delator alegar ter sido pressionado pelos investigadores e que as perguntas eram tendenciosas, objetivamente reforçou a posição da extrema-direita e dos aliados direitistas de Bolsonaro. Estes buscam “queimar” o ministro do STF, Alexandre de Moraes, como “parcial” para conduzir o inquérito. Sendo ou não verdade o que disse Mauro Cid, o fato é que a suspeição já está plantada. Isso não significa que juridicamente as provas sejam anuladas agora, mas, politicamente, fica fragilizado um possível mandado de prisão no curto prazo.
 </p>
<p>
  Chama a atenção, no entanto, que Mauro Cid não ganhou absolutamente nada com esse vazamento. O tenente-coronel chegou a passar mal e desmaiar ao receber a voz de prisão. Ao contrário, Bolsonaro sai ganhando. Aliados e a defesa jurídica de Bolsonaro comemoraram o acontecimento, chamando-o inclusive de “gol de placa”.
 </p>
<p>
  É impressionante como, entre os golpistas e fascistas, a deslealdade e a traição florescem como bambus após as chuvas: Mauro Cid, o delator, a que tudo indica, foi traído por seu interlocutor, que vazou o áudio que o prejudicou seriamente. Cid, porém, não pode reclamar: havia entregado informações que incriminavam Bolsonaro para se livrar da prisão. Essa gente entregam-se uns aos outros, sem se importar se eram antigos aliados. Mauro Cid traiu e foi traído. Como escreveu Shakespeare, em
  <strong>
   Júlio Cesar
  </strong>
  : um traidor morre muitas vezes antes de morrer.

  Segundo informações reveladas pela jornalista Denise Assis, do portal Brasil 247, o propósito do ex-comandante do Exército, Júlio César Arruda, ao posicionar tanques em frente ao acampamento bolsonarista no QG do Exército na noite do dia 8 de janeiro – impedindo, assim, a prisão dos “galinhas verdes” – foi proteger a filha e a esposa do ex-comandante, Eduardo Villas-Bôas. A decisão contou com o aceite de Luiz Inácio, que prevaricou junto de Arruda.
 </p>
<p>
  Já era suspeito há tempos que o acampamento em frente ao QG foi usado de base temporária para militares reacionários e familiares que tomaram parte na
  <em>
   bolsonarada
  </em>
  do 8/1, e que os tanques serviram como proteção para sua saída antes da entrada das tropas da Polícia Militar (PM). Na época, a justificativa oficial e que mais repercutiu na imprensa foi que a entrada da PM foi adiada para evitar um “banho de sangue”, uma vez que haviam “galinhas verdes” armados no acampamento que poderiam reagir. No entanto, essa não é a versão real dos fatos.
 </p>
<p>
  A verdade é que o comandante do Exército, Júlio Cesar Arruda, descobriu a presença de Maria Aparecida e Ticiana Villas-Bôas no acampamento e que as mesmas haviam participado da invasão à praça dos Três Poderes. O então comandante do Exército entrou em contato com Gustavo Henrique Dutra, comandante militar do Planalto, para armar o enfileiramento dos blindados na entrada do quartel e impedir a entrada da PM. Dutra recebeu ainda a tarefa de falar com Luiz Inácio, informá-lo e convencê-lo a suspender a ordem. Dutra falou primeiro com o general Gonçalves Dias, então ministro do GSI, e o convenceu a passar para o mandatário. Na conversa, Dutra relatou para Luiz Inácio a presença de Maria Aparecida e Ticiana, alertou o presidente de que havia risco de sublevação caso a prisão das mesmas fosse efetuada, uma vez que a figura de Villas-Bôas é unanimidade na caserna. Luiz Inácio, assim, acatou a ordem.
 </p>
<p>
  Maria Aparecida Villas-Bôas, esposa do ex-comandante, foi uma figura extremamente ativa nas articulações pela ruptura institucional. Ela visitou acampamentos com frequência, chegando a dar a entender em uma das visitas que Villas-Bôas estava com ela e foi até mesmo em uma das reuniões da cúpula militar para discutir o golpe.
 </p>
<p>
  Os fatos revelados explicitam o grau da crise militar na qual ainda está mergulhada a Nação. Afinal, se a simples prisão de familiares de um ex-comandante poderia desatar um processo de ruptura da hierarquia e disciplina na caserna, a única certeza que podemos ter é de que essa mesma hierarquia e disciplina estão extremamente fragilizadas. E, de fato, estão: as tropas não mudaram, tampouco o essencial do comando delas. Quem pode crer que o Brasil está mesmo a salvo de uma ruptura institucional, como sugerem os liberais e oportunistas?

  Na tarde do dia 20 de março, uma manifestação aconteceu no Tribunal de Justiça do Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ). Nesse dia seria realizado o julgamento em primeira instância de Diego Felipe, mototaxista e maqueiro do Hospital Universitário de UFRJ, preso injustamente em julho de 2023 pela PM sob a falsa acusação de transportar um fuzil desmontado, que estava com um passageiro transportado por Diego.

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Na ocasião, o trabalhador ficou dois meses encarcerado em um presídio no município de São Gonçalo e atualmente se encontra em liberdade provisória. Os colegas e familiares de Diego exigem o fim do julgamento contra o mototaxista e denunciando a criminalização do povo preto, pobre e periférico promovida pelo velho Estado.
 </p>
<p>
  A manifestação teve início ao meio-dia e contou com a presença de amigos e familiares de Diego, bem como de organizações democráticas como o Centro Brasileiro de Solidariedade aos Povos (Cebraspo). Na ocasião, os manifestantes ergueram cartazes e ecoaram frases como
  <strong>
   Justiça para Diego
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Mototáxi não é bandido, mexeu com ele mexeu comigo
  </strong>
<strong>
   Trabalhador não é bandido, foi a PM que matou o Amarildo
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Durante as intervenções, os familiares denunciaram o caráter racista das polícias nas constantes prisões e operações arbitrárias contra os trabalhadores moradores de favela, apontando que o caso de Diego não é uma exceção, e sim uma regra em um país onde 44,5% dos presos ainda não foram julgados, segundo dados do Conselho Nacional de Justiça (CNJ) em 2022.
 </p>
<p>
  Os manifestantes denunciaram também os dois pesos e duas medidas utilizados pela justiça do velho Estado. Enquanto processa, prende e criminaliza milhares de trabalhadores inocentes, absolve e deixa em liberdade os policiais militares que matam o povo nas favelas, como ocorreu recentemente com a absolvição dos policiais que assassinaram a trabalhadora Cláudia Ferreira.
 </p>
<p>
  O julgamento do caso de Diego foi adiado para o dia 1 de abril às 14h em decorrência do não comparecimento dos policiais que fazem parte da acusação. A família convida a todos para participarem de outro ato que ocorrerá neste dia às 12h em frente ao Tribunal de Justiça.

   A Nova Democracia reports
  </a>
  that on Tuesday, March 19, the trial of the request for acquittal of the 23 political activists persecuted for their participation in the 2013 and 2014 demonstrations took place at the Court in Rio de Janeiro.
 </p>
<p>
  The trial lasted around 20 minutes and unanimously approved the acquittal of the activists. Outside the court, popular class movements, democratic entities and associations gathered to denounce the political persecution and demand the acquittal of the 23 activists persecuted by the old State for 10 years.
 </p>
<p>
  At the event, in addition to celebrating the result of the trial, speeches were also made against the criminalization of the popular struggle currently underway, defending the people’s right to struggle for their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The case against the 23 began in 2014, with accusations of “gang formation” and “corruption of minors”. The activists were sentenced to sentences ranging from 5 to 7 years in prison. The accusations and arrests linked to this process are part of the campaign of persecution and criminalization of the popular struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  It is worth highlighting that the criminalization of activists and young people who took to the streets to protest also included the participation of the press monopoly, which painted the young fighters as “terrorists” and “vandals”.
 </p>
<p>
  Igor Mendes, among others was imprisoned. He served almost 7 months. Several other people had to remain underground to escape the waves of arrests that were taking place.
 </p>
<p>
  During these 10 years of struggling against the absurd process, the people’s lawyers managed to completely prove the complete farce behind the accusations, which was not supported by evidence but by “testimonies” from undercover agents and other illegalities. that made up a process full of gross flaws.
 </p>
<p>
  The acquittal represents a political victory not only for the activists directly affected but also for all those who struggle, especially the youth, who dared to stand up in the heroic days of 2013 and 2014 against oppression and exploitation of the people. The outcome is also important due to the given current national situation, marked by a profound reactionarization of the State, which has been creating new laws and legal mechanisms to criminalize popular struggle and the right to demonstrate.

The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information.

The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by modifying or adding  to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means. In particular, such measures shall  be implemented in the case of a victim of sexual violence or a child who is a victim or a witness, unless  otherwise ordered by the Court, having regard to all the circumstances, particularly the views of the victim  or witness.  3. Where the personal interests of the victims are affected, the Court shall permit their views and concerns to  be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court and in  a manner which is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial  trial. Such views and concerns may be presented by the legal representatives of the victims where the Court  considers it appropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. The Victims and Witnesses Unit may advise the Prosecutor and the Court on appropriate protective  measures, security arrangements, counselling and assistance as referred to in article 43, paragraph 6. <br/>34 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court5. Where the disclosure of evidence or information pursuant to this Statute may lead to the grave endangerment  of the security of a witness or his or her family, the Prosecutor may, for the purposes of any proceedings  conducted prior to the commencement of the trial, withhold such evidence or information and instead  submit a summary thereof. Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or  inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial.  6. A State may make an application for necessary measures to be taken in respect of the protection of its  servants or agents and the protection of confidential or sensitive information. Article 69   Evidence 1. Before testifying, each witness shall, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, give an  undertaking as to the truthfulness of the evidence to be given by that witness.  2. The testimony of a witness at trial shall be given in person, except to the extent provided by the measures  set forth in article 68 or in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The Court may also permit the giving of  viva voce (oral) or recorded testimony of a witness by means of video or audio technology, as well as the  introduction of documents or written transcripts, subject to this Statute and in accordance with the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the  accused.  3. The parties may submit evidence relevant to the case, in accordance with article 64. The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4. The Court may rule on the relevance or admissibility of any evidence, taking into account, inter alia , the  probative value of the evidence and any prejudice that such evidence may cause to a fair trial or to a fair  evaluation of the testimony of a witness, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  5. The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial notice of them.  7. Evidence obtained by means of a violation of this Statute or internationally recognized human rights shall  not be admissible if:  (a) The violation casts substantial doubt on the reliability of the evidence; or  (b) The admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of  the proceedings. 8. When deciding on the relevance or admissibility of evidence collected by a State, the Court shall not rule  on the application of the State's national law.  Article 70   Offences against the administration of justice 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over the following offences against its administration of justice when  committed intentionally:  (a) Giving false testimony when under an obligation pursuant to article 69, paragraph 1, to tell the truth;  (b) Presenting evidence that the party knows is false or forged;  (c) Corruptly influencing a witness, obstructing or interfering with the attendance or testimony of a  witness, retaliating against a witness for giving testimony or destroying, tampering with or interfering  with the collection of evidence;  (d) Impeding, intimidating or corruptly influencing an official of the Court for the purpose of forcing or  persuading the official not to perform, or to perform improperly, his or her duties;  (e) Retaliating against an official of the Court on account of duties performed by that or another official;  (f) Soliciting or accepting a bribe as an official of the Court in connection with his or her official duties. 2.

The conditions for providing  international cooperation to the Court with respect to its proceedings under this article shall be governed  by the domestic laws of the requested State. <br/>35 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3. In the event of conviction, the Court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, or a fine  in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, or both.  4. (a) Each State Party shall extend its criminal laws penalizing offences against the integrity of its own     investigative or judicial process to offences against the administration of justice referred to in this     article, committed on its territory, or by one of its nationals;  (b) Upon request by the Court, whenever it deems it proper, the State Party shall submit the case to its  competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall treat such cases with  diligence and devote sufficient resources to enable them to be conducted effectively. Article 71   Sanctions for misconduct before the Court 1. The Court may sanction persons present before it who commit misconduct, including disruption of its  proceedings or deliberate refusal to comply with its directions, by administrative measures other than  imprisonment, such as temporary or permanent removal from the courtroom, a fine or other similar  measures provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  2. The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3.

This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4.

The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2.

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  On Thursday, last week, a dispute on land between people from Okuama, Ughelli South, and Okoloba, Bomadi, in Nigeria’s southern state of Delta, took place. The armed forces of the old State tried to intervene but received what they did not expect.

  The soldiers were responding to a call during fighting between some people connected to two rival factions of the feudal landownership. According to local media reports, there have been clashes repeatedly over land ownership in recent weeks, leaving several people dead. One man was abducted during that fighting, with the Nigerian military unable to get the man released.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not unusual that soldiers are sent to resolve conflicts in countryside, which often erupt over land or compensation for oil spills by energy companies in many Delta state communities.
 </p>
<p>
  But this time things went somehow different than usual. It is
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/top-stories/nigeria-16-soldiers-killed-in-delta-state-community-clashes/ar-BB1k5gJ4">
   reported
  </a>
  that when the soldiers from the 181 Amphibious Battalion, responded to a distress call and appeared at the scene, they were surrounded by the local youth and killed at the spot. Among the dead were a commanding officer, two majors, one captain and 12 soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  An investigation has been opened and “a few arrests have been made while steps [are] in place to unravel the motive behind the attack,” Defense Headquarters spokesman Brigadier General Tukur Gusau said in a statement.
 </p>
<p>
  It
  <a href="https://www.herald.ng/residents-flee-as-military-recovers-15-soldiers-bodies-in-delta/">
   has been reported
  </a>
  , that the masses have now fled the area when the army was sent in to recover the mutilated corpses and to take revenge – houses were set ablaze.
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   This incident shows once more the hatred the masses feel towards the ruling big-landlord-bureaucratic system and their repressive forces and on the other hand the impotence of these to prevail the old order, as an expression of the deep crisis imperialism is sinking in.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2.

The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3.

The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

(a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3.

The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3.

This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2.

The Trust Fund shall be managed according to criteria to be determined by the Assembly of States Parties.  Article 80   Non-prejudice to national application of penalties and national laws Nothing in this Part affects the application by States of penalties prescribed by their national law, nor the law of  States which do not provide for penalties prescribed in this Part. <br/>39 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 8.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 (a) and (b), execution of the decision or sentence shall be suspended  during the period allowed for appeal and for the duration of the appeal proceedings.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at the time of the  accused's death who has been given express written instructions from the accused to bring such a claim, or  the Prosecutor on the person's behalf, may apply to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of  conviction or sentence on the grounds that:  (a) New evidence has been discovered that:  (i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially  attributable to the party making application; and  (ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have  resulted in a different verdict; (b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the  conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;  (c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has  committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to  justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46. 2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7.

In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4.

Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State.

The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  We have previously

   reported
  </a>
  on the war in Sudan portraying an initial analysis of the circumstances of the outbreak of the war.
 </p>
<p>
  Nearly one year afterwards the situation is sharpening. It is
  <a href="https://monde-diplomatique.de/artikel/!5987031">
   reported
  </a>
  , that the war-actions dramatically increased, due to massive arming of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) by the United Arab Emirates on the one hand and the “government’s” Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) by Egypt. It is
  <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/03/sudans-forgotten-war-new-diplomatic-push-needed">
   said
  </a>
  , that around eight million people are displaced inside the country as well as being forced to fled into neighboring countries additional to around 3 million refugees resulting from previous conflicts. Half the territory is controlled by either the RSF or the SAF. The government fled the capital Khartoum to Port Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  Negotiation attempts failed or resulted in non-lasting cease-fires. Since these failures international organization focus on the supply with humanitarian aid.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the battle is for centered around El Fasher, the capital of the region North Darfur, after the RSF was able to conquer Nyala, al-Dshunaina and Zalingei three of five regional capitals in Darfur region. In El Fasher around 1.5 million people live, one third being internal refugees. The outcomes of the battle on El Fasher seems to become a turning point in the ongoing war.
 </p>
<p>
  While the burden lies on the masses of the peoples in Sudan, foreigners are profiting. In this aspects one can consider Egypt as the Yankees handyman, while the UAE seems to be a Russian proxy in Sudan, as most

   analysts
  </a>
  do.
 </p>
<p>
  In this sense the development of “DP World” is noteworthy. It was founded 25 years ago by the UAE state monopoly “Dubai World” as a maritime transport company. DP World started in 2016 to construct and run ports in Eastern Africa. First in Somaliland and Puntland, then in Senegal, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In October 2023 DP World took over the port of Daressalam in Tanzania for 250 million US-Dollar.
 </p>
<p>
  The UAE via its DP World was heading for the same port as the Russians – Port Sudan. So the UAE and the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group made up a joint-venture. Wagner transported arms paid for by the UAE with its troops in the Central African Republic to the RSF in Sudan. Since the Prigozhin incident and the restructuring of Wagner – we
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/26/two-years-of-russian-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine/">
   reported
  </a>
  – things became even more complicated. According to Le Mode Diplomatique today two different Russian groups are involved in arming the RSF. But the Kremlin is striving to overcome these issues by its new Africa Corps.
 </p>
<p>
  Due to the difficult situation with Wagner the UAE brought Libyan Chalifa Haftar in to play. Haftar organized air cargo from Bengasi to North-Western-Darfur. Additionally air-drops of weapons with parachutes were delivered.

  relations with the UAE were at an all-time high during his first visit to the Middle East since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Putin praised cooperation between the two countries as he met President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi in early December 2023, describing the UAE as “Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.” For the UAE, the strong ties with Russia is a “calculated risk” it is willing to take, a top UAE official

  On the other side the SAF are supplied via the sea to their residence in Port Sudan by Egypt. Egypt also directly intervened in the conflict, bombarding a Nile-River-Bridge in Khartoum in August 2023. Hundreds of Egyptian soldiers have been captured by the RSF and bombings of RSF positions by Egyptian fighter jets are reported,
  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/egypt-sudan-military-invasion/">
   according to the Atlantic Council
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In this situation the scenario tends towards a complete collapse of central government, what will boost the current explosive situation at the Horn of Africa even more. On the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, the UN Security Council, aware of this situation, adopted a UK-drafted resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan during the month of Ramadan, a sustainable resolution to the conflict through dialogue, compliance with international humanitarian law and unhindered humanitarian access.
 </p>
<p>
  The UN Secretary-General, the UN Security Council, the African Union, and the League of Arab States joined forces to call for this Ramadan truce but Ramadan has started with further fierce fighting. Ali Karti, the Secretary-General of Sudan’s Islamic Movement has now announced that a truce with the RSF will never be accepted.
 </p>
<p>
  On top of the death and misery the war itself causes Sudan is on track to becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis, with around 18 million people already facing acute food insecurity, according to a
  <a href="https://sudantribune.com/article283302/">
   report
  </a>
  by the United Nations. 220,000 severely malnourished children could reportedly die in the upcoming months if they do not receive urgent assistance. A total of some 3.7 million children suffer from malnutrition in Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  The perspective is quite horrible. The UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan is only 4 per cent funded. Both RSF and SAF used hunger as a weapon of war. The RSF has looted humanitarian warehouses and besieged cities. The SAF-controlled Humanitarian Aid Commission has systematically banned movement of lifesaving aid to RSF-controlled areas.
 </p>
<p>
  The recent fighting is very likely to damage the spring harvest, which will increase the hunger even more. Also adequate medical treatment is seldom since prices of medics sky-rocketed by 600 per cent.
 </p>
<p>
  The armed conflict in Sudan, driven forward by the Imperialist puppeteers, will continue to great even more disorder in a region tarnished by war.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2.

A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received.

Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.

In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3.

The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2.

The Prosecutor shall, having evaluated the information made available to him or her, initiate an investigation  unless he or she determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed under this Statute. In deciding  whether to initiate an investigation, the Prosecutor shall consider whether:  (a) The information available to the Prosecutor provides a reasonable basis to believe that a crime within  the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being committed;  (b) The case is or would be admissible under article 17; and  (c) Taking into account the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims, there are nonetheless  substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice. If the Prosecutor determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed and his or her determination is  based solely on subparagraph (c) above, he or she shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  2. If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3. (a) At the request of the State making a referral under article 14 or the Security Council under article 13,  paragraph (b), the Pre-Trial Chamber may review a decision of the Prosecutor under paragraph 1 or  2  not to proceed and mayrequest the Prosecutor to reconsider that decision.  (b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1. The Prosecutor shall:  (a) In order to establish the truth, extend the investigation to cover all facts and evidence relevant to an  assessment of whether there is criminal responsibility under this Statute, and, in doing so, investigate  incriminating and exonerating circumstances equally;  (b) Take appropriate measures to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court, and in doing so, respect the interests and personal circumstances of victims  and witnesses, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and take into  account the nature of the crime, in particular where it involves sexual violence, gender violence or  violence against children; and  (c) Fully respect the rights of persons arising under this Statute. 2.

Article 55   Rights of persons during an investigation 1. In respect of an investigation under this Statute, a person:  (a) Shall not be compelled to incriminate himself or herself or to confess guilt;  (b) Shall not be subjected to any form of coercion, duress or threat, to torture or to any other form of  cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  (c) Shall, if questioned in a language other than a language the person fully understands and speaks,  have, free of any cost, the assistance of a competent interpreter and such translations as are necessary  to meet the requirements of fairness; and  (d) Shall not be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention, and shall not be deprived of his or her liberty  except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established in this Statute. 2. Where there are grounds to believe that a person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  and that person is about to be questioned either by the Prosecutor, or by national authorities pursuant to  a request made under Part 9, that person shall also have the following rights of which he or she shall be  informed prior to being questioned:  (a) To be informed, prior to being questioned, that there are grounds to believe that he or she has  committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (b) To remain silent, without such silence being a consideration in the determination of guilt or innocence;  (c) To have legal assistance of the person's choosing, or, if the person does not have legal assistance, to  have legal assistance assigned to him or her, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and  without payment by the person in any such case if the person does not have sufficient means to pay  for it; and  (d) To be questioned in the presence of counsel unless the person has voluntarily waived his or her right  to counsel. Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

In addition to its other functions under this Statute, the Pre-Trial Chamber may:  (a) At the request of the Prosecutor, issue such orders and warrants as may be required for the purposes  of an investigation;  (b) Upon the request of a person who has been arrested or has appeared pursuant to a summons under  article 58, issue such orders, including measures such as those described in article 56, or seek such  cooperation pursuant to Part 9 as may be necessary to assist the person in the preparation of his or  her defence;  (c) Where necessary, provide for the protection and privacy of victims and witnesses, the preservation of  evidence, the protection of persons who have been arrested or appeared in response to a summons,  and the protection of national security information;  (d) Authorize the Prosecutor to take specific investigative steps within the territory of a State Party  without having secured the cooperation of that State under Part 9 if, whenever possible having regard  to the views of the State concerned, the Pre-Trial Chamber has determined in that case that the State  is clearly unable to execute a request for cooperation due to the unavailability of any authority or any  component of its judicial system competent to execute the request for cooperation under Part 9;  (e) Where a warrant of arrest or a summons has been issued under article 58, and having due regard to  the strength of the evidence and the rights of the parties concerned, as provided for in this Statute  and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, seek the cooperation of States pursuant to article 93,  paragraph 1 (k), to take protective measures for the purpose of forfeiture, in particular for the ultimate  benefit of victims.<br/>27 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 58   Issuance by the Pre-Trial Chamber of a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear 1. At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by modifying or adding  to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3.

This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7.

In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4.

Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State.

The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

           Nun sollen wir ein Jahr auf Kurzarbeit angemeldet werden, das heißt wir bekommen nun zehn Prozent weniger Lohn. In den Nachrichten stand überall, dass wir das angeblich auf freiwilliger Basis machen würden, jetzt müssen wir aber eine Betriebsvereinbarung unterschreiben. In den Nachrichten stand auch, dass es keine Kündigungen gibt. Dennoch mussten jetzt 100 Kollegen, die in Leiharbeit waren, gehen. Insgesamt sind wir 1.000 Kollegen, die jetzt zehn Prozent weniger Lohn bekommen. Unsere Miete, der Einkauf, die Versicherungen werden aber nicht um 10 Prozent billiger!

            Korrespondenzen sind Beiträge aus verschiedenen Teilen der Bevölkerung, sozusagen ein direktes Sprachrohr aus dem Volk. Ihre Gemeinsamkeit ist, dass die jeweiligen Korrespondenten direkt aus ihrem alltäglichen Leben berichten: aus dem Betrieb, dem Viertel, der Familie, der Schule, usw… Als Presse aus dem Volk, drückt die revolutionäre und demokratische Presse nicht nur die Interessen des Großteils der Bevölkerung aus, sondern bindet deren Repräsentantinnen und Repräsentanten auch aktiv ein, gibt ihnen eine Stimme, präsentiert die verschiedenen Meinungen und Ideen aus den Massen um sie miteinander vergleichen zu können und in Diskussion treten zu lassen. Daher finden in der Roten Fahne die Arbeiterinnen und Arbeiter, Stimmen der Jugend- und Frauenbewegung, der Studierenden, der Gewerkschaftskräfte, der Migrantinnen und Migranten ebenso wie der kleinen Selbstständigen und Gewerbetreibenden, Stimmen aus Stadt und Land, eine Plattform und ein Organ. Die Korrespondenten sind keine Redaktionsmitglieder, weshalb sie auch nicht im engeren Sinne an die Blattlinie gebunden sind, sondern “ihre Stimme” zum Ausdruck bringen.

   Εκατοντάδες συγκεντρώθηκαν και ανταποκρίθηκαν στο κάλεσμα των πρωτοβάθμιων σωματείων και των συλλογικοτήτων ενάντια στις διώξεις χθες Πέμπτη 21/3 το απόγευμα στη Πλατεία Δημοτικού Θεάτρου στον Πειραιά. Στις 18:30 ξεκίνησαν οι ομιλίες από εκπροσώπους σωματείων, από διωκόμενους αγωνιστές και από συλλογικότητες.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="white-space: normal;">
<span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
   Στην συνέχεια εκπαιδευτικοί, φοιτητές, εργαζόμενοι και νεολαίοι διαδήλωσαν από κοινού στους δρόμους του Πειραιά και φώναξαν συνθήματα ενάντια στην κρατική τρομοκρατία, τη βιομηχανία συνδικαλιστικών διώξεων, την καταστολή των αγώνων, των σωματείων, το χτύπημα στο δικαίωμα στην απεργία.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Βασικά συνθήματα που φωνάζονταν:
 </p>
<p>
<i>
   «Ούτε βήμα πίσω, καμιά υποταγή, στον δρόμο θα τσακίσουμε την καταστολή
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Κάτω οι διώξεις των εκπαιδευτικών, των φοιτητών, των νέων και των εργατών
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Αυτοί με διώξεις και με τρομοκρατία, εμείς με το λαό για δωρεάν παιδεία
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Φτώχεια διώξεις καταστολή - αυτή η πολιτική μπορεί να ανατραπεί
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Νόμος είναι το δίκιο του εργάτη, του απεργού, του άνεργου και του μετανάστη
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Ακρίβεια ανεργία, ξεφτίλα οι μισθοί, να γιατί χρειάζονται την καταστολή
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Κάτω τα χέρια από τα σωματεία, τους λαϊκούς αγώνες και την απεργία
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Δεν είναι γλάστρες τα σωματεία, στο δρόμο θα τσακίσουμε την τρομοκρατία»
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  Τη διαδήλωση στήριξαν τα σωματεία:
 </p>
<p>
<i>
   ΕΛΜΕ Καλλιθέας – Νέας Σμύρνης – Μοσχάτου, Ε’ ΕΛΜΕ Αθήνας, ΕΛΜΕ Άνω Λιοσίων – Ζεφυρίου – Φυλής, Α΄ΕΛΜΕ Δυτικής Αττικής (Ελευσίνα), Ε’ ΕΛΜΕ Ανατολικής Αττικής, ΣΕΠΕ Πειραιά «Πρόοδος», ΣΕΠΕ «Κ.

</p>
<p>
  Επίσης οι παρακάτω κινήσεις:
 </p>
<p>
<i>
   Ενότητα Αντίστασης Ανατροπής Πειραιά, δημοτικό σχήμα “Ανυπότακτος Κορυδαλλός”, πολιτική οργάνωση Κόκκινο Νήμα, Αγωνιστικές Κινήσεις Εκπαιδευτικών, Λαϊκή Αντίσταση Πειραιά, Αγωνιστική Παρέμβαση Γ΄ Δυτικής Αθήνας, Ταξική Πορεία, Αγωνιστικές Κινήσεις, Εκπαιδευτικός Όμιλος Αντιτετράδια της Εκπαίδευσης, Αγωνιστική Παρέμβαση Νέας Σμύρνης – Καλλιθέας – Μοσχάτου, ΟΡΜΑ (Οργάνωση Μαχητικού Αντιφασισμού), Εργατική Συμμαχία στα Δυτικά, δημοτική κίνηση «Ανταρσία στην Κοκκινιά», δημοτική κίνηση «Ανταρσία στο Λιμάνι», Ταξική Αντεπίθεση, Διαρκής Αγώνας, Πρωτοβουλία εργαζομένων στο ΥΠΑΙΘ.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
<span style="white-space: normal;">
<span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
   Ήταν μια πετυχημένη, μαχητική και μαζική διαδήλωση. Που απέδειξε ότι η απάντηση στο ζήτημα των διώξεων μπορεί και πρέπει να πάρει κινηματικά και κεντρικά χαρακτηριστικά. Άλλωστε η κυβέρνηση και το σύστημα κλιμακώνουν την επίθεση τους, με τον νέο ποινικό κώδικα, το άνοιγμα της συζήτησης για το ξεπάγωμα του νόμου Χρυσοχοΐδη για τις διαδηλώσεις, με το χτύπημα των φοιτητών καταλήψεων και με νέες διώξεις συνδικαλιστών και αγωνιστών.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
  Ο αγώνας συνεχίζεται. Άλλωστε με το τέλος της διαδήλωσης ανανεώθηκε το ραντεβού με τη νέα σύσκεψη Συνδικαλιστικών Οργανώσεων &amp; Κινήσεων- Συλλογικοτήτων- Κινήσεων Γειτονιάς (Τρίτη 26/3 στις 18:30 στο 3ο ΓΕΛ Πειραιά -Μαυρομιχάλη 14-) που θα αποφασίσει τα νέα βήματα που πρέπει να γίνουν.

<p>
  Την  Πέμπτη 21/3  πραγματοποιήθηκε στο κέντρο του  Ηρακλείου συγκέντρωση καταγγελίας των διώξεων αγωνιστών εκπαιδευτικών για την πολιτική και συνδικαλιστική τους δράση στο Πειραιά αλλά και σε  άλλες πόλεις και των 49 φοιτητών του ΑΠΘ.
 </p>
<p>
  Ως Αγωνιστικές Κινήσεις των Εκπαιδευτικών προτείναμε στα σχήματα των παρεμβάσεων  στην πρωτοβάθμια και δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση    να καλέσουμε την ίδια μέρα συγκέντρωση στο Ηράκλειο για το ζήτημα αυτό. Μάλιστα προτείναμε να συναντηθούμε την Παρασκευή 15/3 για να οργανώσουμε όσο γίνεται καλύτερα αυτή την συγκέντρωση. Αυτή η συνάντηση δεν έγινε για διάφορους λόγους. Η ΕΛΜΕ όχι μόνο δεν συμμετείχε   αλλά ούτε καν έβγαλε ψήφισμα. Τα επιχειρήματα των ΣΥΝΕΚ ,της ΠΕΚ και του ΠΑΜΕ  όχι  μόνο ήταν απαράδεκτα   αλλά και γελοία.
 </p>
<p>
  Τελικά χωρίς ιδιαίτερη ζύμωση και ουσιαστική παρέμβαση στα σχολεία,  έγινε η συγκέντρωση. Συμμετείχαν με πανό οι Αγωνιστικές Κινήσεις Εκπαιδευτικών, η Αριστερή Παρέμβαση, η Αριστερή Παρέμβαση Συσπείρωση και η Ταξική Πορεία.   Επίσης δεκάδες εκπαιδευτικοί και εργαζόμενοι ανταποκρίθηκαν. Στήθηκε μικροφωνική, μοιράστηκαν εκατοντάδες  προκηρύξεις και υπήρχε ένα πολύ καλό κλίμα όσο αφορά την ανταπόκριση του κόσμου. Όμως τελικά δεν  μπορέσαμε να κάνουμε διαδήλωση.
 </p>
<p>
  Θεωρούμε ότι οι αδυναμίες μας αλλά και οι δυνατότητες που φάνηκαν αρκετά καλά σε αυτή την κινητοποίηση πρέπει να απασχολήσουν όλες τις δυνάμεις που συμμετείχαμε. Αν το επόμενο διάστημα κινηθούμε πιο αποφασιστικά για το σοβαρό ζήτημα των διώξεων (και όχι μόνο)  το αποτέλεσμα θα είναι πολύ καλύτερο.

 Ετούτη η μέρα είναι καθιερωμένη από τον «ευαγή» ΟΗΕ σαν παγκόσμια ημέρα ευτυχίας. Πράγματι, τόση έγνοια για την ουσιαστική ευδαιμονία της ανθρωπότητας δεν βαστιέται. Θα λυγίσουμε από το υπερβολικό βάρος.  Άραγε το περίσσευμα της αγωνίας των καλών σαμαρείτιδων  που θα το εναποθέσουμε; Μάλλον ας το επωμιστεί  ο πρωτοκάθεδρος των αρίστων (τουλάχιστον στον βαλκανικό νοτιά) Μητσοτάκης, ώστε να ανεβάσει τη χώρα από την 64η θέση (από τις 143 συνολικά) της διεθνής κατάταξης, λίγο ψηλότερα.
 <br>
<br>
 Βέβαια όσο και να μοχθήσει άοκνα ο ευλογημένος (γιατί οπωσδήποτε κάποιοι τον ευγνωμονούν), απίθανο να πλησιάσει τη ζηλευτή τέταρτη (εκτιμήσεις προ γενοκτονίας) του Ισραήλ!!  Επιβραβεύεται όμως η προσπάθεια του, αδιάκριτα τελικού αποτελέσματος.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Έτσι λοιπόν αμολά τους ροπαλοφόρους γενίτσαρους να τσακίζουν στο ξύλο και συλλαμβάνουν  αθρόα φοιτητές, με σκοπό να κλειδώσει οριστικά τη τελευταία επιτυχία θέσπισης ιδιωτικών ανώτατων σχολών. Σαν επακόλουθο της οποίας λίαν συντόμως μέσα σε πέλαγα «ευτυχίας» θα πληρώνει ο λαός για τις σπουδές των παιδιών του (που δεν θα μπορεί δηλαδή) αλμυρότατα δίδακτρα στα δημόσια πανεπιστήμια.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Εξίσου «περιχαρείς» και καθόλου περιδεείς  θα κάνουν οι νέοι το στερνό της ζωής τους ταξίδι «αναψυχής»  με τα ιδιωτικοποιημένα και εκσυγχρονισμένα τραίνα. Θα προσφέρουν τα στρατευμένα αρσενικά το αίμα τους μέσα σε δίνη «αγαλλίασης» στα όποια πολεμικά μέτωπα προστάξει το εθνικό γόητρο και εθνικιστικό καθήκον  αγαστά αγκαλιασμένο (υποταγμένο) με τις ιμπεριαλιστικούς αμερικανονατοϊκούς μακάβριους σχεδιασμούς. Όπως ακριβώς έπραξαν «ένδοξα» οι πρόγονοι σε Κριμαία, Σαγγάριο και Κορέα.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Μέσα σε παραζάλη  «μακαριότητας»  επίσης θα κατακτούν την επουράνια αιωνιότητα αποχαιρετώντας τον μάταιο  κόσμο της ύλης (που το χριστεπώνυμο κηφηναριό της κοινωνίας απολαμβάνει σε μυθικές δοσολογίες) στην πυρά του Ματιού (επίτευγμα όχι άμεσα της τωρινής κυβέρνησης, αλλά οπωσδήποτε συστημικό) ή στους πνιγμούς της νεροποντής. Συντροφιά θα έχουν φυσικά την αθάνατη (κατά θρησκεία) ψυχή των «απρόσεχτων» σκοτωμένων εργατών στα εργοδοτικά κολαστήρια. Εκεί όπου με ασυγκράτητο «ενθουσιασμό» εξουθενώνεται ο πένητας βιοπαλαιστής για την παραγωγική ανάπτυξη του τόπου δίνοντας καρτερικά την καθημερινή μάχη με το μη καπιταλιστικό και μάλλον εξωγήινης προέλευσης  τέρας της ακρίβειας.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Αρκεί μολαταύτα να μην παρασυρθεί από δημαγωγικές, κακεντρεχείς  σειρήνες το διευθυντήριο της ολιγαρχίας λαβώνοντας οδυνηρά  την λαϊκή «ευφορία».  Η οποία πηγάζει  από την  αποκαθήλωση  της καλπάζουσας πολιτικής λαιμητόμου  των κατακτημένων απομειναριών του κράτους πρόνοιας. Με «φρικτή»  συνέπεια αντί της «λαχταριστής»  προσφυγής  στα απογευματινά χειρουργεία να υποχρεώνεται ο λαός σε αναζήτηση  … δωρεάν θεραπείας στα νοσοκομεία και σε βάρος πάντα της ιερής εξοικονόμησης πόρων. Των αναγκαίων δηλαδή  θυσιών για την αγορά αμυντικών  (η οποία άμυνα δίχως αγκυλώσεις εσωστρέφειας εξαπλώνεται θαλερά ίσαμε την Ερυθρά θάλασσα) σύνεργων «ειρηνοποιού»  θανάτου και  αισθήματος ασφάλειας … συριακής ή ιρακινής χροιάς. Τέτοιου μεγέθους μάλιστα γρανιτένια  σιγουριά, παντελώς  ακλόνητη από τους  «αστεϊσμούς» του απειλητικού Πούτιν περί πυρηνικού ολοκαυτώματος.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Το «θεσπέσιο δε κλίμα έκστασης και ανεμελιάς» του λαού εμπλουτίζεται και ολοκληρώνεται  με τα ηδονικά αναφωνητά  δωδεκάχρονων κοριτσιών, ανάμεικτα με «ευγνωμοσύνη» προς τον  μαστροπό τους. Ο οποίος με τη βούλα της ατιμωρησίας του (αστικού) νόμου τα εκδίδει «αλτρουιστικά» στους διεστραμμένους, για να κερδίζουν οι άπορες κορασίδες «ευχάριστα»  τα προς το ζην.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Δεν φτάνει που η απανταχού της γης κυριαρχία κεφαλαίου και ιμπεριαλιστών καταντά γνήσιο εφιάλτη την επιβίωση των εργατολαϊκών μαζών, παρά μας εμπαίζουν  συνάμα ασύστολα. Καθιερώνουν μέρες γιορτής  και βαφτίζουν καθεμιά από  τις 365 μαρτυρικές μέρες του χρόνου με ευφάνταστες ονομασίες. Σε μια υδρόγειο πείνας, πόνου, τρόμου και σπαραγμού.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Ακούς εκεί ευτυχία. Που άραγε και με τι κριτήρια την προσμετρούν οι φυσικοί και ηθικοί αυτουργοί των μεγαλύτερων εγκλημάτων της οικουμένης; Στα κρεματόρια  Γάζας  και Ουκρανίας ή στους σχεδόν εννέα εκατομμύρια νεκρούς σε ετήσια βάση στον πλανήτη από οξεία ασιτία;  Μήπως με τις εκατοντάδες πρόσφυγες στον βυθό Πύλου ή στα 35.000 μνήματα των αδικοχαμένων από την πανδημία μονάχα στην Ελλάδα;
 <br/>
<br/>
 Οι λαοί μια μονάχα αναστάσιμη γιορτή πρέπει να προγραμματίζουν κάθε μέρα και στιγμή. Εκείνη της αντίστασης απέναντι στη βαρβαρότητα και υποκρισία του συστήματος.  Είναι αδύνατον να πανηγυρίζουν ταυτόχρονα όλοι μαζί, αφεντικά και δούλοι. Ή οι τύραννοι θα γλεντούν την ανομολόγητη (επίσημα έστω) παραδεισένια καλοπέραση προξενώντας  στις μάζες ασφυκτικές στερήσεις, απελπισία, στυγνή καταστολή και  πολεμικά  μακελειά ή οι λαοί θα ανασαίνουν ελευθέρα,  γαλήνια,  δημιουργικά, ελπιδοφόρα στις λεωφόρους των αγώνων και επαναστατικών αναμετρήσεων.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Η ευαρέσκεια των λίγων ποδοπατά ανελέητα την ικανοποίηση των συμφερόντων της πλειοψηφίας. Ενώ η ευτυχία των πολλών προϋποθέτει την ήττα και συντριβή των ταξικών  αντίπαλων της μιας χούφτας εκμεταλλευτών. Τίποτα ενδιάμεσο δεν νοείται.

 Η υπουργός Παιδείας της Γερμανίας δηλώνει ότι τα σχολεία οφείλουν να προετοιμάσουν τους μαθητές για το ενδεχόμενο πολέμου, την ίδια στιγμή που το ντόπιο αστικό πολιτικό σύστημα χορεύει στον ρυθμό της ευρωκάλπης του Ιουνίου. Ο πρόεδρος του Ευρωπαϊκού Συμβουλίου, Σαρλ Μισέλ, διακηρύσσει ότι «αν θέλει ειρήνη, η Ευρώπη πρέπει να ετοιμαστεί για πόλεμο» και πως χρειάζεται να «περάσουμε σε λειτουργία οικονομίας πολέμου», ενώ, παράλληλα, τα ξέφτια των πάλαι ποτέ κραταιών αυταπατών και ψεμάτων για την «Ευρώπη των λαών» επιστρατεύονται ξανά από τους κυρίαρχους για να σύρουν τους λαούς τους στην επερχόμενη εκλογική φάρσα. Έτσι και εδώ, ο εγχώριος αστισμός ετοιμάζεται να φορέσει τα «δημοκρατικά» του κουστούμια, την ίδια ώρα που κάνει σχέδια για να ντύσει τον κόσμο της δουλειάς και τη νεολαία στις παραλλαγές, όποτε αυτό απαιτηθεί.
 <br>
<br>
 Γιατί εκεί ακριβώς οδηγεί η αναβάθμιση της εμπλοκής της χώρας στις εστίες αντιπαράθεσης που έχει ανάψει η παρόξυνση του ιμπεριαλιστικού ανταγωνισμού των ΗΠΑ-Δύσης με τη Ρωσία, αλλά και την Κίνα! Η συνάντηση του Μητσοτάκη με τον Ζελένσκι στην Οδησσό, κατά παραγγελία των Αμερικάνων και σε αναζήτηση ρόλων για λογαριασμό της ντόπιας άρχουσας τάξης σε πεδία που ήδη έχει κατοχυρώσει συμμετοχή η ανταγωνίστρια τουρκική, σημαδεύτηκε από τη «συμπτωματική» ρωσική πυραυλική επιδρομή μερικές εκατοντάδες μέτρα πιο δίπλα. Και οι προειδοποιητικές αναφορές του ρωσικού υπουργείου Εξωτερικών προς την Ελλάδα, που ακολούθησαν, αποτέλεσαν μια υπενθύμιση για το μέγεθος των κινδύνων που προκύπτουν από το γεγονός ότι η χώρα μετατρέπεται σε εν δυνάμει «στόχο» στο πλαίσιο της ενδοϊμπεριαλιστικής διαπάλης. Το ίδιο ισχύει και σε σχέση με την όλο και βαθύτερη ένταξη στο μέτωπο της Μέσης Ανατολής, με τη φρεγάτα «Ύδρα» να αναλαμβάνει ενεργό στρατιωτικό ρόλο στην Ερυθρά Θάλασσα στο πλαίσιο της «ευρωπαϊκής» αποστολής Aspides, κόντρα στα drones των Χούθι και προς στήριξη της σιωνιστικής γενοκτονίας του παλαιστινιακού λαού.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  The parties concerned have agreed to continue the four-party Socialist Front of Nepal.
 </p>
<p>
  Top leaders of the CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand and the CPN (Maoist Centre), all participants in the Socialist Front of Nepal, held a meeting at the Prime Minister’s Residence, Baluwatar, on Friday morning. Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma, spokesperson for the Chand-led CPN, said that it had been agreed to continue the Socialist Front and advance the front’s programs.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same meeting, it was decided to try to get the CPN-UML to participate in the Socialist Front of Nepal. “From the beginning, our party was in favor of including other parties including the UML in the Socialist Front. However, due to the previous power coalition, UML was not accepting that,” Bishwakarma said. “Now, the environment has become easier after the change of power. Since they are also in the government, there has been a discussion about getting them to participate in the Front.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the changed situation, the parties have become hopeful that UML will participate in the Front. For this, a team including Chand, who is also the coordinator of the Socialist Front, held a two-hour conversation with UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli on Thursday. Bishwakarma said that Oli appeared positive. “He is positive. However, it is necessary to discuss some issues further,” he said.
 </p>
<p>
  “In today’s meeting, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav have been given the responsibility to further communicate with Oli,” Bishwakarma said.

<p>
  Come già abbiamo denunciato (*), il regime egiziano di Al Sisi sta facendo costruire un recinto nel deserto del Sinai per rinchiudervi i palestinesi in fuga da Gaza, e facilitare così la “pulizia etnica” da parte di Israele, in cambio di finanziamenti del Fmi.
 </p>
<p>
  Il regime egiziano è dominato dai militari, che sono anche tra i maggiori capitalisti del paese. Lanciatisi in affari “faraonici”, come la costruzione della nuova capitale (con enormi profitti per sé e per gli amici), hanno ingigantito anche il debito dello stato e ora il solo pagamento degli interessi sul debito pesa per oltre il 10% del Pil. Soluzione: stampare moneta, quindi creare inflazione, ossia tagliare il potere d’acquisto dei salari per mantenere i profitti dei padroni, privati, di stato e militari.
  <br>
  A settembre 2023 l’inflazione aveva raggiunto il 40%, ossia il potere d’acquisto dei già miseri salari e stipendi aveva subito un taglio del 40%.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Temendo il malcontento per i salari di fame anche tra i dipendenti pubblici, il governo ha decretato l’aumento del salario minimo da 4.000 a 6.000 sterline egiziane (al cambio corrente, oggi 120 euro al mese). Per i dipendenti privati, però, il salario minimo è stato portato a sole LE 3.500.
  <br>
  A gennaio, ai lavoratori che protestavano per i bassi salari, al Sisi aveva avuto la spudoratezza di rispondere: “Non mangiamo? Mangiamo. Non beviamo? Beviamo, e tutto funziona [e qui aveva fatto un osceno, irridente, paragone con la condizione dei palestinesi deliberatamente affamati e assetati dallo stato sionista – ndr.]. Le cose sono costose e alcune non sono disponibili? E allora?”.
 </br></p>
<p>
<b>
   La risposta delle lavoratrici della più grande fabbrica egiziana, il complesso tessile di MISR di Mahalla al-Kubra nel Delta del Nilo, che ha più di un secolo di storia e di lotte, è arrivata il 22 febbraio.
  </b>
<b>
   Scandendo slogan di protesta sono scese in sciopero in 3.700.
  </b>
  Nonostante l’intervento delle guardie per impedire loro di accedere al piazzale centrale, e la scesa in campo del sindacato ufficiale contro lo sciopero, lo sciopero, sostenuto da un sindacato indipendente, si è esteso ad almeno 7 mila lavoratori.
  <br>
  La risposta dei padroni e del governo è stata: bastone e carota. Salario minimo a 6.000 LE (un aumento del 70%), arresto di 13 “leader” dello sciopero (fonte: LabourStart), di cui due ancora detenuti alla data del 13 marzo, sono anche minacciati di licenziamento per assenza ingiustificata.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Evidentemente padroni e governo contano sulla prosecuzione dell’inflazione (ancora al 31% a gennaio 2024), che rimangerà gli aumenti, e gli arresti sono un avvertimento a chiunque, a Mahalla o altrove, venisse in mente di tornare alla lotta.
  <br/>
  Ma lasciar proseguire lo sciopero senza concessioni è sembrato troppo pericoloso al governo: avrebbe rischiato un’esplosione generalizzata perché sa che il forte aumento del costo della vita ha aumentato la pressione tra i lavoratori.
  <br/>
  Un’esplosione che potrebbe collegarsi al sostegno popolare alla causa palestinese che in Egitto c’è, per quanto il regime militare faccia tutto quel che può per non farlo manifestare, e al più generale malcontento per le pesantissime condizioni di lavoro e di vita di milioni di proletari.
 </p>
<p>
  Negli stessi giorni, infatti, sono scesi in lotta anche centinaia di lavoratori di una grande impresa di costruzioni di proprietà del miliardario Talaat Moustafa, in società con la famiglia saudita dei Bin Laden.
 </p>
 Hanno protestato contro il licenziamento dei lavoratori a tempo indeterminato (soprattutto quelli che hanno subito incidenti sul lavoro o si sono ammalati) per assumere lavoratori con contratti precari, e chiedendo il pagamento di arretrati, un aumento salariale per il carovita, misure di sicurezza e dispositivi di protezione sui cantieri, una maggiore copertura sanitaria.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  In questo caso è significativo che le guardie aziendali, che una settimana prima erano intervenute a reprimere una protesta degli impiegati, qualche giorno dopo hanno a loro volta rifiutato di entrare in servizio, lamentando il fatto di essere pagati LE 3000 (60 euro) al mese per 14 ore di lavoro al giorno, e hanno ottenuto un aumento.
 </p>
<p>
  Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa, divenuto un colosso con le commesse per la nuova capitale, sta ora partecipando in società con il gruppo Adq degli Emirati a un progetto da 35 miliardi di dollari per la costruzione di una città turistica sul litorale mediterraneo, su terreni privatizzati dai militari.
 </p>
<p>
  Questi episodi di lotte operaie sono indicativi di una temperatura sociale che sta salendo in Egitto come in altri paesi del Medio Oriente e che potrebbe portare a nuove esplosioni se la crisi economica si aggraverà, in collegamento anche con la rabbia provocata dalla guerra genocidaria di Israele contro la popolazione di Gaza.
  <br/>
  Non a caso il Fmi offre ad al-Sisi miliardi in cambio del lavoro sporco di collaborazione con Israele; mentre da parte loro Meloni e von del Leyen promettono 7,4 miliardi di euro all’Egitto perché faccia il lavoro altrettanto sporco di trattenere gli emigranti verso l’Europa, oltre che per altri lucrosi affari.
 </p>
<p>
  Ci permettiamo di ripeterlo: gli unici veri amici dei palestinesi aggrediti e oppressi da Israele a Gaza e in Cisgiordania sono i lavoratori e gli sfruttati della regione e del mondo, non i governi capitalisti arabi che sfruttano e reprimono i propri lavoratori e sono pronti a fare affari collaborando con le metropoli imperialiste nella repressione di palestinesi e migranti.

   MIGLIAIA DI LAVORATORI SCIOPERANO PER L’AUMENTO DEI SALARI NELLA FABBRICA DI GHAZL AL-MAHALLA
  </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  – di Beesan Kassab, 25 febbraio 2024
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori di Ghazl al-Mahalla sono in sciopero per ottenere salari più alti e bonus più equi.
 </p>
<p>
  Circa 7.000 lavoratori si sono riuniti sabato mattina nella piazza centrale del complesso industriale di Ghazl al-Mahalla per uno sciopero che dura già da tre giorni.
 </p>
<p>
  Chiedono che il loro pasto giornaliero venga aumentato a 30 LE [=0,57 euro], alzando un coro in cui si dice che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
 </p>
<p>
  Chiedono anche l’applicazione di salari più alti, facendo riferimento a un recente aumento salariale per il settore pubblico basato su istruzioni del presidente Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in mezzo a un’ondata inflazionistica che ha fatto salire il costo della vita a livello nazionale. In altri slogan, i lavoratori hanno chiesto: “Dov’è la decisione di Sisi?”.
 </p>
<p>
  La mega-fabbrica di proprietà pubblica impiega decine di migliaia di persone nei settori della filatura, del tessile e del cotone medicale, oltre a una centrale elettrica su un’enorme area di terreno a Mahalla al-Kubra, nel governatorato di Gharbiya.
 </p>
<p>
  Fino a domenica, le trattative dei lavoratori con la società madre sono fallite, ha dichiarato il Centro per i sindacati e i servizi ai lavoratori in un comunicato diffuso sabato sera. All’incontro hanno partecipato un rappresentante della presidenza, dell’Ufficio del Lavoro, del Ministero del Commercio e dell’Industria e il presidente del Sindacato Generale della Filatura e Tessitura.
 </p>
<p>
  Diversi uomini che lavorano nell’azienda sono stati trattenuti sabato dall’Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza dopo essere stati convocati per essere interrogati dall’organismo di sicurezza insieme ad alcune lavoratrici, ha dichiarato la CTUWS, senza specificare il numero dei detenuti.
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori hanno lanciato lo sciopero giovedì [22 febbraio], hanno dichiarato a Mada Masr, iniziando nelle fabbriche di abbigliamento a prevalenza femminile, che storicamente sono state in prima linea in diversi scioperi famosi dell’azienda.
 </p>
<p>
  Hanan*, supervisore di una fabbrica di abbigliamento, ha raccontato a Mada Masr che gli operai del suo edificio hanno iniziato a scandire slogan, interrompendo infine il lavoro mentre i canti si diffondevano da una fabbrica all’altra.
 </p>
<p>
  Contemporaneamente, il personale di sicurezza ha sigillato le uscite per evitare che le donne si riversassero nella piazza centrale del complesso, nota come piazza Talaat Harb. Questa misura di sicurezza è stata applicata anche alla centrale elettrica, secondo Abdullah* che lavora lì.
 </p>
<p>
  Il personale di sicurezza ha sbloccato i cancelli della fabbrica intorno alle 15.00 di giovedì, mezz’ora prima della fine del turno mattutino, per assicurarsi che i lavoratori uscissero dai locali e non si riunissero all’interno, ha detto Hanan.
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori dell’azienda hanno descritto i bassi salari come causa di insoddisfazione.
 </p>
<p>
  Il costo della vita è aumentato in tutto il Paese, con un’inflazione che supererà il 30% nel 2024. Un recente “pacchetto presidenziale”, che sarà varato a partire da marzo, prevede un aumento del salario minimo per il settore pubblico da 4.000 a 6.000 LE al mese, con incrementi che vanno da 1.000 a 1.200 LE per le diverse categorie lavorative.
 </p>
<p>
  Sebbene sia di proprietà dello Stato, la Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, che possiede Ghazl al-Mahalla, non rientra nell’ambito del pacchetto presidenziale, ha dichiarato a Mada Masr una fonte del Ministero delle Finanze.
 </p>
<p>
  I salari dell’azienda sono invece guidati dalle decisioni del Consiglio nazionale per i salari, che lo scorso ottobre ha innalzato il salario minimo del settore privato a 3.500 LE.
 </p>
<p>
  Ma l’aumento di ottobre non è servito a contrastare la riduzione del potere d’acquisto causata dall’inflazione. Dopo più di 25 anni di servizio, Abdel Aziz* ha dichiarato a Mada Masr che il suo guadagno totale non supera i 4.000 LE al mese. La cifra equivale a circa 130 dollari al tasso di cambio ufficiale, o a circa 80 dollari al tasso del mercato parallelo al momento in cui scriviamo.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdullah ha dichiarato che il suo stipendio è di 4.200 LEE dopo 33 anni di lavoro con l’azienda. Hanan, che si sta avvicinando alla pensione, riceve uno stipendio di circa 6.200 LE.
 </p>
<p>
  Diverse fonti di lavoro dell’azienda hanno raccontato che giorni prima dello sciopero, il governatore di Gharbiya aveva effettuato una serie di visite per ispezionare un convoglio che fornisce beni sovvenzionati ai lavoratori dell’azienda.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdel Aziz ha aggiunto che durante la visita di mercoledì, il governatore ha ispezionato un convoglio medico che rifornisce i lavoratori e “un lavoratore ha detto al governatore che il suo stipendio non supera i 3500 LE”.
 </p>
<p>
  Secondo una dichiarazione della CTUWS pubblicata sabato, i lavoratori chiedono ora che il salario minimo sia portato a 6.000 LE, con aumenti salariali in base all’anzianità di servizio e una riduzione degli stanziamenti fiscali.
 </p>
<p>
  Chiedono inoltre che la loro indennità giornaliera per i pasti sia aumentata a 30 LE, per un totale di 900 LE al mese invece degli attuali 210 LE al mese, con un canto che circolava durante lo sciopero in cui si affermava che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
 </p>
<p>
  La dichiarazione del CTUWS di sabato [24 febbraio] ha sottolineato che i membri del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda, affiliato alla Federazione sindacale egiziana allineata allo Stato, hanno cercato di dissuadere i lavoratori dallo sciopero e di intimidirli, ma sono stati espulsi dalla piazza.
 </p>
<p>
  Una figura di spicco del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda ha dichiarato giovedì a Mada Masr, a condizione di anonimato, che il comitato “preferisce la negoziazione allo sciopero, ma sostiene le richieste dei lavoratori”.
 </p>
<p>
  Ghazl al-Mahalla ha agito da catalizzatore alla fine del 2006 per una rinascita dell’azione sindacale a livello nazionale, quando uno sciopero di decine di migliaia di lavoratori della fabbrica si è riverberato in un movimento di scioperi simili in altre fabbriche del Paese.
 </p>

 </p>
<p>
  In uno sviluppo preoccupante, la Sicurezza Nazionale di Gharbia, in Egitto, avrebbe trattenuto almeno cinque dipendenti della rinomata azienda tessile Ghazl El-Mahalla, nonostante la decisione dei lavoratori di disperdere il loro sciopero del 29 febbraio 2024.
  <br/>
  I dipendenti hanno iniziato lo sciopero per chiedere l’applicazione del salario minimo.
 </p>
<p>
  Tra i detenuti ci sono Wael Abu Zuwayed e Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, attualmente trattenuti presso la sede della Sicurezza Nazionale a Tanta. Essi si aggiungono ad altri tre lavoratori, Sabah Ali al-Qattan, Muhammad al-Attar e Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, anch’essi detenuti.
 </p>
<p>
  Wael Abu Zuwayed è stato portato davanti alla Procura della Sicurezza di Stato del Cairo, dove è stato deciso di trattenerlo in custodia cautelare per 15 giorni. È accusato di aver aderito a un gruppo formato in violazione della legge e di aver diffuso false informazioni.
 </p>
<p>
  Con una mossa controversa, il 4 marzo la direzione di Ghazl El Mahalla ha emesso avvisi di licenziamento per i lavoratori detenuti, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed e Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. L’azienda sostiene che la loro assenza dal lavoro è durata dieci giorni, ignorando opportunamente che è avvenuta in seguito alla loro detenzione da parte della Sicurezza Nazionale.
 </p>
<p>
  Il Comitato per la giustizia (CFJ) ha condannato le detenzioni, affermando che lo sciopero è una reazione “spontanea” alle difficoltà economiche dell’Egitto e alla confusione della politica finanziaria. Il CFJ sottolinea la necessità di un dialogo costruttivo e di soluzioni realistiche per affrontare le legittime richieste dei lavoratori, invece di ricorrere alla repressione e all’intimidazione. […]

</p>
<p>
  Oltre a subire le pressioni delle masse per la vile risposta del regime egiziano agli spietati attacchi dello Stato israeliano a Gaza, il presidente “uomo forte” Sisi deve affrontare la crescente rabbia dei lavoratori. L’aumento vertiginoso dei prezzi dei generi alimentari ha colpito duramente i lavoratori egiziani a basso salario, ma ci sono segnali di una ripresa della lotta.
 </p>
<p>
  Circa 14.000 lavoratori tessili della più grande fabbrica egiziana, la Misr Spin-ning and Weaving Company, a Mahalla al-Kubra, nella regione del Delta del Nilo, hanno iniziato una settimana di sciopero il 22 febbraio. I lavoratori di una delle maggiori filiali della società immobiliare Talaat Moustafa Group, la Alexan-dria Construction, al Cairo, hanno protestato il 28 febbraio.
 </p>
<p>
  Sono state le lavoratrici della fabbrica di abbigliamento Mahalla a iniziare a scandire slogan che si sono rapidamente diffusi da un edificio all’altro. Il personale di sicurezza ha bloccato le uscite per impedire che questi lavoratori, così come quelli della centrale elettrica in loco, si riunissero nella piazza centrale. Tuttavia, il terzo giorno, 7.000 scioperanti si sono radunati lì. Decine di persone sono state arrestate. Come di consueto, il comitato sindacale ufficiale gestito dallo Stato ha denunciato lo sciopero, ma i lavoratori li hanno cacciati dalla manifestazione.
 </p>
<p>
  Questo evento riecheggia lo storico sciopero del 2006, quando le donne di Mahalla iniziarono lo sciopero che fu un passo fondamentale verso la rivolta del 2011 che mise fine ai 31 anni di governo del presidente Hosni Mubarak. Nel 2008, la città ha assistito a una rivolta che si sarebbe ripetuta su scala nazionale tre anni dopo.
 </p>
<p>
  […] Lo sciopero è terminato dopo una settimana, in seguito all’intervento del Ministro del settore pubblico. La direzione ha accettato di pagare un minimo di 6.000 LE al mese e la maggior parte dei lavoratori arrestati è stata rilasciata. Un’offerta precedente, che includeva il pagamento degli straordinari, la partecipazione agli utili e l’assicurazione sanitaria, non è stata accettata.
 </p>
<p>
  Protesta dei lavoratori edili
 </p>
<p>
  Centinaia di lavoratori della Talaat Moustafa hanno protestato davanti alla sede dell’azienda. L’azienda ha licenziato lavoratori con contratti a tempo indeterminato e li ha sostituiti con lavoratori temporanei a condizioni peggiori. I lavoratori hanno chiesto pagamenti arretrati, un bonus per il costo della vita, una migliore assicurazione sanitaria e dispositivi di sicurezza nei cantieri.
 </p>
<p>
  Le condizioni dei cantieri sono pessime, non sono disponibili dispositivi di sicurezza e la copertura sanitaria è insufficiente. Molti lavoratori licenziati sono stati feriti sul lavoro o soffrono di malattie croniche.
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori hanno riferito ai giornalisti che i criteri per i bonus e gli aumenti sono oscuri, ma vengono costantemente erogati a persone imparentate o collegate ai dirigenti. I dirigenti e i loro assistenti ricevono benefici sontuosi, mentre le retribuzioni dei lavoratori rimangono basse.
 </p>
<p>
  Insolitamente, la polizia non ha tentato di bloccare la protesta, anche se in passato ha fermato proteste più piccole. Tuttavia, il 4 marzo una protesta dei lavoratori degli uffici è stata impedita quando le forze di sicurezza hanno bloccato i cancelli.
 </p>
<p>
  Ma poi centinaia di guardie di sicurezza dell’azienda si sono rifiutate di iniziare il loro turno! Hanno chiesto salari più alti, migliori benefit, orari di lavoro e ferie. “I nostri stipendi sono molto bassi, pari a 3.000 LE. Lavoriamo per oltre 14 ore al giorno, a differenza del resto dei dipendenti. Riceviamo il bonus trimestrale a una percentuale inferiore rispetto a loro”, ha spiegato una guardia.
 </p>
<p>
  Nel giro di 30 minuti, un alto dirigente li ha incontrati, promettendo di pagare un aumento entro due mesi, dopodiché la protesta è terminata.
 </p>
<p>
  Il regime di Mubarak rimane
 </p>
<p>
  Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa ha avuto enormi contratti per la costruzione della nuova capitale che il presidente Sisi ha supervisionato. Nell’ultimo anno ha triplicato le sue attività nel settore immobiliare e dell’ospitalità, nonostante la crisi economica dell’Egitto. Negli ultimi mesi il prezzo delle sue azioni è salito, facendo guadagnare milioni di dollari al suo multimilionario azionista principale, Talaat Moustafa. Uno degli uomini più ricchi dell’Africa, era vicino al figlio di Hosni Mubarak, Gamal, odiato dai lavoratori per aver spinto una vasta privatizzazione quando il padre era presidente.
 </p>
<p>
  Nel 2008, Talaat Moustafa è stato riconosciuto colpevole di aver pagato 2 milioni di dollari a un ex poliziotto per uccidere la cantante libanese Suzanne Tamim. Gli altri principali azionisti del Gruppo Talaat Moustafa sono la famiglia Bin Laden dell’Arabia Saudita.
 </p>
<p>
  A febbraio, la società ha concluso un accordo di partnership con la società di investimenti degli Emirati Arabi Uniti ADQ per la costruzione di una nuova e vasta città turistica a Ras el-Hikma, sulla costa mediterranea, a ovest di Alessandria. L’operazione da 35 miliardi di dollari, compresa la vendita di terreni da parte dell’esercito, aiuterà notevolmente il governo di Sisi a pagare i 42 miliardi di dollari di debiti e gli interessi che dovrà pagare quest’anno. Molti sono gli interrogativi sollevati, tra cui la fattibilità del progetto, il suo costo ambientale, il vero valore del terreno, come si sia arrivati alla proprietà dell’esercito, quale sia l’opinione dei residenti locali (che non sono stati consultati) e quali controlli ci saranno sui futuri profitti in una “zona economica libera”.
 </p>
<p>
  Il disperato bisogno di valuta estera del governo Sisi lo ha costretto a vendere beni di proprietà dello Stato. Ras el-Hikma si aggiunge alla lista crescente di aziende e terreni egiziani ora sotto la proprietà e il controllo del Golfo.
 </p>
<p>
  Le gravi disuguaglianze, la corruzione e la brutale repressione dell’opposizione del regime dell’ex presidente Hosni Mubarak sono continuate, e persino aumentate, sotto Sisi. I recenti scioperi e le proteste dei lavoratori potrebbero segnare l’inizio di una nuova ondata di azioni della classe operaia, come quella sviluppatasi negli ultimi anni di Mubarak.
 </p>
<p>
  Il risveglio della classe operaia egiziana potrebbe essere un potente fattore per porre fine alla crisi di Gaza, aprire il valico di Rafah agli aiuti umanitari e incoraggiare i lavoratori e i poveri di tutto il Medio Oriente e del Nord Africa a spodestare i loro governanti mega-ricchi in tutta la regione.
 </p>
<p>
  Per porre fine alla povertà capitalista, alla guerra e alla distruzione dell’ambiente è necessario costruire sindacati indipendenti e partiti dei lavoratori con programmi socialisti, democratici e internazionalisti.

   NEWROZ PİROZ BE!
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Newroz is the symbol of the
revolt of the exploited and oppressed peoples against the oppressors
and exploiters in the thousands of years of class societies in our
geography. Today, it has become the name of the rebellion and
resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people,
against the persecution of cruelty, the rebellion of the blacksmith
Kawa against the cruel and massacring Dehaks, and the burning of the
fires of rebellion in all four corners.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   We are welcoming Newroz in a
period in which the attacks and massacres of the cruel Dehaks are
increasing worldwide and in our geography. We are in a process where
the conditions for a new imperialist sharing war are maturing and
preparations are being made for it. The increasing rivalry of the
imperialist bourgeoisie is triggering conflicts and occupations at
the regional level. There are not only rivalries and "trade
wars" between the imperialist blocs. The possibility of direct
military confrontation is also increasing. As Russia's war of
occupation of Ukraine evolves into a "protracted war"  war
between the imperialist camps, some spokespersons of the bourgeoisie
make statements that "we must be ready for war".
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The increasing rivalry between
imperialist monopolies is increasing the aggression of reactionary
forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of
the crisis
   <span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<span>
  for their own interests, to expand their areas of
domination and to hold positions. After the Azerbaijani reactionary
occupation of Artsakh-Nagorno-Karabakh, the attacks launched by
Israeli Zionism, citing the October 7 Flood of the Palestinian
national resistance, turned into genocide. The oppressed Palestinian
people were confronted with a new Nakba (catastrophe).
  <span>
</span>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The Turkish state, one of the
most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression
against the Kurdish nation with daily terrorist attacks on the
territory of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria-Rojava
and invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. It is preparing for a
comprehensive invasion attack to liquidate the gains of the Rojava
Revolution and to eliminate the heavy military losses it suffered in
Iraqi Kurdistan. While liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement, the Turkish state is aiming for occupation and then
annexation in the region. It wants to realize its centuries-old
"Misak-ı Milli" goal with the approval of the imperialists
and with its own collaborator reactionary lines in the region.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   For this purpose, after
negotiations with the reactionary forces of the region, a bargain was
struck at the door of US imperialism. The fascist Turkish Republic's
traditional policy of "taking advantage of the contradictions
between the imperialist camps" is once again in effect. Once
again, preparations are being made to attack the oppressed peoples of
our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the isolation
policy is being implemented on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners,
especially Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrest attacks
against revolutionaries continue.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The reason for this aggression
of the Turkish fascism is not independent of the situation it is in.
The century-old regime of oppression and exploitation is in a picture
of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we have
witnessed in the Earthquakes of February 6, while tens of thousands
of people are waiting for help under the debris, they were faced with
a reality of an enemy of the people who did nothing and prevented
those who go to help. The government, which responded to the people's
call for help from the mouth of R.T. Erdogan himself with the curses
"You're immoral, you're despicable, you're dishonorable";
At the current stage, he is once again asking for votes from the
people. The general elections did not solve the crisis of the ruling
classes and even failed to postpone it. At the current stage, they
are once again struggling for rent sharing, this time on the occasion
of local elections.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   While the ruling classes
continue to fight for rent and cliques within themselves, the poverty
of workers and laborers is increasing. Dozens of workers are murdered
every other day in workplace murders. There is an increase in
massacres and hate crimes against women and other gender identities.
Massacres of nature and the environment for the sake of capitalist
rent and plunder continue at full speed. The policy of annihilation,
denial, assimilation and oppression against oppressed nationalities
and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policies
implemented by fascism to maintain its power have created a situation
of social insanity in which torturous massacres of stray animals are
committed.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Turkish state fascism, facing
this picture it has created with its government and opposition, does
what it knows best, fueling racism and chauvinism, under the name of
"social values", it increases its fascist oppression
against "those who are not like itself" and in reality
against all segments that do not obey it. Sunni Islam, the dominant
belief of Turkish fascism, is used as a means of oppressing different
beliefs and to prevent the working and laboring people from rebelling
against the conditions of hunger and poverty they are forced into.
While the policy of "Prayers for Palestine, Ships for Israel"
is continued with determination, fascist aggression against those who
do not bow their heads continues.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Today's cruel Dehaks are at
work. They continue their robbery, extortion and massacres against
the people of the region, especially the people of our country, for
their own wealth and riches. They are preparing new invasions and
attacks for the survival of their regimes built on corruption and
theft. However, there are and will always be blacksmith Kawas against
the cruel Dehaks.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   It is time to be the
blacksmith Kawa against the cruel Dehaks. Now is the time to resist
and struggle. Now is the time to stand up against the oppressors.

  L’esperienza storica della Comune di Parigi ha provato appieno che è di estrema importanza per la rivoluzione proletaria e la dittatura del proletariato possedere forze armate rivoluzionarie.
  <br>
  Parlando dell’esperienza della Comune di Parigi, Lenin cita un’importante tesi di Engels, ossia che in Francia, dopo ogni rivoluzione, gli operai erano armati; il disarmo degli operai era quindi il primo comandamento per i borghesi che si trovavano al governo dello Stato. Lenin ritiene che in questa conclusione di Engels, “l’essenza del problema, come del resto l’essenza della questione dello Stato (la classe oppressa dispone di armi?), è afferrata in modo ammirevole”.
  <br/>
  La Comune di Parigi nacque durante l’accanita lotta tra la rivoluzione armata e la controrivoluzione armata. I 72 giorni di vita della Comune di Parigi furono 72 giorni di insurrezione armata, di lotta armata e di autodifesa armata. Ciò che provocò un timor panico tra i reazionari borghesi fu proprio il
  <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
  fatto che il proletariato di Parigi aveva impugnato il fucile. L’errore fatale della Comune di Parigi risiedette precisamente nel fatto che essa si dimostrò troppo clemente verso la controrivoluzione e non marciò immediatamente su Versailles, ciò che permise a Thiers di riprendere fiato e di radunare le sue truppe reazionarie per gettarsi furiosamente su Parigi rivoluzionaria. Come disse Engels: “Sarebbe la Comune di Parigi durata un solo giorno se non si fosse servita di questa autorità del popolo armato contro i borghesi? Non si può al contrario rimproverarle di non essersene servita abbastanza?”
  <br/>
<br/>
  Il compagno Mao Tse-tung ha ricapitolato in modo conciso l’importante significato della lotta armata e dell’esercito popolare e ha formulato la famosa tesi secondo la quale “il potere politico nasce dalla canna del fucile”
  <br/>
<br/>
  Egli ha sottolineato: “Secondo la teoria marxista dello Stato, l’esercito è la principale componente del potere statale. Chiunque voglia impadronirsi del potere statale e conservarlo, deve possedere un forte esercito”.
  <br/>
<br/>
  La rivoluzione violenta è un principio universale della rivoluzione proletaria. I partiti marxisti-leninisti devono seguire con fermezza questo principio universale e applicarlo alla pratica concreta dei loro paesi. L’esperienza storica dimostra che là dove il proletariato e i popoli oppressi hanno preso il potere e conquistato la vittoria, essi l’hanno fatto con la forza del fucile, sotto la direzione dei partiti proletari, in conformità delle condizioni specifiche dei propri paesi, costituendo gradualmente forze armate popolari e conducendo la guerra popolare sulla base dell’ampia mobilitazione delle masse nella lotta e ingaggiando ripetute lotte contro gli imperialisti e i reazionari. Ciò vale per la rivoluzione russa, per la rivoluzione cinese e per la rivoluzione dell’Albania, del Vietnam, della Corea e di altri paesi, senza alcuna eccezione.
  <br/>
  Al contrario, quando i partiti proletari non cercano di creare forze armate rivoluzionarie o vi rinunciano, essi causano rovesci alla rivoluzione; esistono serie lezioni a questo proposito. Avendo rinunciato a impugnare il fucile, alcuni partiti sono stati presi alla sprovvista di fronte a un attacco di sorpresa dell’imperialismo e dei suoi lacchè e alla loro repressione controrivoluzionaria e di conseguenza milioni di rivoluzionari sono stati massacrati; in altri casi, poiché volevano ottenere posti di alti funzionari nei governi borghesi o sono caduti nella trappola tesa dai reazionari, alcuni partiti hanno consegnato loro le forze armate popolari, rovinando i frutti della rivoluzione, quando il popolo rivoluzionario aveva già impugnato le armi e le forze armate popolari si erano già sviluppate notevolmente.
  <br/>
  In questi cento anni, molti partiti comunisti hanno partecipato alle elezioni e sono entrati nel parlamento, ma nessuno di essi ha potuto instaurare la dittatura del proletariato con tale mezzo. Anche se un partito comunista ottiene la maggioranza nel parlamento o entra nel governo, ciò non significa che il carattere borghese del potere politico sia cambiato e ancora meno che la vecchia macchina statale sia demolita. La classe dominante reazionaria potrà proclamare non valide le elezioni, sciogliere il parlamento o addirittura ricorrere alla violenza per estromettere i comunisti. Se un partito proletario, invece di svolgere il lavoro tra le masse e di impegnarsi nella lotta armata, sostiene con zelo le elezioni
  <br/>
  parlamentari, esso non farà altro che addormentare le masse e corrompere se stesso. La borghesia compra i partiti comunisti attraverso le elezioni parlamentari e li trasforma in partiti revisionisti, in partiti borghesi. La storia non ci fornisce forse numerosi esempi di questo genere?
  <br/>
  Il proletariato deve conquistare il potere politico con il fucile e deve anche difenderlo con il fucile. Un esercito popolare sotto la direzione di un partito marxista-leninista è il solido pilastro della dittatura del proletariato e il fattore principale tra i vari fattori per prevenire la restaurazione del capitalismo. Con un esercito popolare armato dell’ideologia marxista-leninista, si può affrontare qualsiasi situazione, per quanto complessa possa essere, nella lotta di classe sia all’interno che fuori del paese e difendere il potere del proletariato...

    Il
28 marzo a Budapest, si celebrerà la seconda udienza che vede
imputata Ilaria Salis
   </b>
   in un processo la cui valenza è unicamente
politica. La procura dello Stato ungherese vuole mandare un messaggio
a tutti i movimenti antinazisti e di sinistra europei: non venite a
manifestare da noi, siamo un paese dove manifestazioni antinaziste
non sono ben accette, non siamo un paese che accoglie il dissenso
contro i neonazisti quindi andate da un'altra parte a manifestare, se
venite qui subirete la sorte di Ilaria Salis e degli altri suoi
compagni che in questo momento si trovano incarcerati.
  </span>
</div>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span style="">
    Se
ne è discusso a Torino, durante un interessante incontro organizzato presso la Casa del Popolo Estella, per ricordare quanto sta accadendo, ne ha parlato il padre di Ilaria,
    <b>
     Roberto Salis
    </b>
    , il quale ha ripercorso il dramma giudiziario
che sta vivendo la figlia. Le condizioni disumane di detenzione sia a
livello igienico che a livello di regime carcerario poiché per ben
35 giorni ad Ilaria non è stato concesso il diritto di parlare con
alcuno; la procedura processuale che evidenzia palesi violazione dei
diritti essenziali dell’imputato - ricordiamo che a tutt’oggi ad
Ilaria non è stata data la possibilità di prendere visione delle
prove raccolte a suo carico dalla procura ungherese; tutto evidenzia
la compromissione del diritto di difesa in un racconto che sembra
arrivare da un luogo molto lontano dallo stato di diritto che
dovrebbe caratterizzare gli Stati membri dell'unione europea.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span style="">
    Ed
infatti,
    <b>
     Massimo Congiu
    </b>
    , giornalista, studioso di geopolitica
dell’Europa centro-orientale, ospite del predetto incontro, ha
sottolineato come nella pratica del sistema di potere di Victor Orban
l’idea di giustizia è quella di una giustizia che punisce,
avvilisce, mortifica senza alcun rispetto per la dignità umana, per
la dignità della persona, come effettivamente abbiamo purtroppo
visto con Ilaria. Il sistema di potere di Orban è un sistema basato
sulla paura, fortemente antidemocratico che produce ed afferma una
serie di falsità alcune particolarmente atroci ripetute a mò di
martellamento che determina effetti deleteri sull’opinione
pubblica, ed il prevalere di questa paura genera una giustizia vista
e presentata come qualcosa di cui si debba temere. La commissione
europea ha sanzionato più volte l’Ungheria per violazione dei
diritti umani bloccando anche i fondi destinati a Budapest per
l’ammontare di ben 20 miliardi. Ma vi sono altri aspetti di cui il
governo ungherese si è distinto negativamente e, sempre citando
l’intervento di Congiu, si parla per esempio del controllo che
esercita sulla stampa, del suo impegno a silenziare le voci
dissenzienti, dell’impegno a controllare in modo capillare le varie
manifestazioni della vita pubblica del paese fino alla vita
accademica dell'università. Si pone, quindi, in maniera drammatica
una questione di Stato di diritto in questo paese che Orban
attraverso una sua retorica e propaganda animata da sentimenti
patriottici, ultranazionalisti sta modellando proprio in tal senso
ovvero in termini antidemocratici e la povera Ilaria si trova
incastrata in questo meccanismo.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span style="">
    Il
dibattito è continuato con l’intervento di
    <b>
     Francesca Trasatti
    </b>
    ,
avvocata, osservatrice per il Centro di Ricerca ed Elaborazione per
la Democrazia nel processo Salis, la quale ha subito evidenziato come
la vicenda di Ilaria Salis rappresenti un vero e proprio buco nero
della democrazia politica e del giusto processo. Un trattamento
disumano e degradante che configura una tortura considerato che per
le normative internazionali 15 giorni di isolamento prolungato
costituiscono a tutti gli effetti tortura ed Ilaria ha subìto un
isolamento per ben 35 giorni, ma soprattutto non sta scontando alcuna
condanna bensì solo carcerazione preventiva. Anche la stessa
procedura processuale non garantisce in alcun modo il diritto di
difesa di Ilaria né l’imparzialità di un giudice che ha già
emesso decisione di condanna nei confronti di un coimputato tedesco
nel medesimo processo di Ilaria.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span style="">
    L’Ungheria
di Orban è un’ombra nera antidemocratica che macchia l’Europa,
che in Italia trova sponda nell’amica Presidente la quale si è
fintamente appellata all’indipendenza della magistratura,
all’autonomia dei giudici, ben sapendo che l’Ungheria ha molto da
imparare in tema di  separazione dei poteri e di rispetto dei diritti
umani essenziali.

   in un processo la cui valenza è unicamente politica. La procura dello Stato ungherese vuole mandare un messaggio a tutti i movimenti antinazisti e di sinistra europei: non venite a manifestare da noi, siamo un paese dove manifestazioni antinaziste non sono ben accette, non siamo un paese che accoglie il dissenso contro i neonazisti quindi andate da un'altra parte a manifestare, se venite qui subirete la sorte di Ilaria Salis e degli altri suoi compagni che in questo momento si trovano incarcerati.

   Se ne è discusso a Torino, durante un interessante incontro organizzato presso la Casa del Popolo Estella, per ricordare quanto sta accadendo, ne ha parlato il padre di Ilaria,
   <b>
    Roberto Salis
   </b>
   , il quale ha ripercorso il dramma giudiziario che sta vivendo la figlia. Le condizioni disumane di detenzione sia a livello igienico che a livello di regime carcerario poiché per ben 35 giorni ad Ilaria non è stato concesso il diritto di parlare con alcuno; la procedura processuale che evidenzia palesi violazione dei diritti essenziali dell’imputato - ricordiamo che a tutt’oggi ad Ilaria non è stata data la possibilità di prendere visione delle prove raccolte a suo carico dalla procura ungherese; tutto evidenzia la compromissione del diritto di difesa in un racconto che sembra arrivare da un luogo molto lontano dallo stato di diritto che dovrebbe caratterizzare gli Stati membri dell'unione europea.

   Ed infatti,

   , giornalista, studioso di geopolitica dell’Europa centro-orientale, ospite del

<a name="more">

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
  predetto incontro, ha sottolineato come nella pratica del sistema di potere di Victor Orban l’idea di giustizia è quella di una giustizia che punisce, avvilisce, mortifica senza alcun rispetto per la dignità umana, per la dignità della persona, come effettivamente abbiamo purtroppo visto con Ilaria. Il sistema di potere di Orban è un sistema basato sulla paura, fortemente antidemocratico che produce ed afferma una serie di falsità alcune particolarmente atroci ripetute a mò di martellamento che determina effetti deleteri sull’opinione pubblica, ed il prevalere di questa paura genera una giustizia vista e presentata come qualcosa di cui si debba temere. La commissione europea ha sanzionato più volte l’Ungheria per violazione dei diritti umani bloccando anche i fondi destinati a Budapest per l’ammontare di ben 20 miliardi. Ma vi sono altri aspetti di cui il governo ungherese si è distinto negativamente e, sempre citando l’intervento di Congiu, si parla per esempio del controllo che esercita sulla stampa, del suo impegno a silenziare le voci dissenzienti, dell’impegno a controllare in modo capillare le varie manifestazioni della vita pubblica del paese fino alla vita accademica dell'università. Si pone, quindi, in maniera drammatica una questione di Stato di diritto in questo paese che Orban attraverso una sua retorica e propaganda animata da sentimenti patriottici, ultranazionalisti sta modellando proprio in tal senso ovvero in termini antidemocratici e la povera Ilaria si trova incastrata in questo meccanismo.

   Il dibattito è continuato con l’intervento di
   <b>
    Francesca Trasatti
   </b>
   , avvocata, osservatrice per il Centro di Ricerca ed Elaborazione per la Democrazia nel processo Salis, la quale ha subito evidenziato come la vicenda di Ilaria Salis rappresenti un vero e proprio buco nero della democrazia politica e del giusto processo. Un trattamento disumano e degradante che configura una tortura considerato che per le normative internazionali 15 giorni di isolamento prolungato costituiscono a tutti gli effetti tortura ed Ilaria ha subìto un isolamento per ben 35 giorni, ma soprattutto non sta scontando alcuna condanna bensì solo carcerazione preventiva. Anche la stessa procedura processuale non garantisce in alcun modo il diritto di difesa di Ilaria né l’imparzialità di un giudice che ha già emesso decisione di condanna nei confronti di un coimputato tedesco nel medesimo processo di Ilaria.

<p style="line-height: 16px; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
   L’Ungheria di Orban è un’ombra nera antidemocratica che macchia l’Europa, che in Italia trova sponda nell’amica Presidente la quale si è fintamente appellata all’indipendenza della magistratura, all’autonomia dei giudici, ben sapendo che l’Ungheria ha molto da imparare in tema di separazione dei poteri e di rispetto dei diritti umani essenziali.

     Nella
lunga storia di lotta del nostro movimento democratico popolare, il
23 marzo ha un valore rivoluzionario particolare nel cuore di tutti
quanti si battono per una società giusta e allo stesso tempo
disprezzano risolutamente l’imperialismo. Il 23 marzo i compagni
Bhagat Singh, Sukdev e Rajguru sono stati impiccati dal potere
coloniale britannico per schiacciare il movimento di liberazione
anti-coloniale di allora. La vittoria della rivoluzione bolscevica
aveva influenzato questi tre rivoluzionari indiani che formarono
dell'HSRA (Associazione Rivoluzionaria Socialista dell'Hindustan). Il
compagno Baghat Singh ebbe un ruolo fondamentale nella formazione
dell'HSRA, e affermò chiaramente che quale che sia il colore le
classi dominanti, che siano di pelle bianca, nera o altro, si deve
continuare la lotta contro tutti gli sfruttatori.

     Dopo
l'indipendenza formale nel 1947, l'India è divenuto un paese
semi-coloniale e le classi dominanti indiane, la grande borghesia
compradora e i proprietari terrieri hanno continuato a servire senza
esitazione i loro padroni imperialisti. Tutte le politiche economiche
delle classi dominanti indiane dopo il 1947 sono state concepite al
servizio degli interessi dell’imperialismo e delle élite
nazionali. Le classi borghese compradora  e dei latifondisti,
proprietari della gran parte dei mezzi di produzione del paese, hanno
attuato una politica industriale di sviluppo distorta a vantaggio
proprio e dei loro padroni imperialisti. Scopo sulla politica
industriale era quella soddisfare i bisogni dell’1% della
popolazione delle élites dell’India. Con la penetrazione del
capitale finanziario (sotto forma sia di crediti che di investimenti)
ci sono stati espropri su vasta scala, deportazioni senza precedenti
di popolazioni oppresse. Le masse lavoratrici indiane continuarono a
soffrire uno sfruttamento sfrenato, anche più intenso di prima. Dopo
gli anni ’90, sotto i dettami delle forze imperialiste, le classi
dominanti indiane hanno attuato politiche di liberalizzazione,
globalizzazione e privatizzazione. Misure che hanno dato mano libera
al capitale imperialista straniero di rapinare e saccheggiare le
risorse dell’India e accumularne sempre più profitti. Tutti i
principali partiti politici parlamentari, indipendentemente dal
colore delle loro bandiere, hanno immancabilmente imposto politiche
di globalizzazione, privatizzazione e liberalizzazione. Così hanno
spezzato la spina dorsale dell’economia indiana e causato
l’indescrivibile  miseria delle masse lavoratrici.

     Dopo
la salita al potere di Narendra Modi nel 2014 sotto, il BJP ha fatto
dell’India un campo aperto alla rapina e saccheggio del capitale
straniero grazie a programmi pilota quali “Make in India”,
“Digital India”, “One Nation-One Tax”, “Start-UP India” e
molti altri ancora. Il BJP ha adottato programmi e politiche
filo-imperialiste contro agli interessi delle larghe masse del paese.
Da un lato consegna alle multinazionali straniere le risorse del
paese, dall’altro fomenta i conflitti religiosi, con la sua agenda
di Hindu Rashtra. Il compagno  Bhagat Singh era risolutamente
contrario a ogni politica filo-imperialista o all’ideologia
fondamentalista da cui hanno avuto origine RSS e BJP. Bhagat Singh
era totalmente contrario all'Hindu-Rashtra s all'idea di una nazione
basata sulla religione o razza. Sosteneva le idee del pensiero
scientifico, laiche e socialiste. Oggi invece le forze brahmaniche
Hindutva distorcono le idee del compagno Bhagat Singh per sostenere
il loro progetto di Hindu Rashtra.

     La
crescita economica dell’India significa usurpazione delle terre
degli oppressi. Per uscire dalla sua crisi generale, l'imperialismo
va a caccia delle risorse naturali a basso costo disponibili nei
paesi del terzo mondo. L’India ha abbondanti riserve di risorse
naturali, che si trovano principalmente nelle regioni delle
popolazioni tribali dell’India centrale e orientale. Per
saccheggiare queste risorse, l’imperialismo sostiene ogni attacco
fascista contro le popolazioni indigene dell’India da parte dello
Stato ad esso fedele. Per schiacciare il movimento rivoluzionario
maoista in India, le classi dominanti indiane, in collaborazione con
gli imperialisti, portarono avanti diversi programmi di fascisti
anti-sovversione, come Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operazione Green Hunt,
Operazione Operazione Samadhan, e ora ha lanciato la Operazione
Kagaar. Tutti questi genocidi fascisti di indigeni sono finanziati,
diretti e aspirati dalla finanza mondiale e dal capitale burocratico
compradore. Nel suo stadio di crisi avanzata, l’imperialismo
diventa feroce e in India ha dato origine a un sistema politico
fascista. Nell’India centrale è in corso un i ingente
dispiegamento di forze militari per accelerare il saccheggio delle
risorse naturali dei territori Adivasi. La resistenza popolare contro
il processo si privatizzazione e militarizzazione di villaggi, terre
e foreste è repressa brutalmente dallo stato indiano sotto il
governo del BJP. Ogni giorno i giornali del Chhattisgarh riportano
notizie terrificanti di uccisioni di Adivasi da parte delle forze di
polizia. Non è un fatto nuovo né cesserà fino a quando questo
agonizzante sistema di saccheggio e saccheggio non sarà sradicato
dall’India. La stessa origine del capitalismo si fondò sul
massacro delle popolazioni indigene di Africa e in America Latina.
Nel 21° secolo L’imperialismo ha sviluppato apparati e armi
mortali ancora più brutali per massacrare le masse in lotta. Oggi,
il popolo del'Indiaa (soprattutto dell’India centrale e orientale)
guidato del PCI (maoista) sta combattendo contro queste armi e piani
del nemico.

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

<strong>
</strong>
<br>
  In our long history of people’s democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br>
  history of class struggle for all those hearts that beats for a just – equitable society, and at the same time that despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.
  <br>
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br/>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces, Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India, Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro- imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br/>
  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green- Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from
  <br/>
  the Adivasi region. People’s resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP’S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this enemy’s machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and women’s organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

  Am Donnerstag den 21. März fand eine Veranstaltung im Internationalen Zentrum B5 aus Anlass des 18. März, dem Tag der politischen Gefangen und Jahrestag der Pariser Kommune, statt. Zur Veranstaltung lud das Palästina-Bündnis Hamburg ein.
 </p>
<p>
  Begonnen wurde mit einem kulturellen Beitrag, bei dem Aktivistinnen des Roten Bundes das Lied „Die Frauen der Kommune“ sangen. Dann legten diese die Hintergründen des 18. März als Jahrestag der Pariser Kommune, dar. Es wurden die Hintergründe des Aufstands der Pariser Arbeiter, der die Errichtung der Pariser Kommune zufolge hatte, ihre Errungenschaften und ihre Lehren hervorgehoben. Das neu erschienene Interview mit Professor Saibaba, der kürzlich freigelassen wurde, wurde bekannt gegeben.
 </p>
<p>
  Es wurde auch von Young Struggle zur Lage der politischen Gefangenen in der Türkei und Kurdistan berichtet, den Foltermethoden in den Knästen, Gefängnistypen und erläutert, wie das Gefängnissystem zur Unterbringen der revolutionären Gefangen erweitert wurde.
 </p>
<p>
<img alt="Hamburg Veranstaltung 18 März 2" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/HH/2024/Hamburg_-_Veranstaltung_18_März_-2.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/HH/2024/Hamburg_-_Veranstaltung_18_März_-2.png"/>
</p>
<p>
  Von Vertretern des GefangenenInfo wurden auch zu den Hintergründe der Festnahme von Daniela Klette, was ihr Vorgeworfen wird, wie sie gedemütigt wird und von der Kundegebung die am Sonntag den 10. März in Vechta stattgefunden hat, berichtet, wo Solidarität gezeigt wurde. Die Anmelderin der Kundgebung, ein Mitglied des Betriebsrates im Krankenhaus in Bremen, hat in dem Klinikum, in dem sie arbeitet, inzwischen sogar Hausverbot bekommen. Die Repression gegen diese Person hat inzwischen so absurde Züge angenommen, dass wieder Berufsverbote im Raum stehen, nur für politische Ideen die man hat – also grundsätzlich Gesinnungsjustiz.
 </p>
<p>
  In der Diskussion zeigte sich wieder einmal, in den Zeiten in denen die Massen auf der Welt – vor allem in Palästina in diesem Moment – kämpfen und auch in der BRD in Bewegung sind, wichtige Themen auf die Tagesordnung gesetzt werden. So gelangte die Diskussion schnell zu wichtigen Grundfragen revolutionärer Arbeit und vor allem, ob die Revolutionäre noch weiter warten sollen um den Massen den richtigen Weg zur Befreiung zu zeigen, ober ob sie jetzt in der Praxis zeigen müssen wie dieser Kampf zu führen ist. Kurz: Ob es Missionare braucht oder eine tatsächliche revolutionäre Vorhut.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  KP Sharma Oli, Chairman of the CPN-UML, has dismissed speculations regarding his party’s potential entry into the Socialist Front of Nepal. This came following a discussion with Prime Minister and Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre), Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
 </p>
<p>
  Contrary to earlier reports suggesting UML’s integration into the Socialist Front of Nepal, Chairman Oli clarified the party’s stance, refuting any such plans.
 </p>
<p>
  The decision came after a meeting between PM Dahal and Chairman Oli, where the matter was deliberated upon.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the Socialist Front’s earlier decision to extend an invitation to the CPN-UML, Chairman Oli’s statement firmly denies the possibility.
 </p>
<p>
  The Socialist Front of Nepal, formed on June 19, 2023, comprises four parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand.
 </p>
<p>
  With a collective representation of 54 lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the parties affiliated to the newly established Socialist Front of Nepal have made their presence felt in the political arena.

           Am 24. März jährt sich der NATO-Bombenangriff auf Jugoslawien zum 25. Mal. Der blutige Angriff auf das Selbstbestimmungsrecht der Völker am Balkan zieht seine Folgen bis heute. 78 Tage und Nächte lang bombardierte das Militärbündnis, zwischen 12.000 und 15.000 Menschen wurden dabei getötet. Noch heute profitiert das österreichische Kapital vom Jugoslawien-Krieg.

           Der Jugoslawien-Krieg führte zu einer tiefen Spaltung innerhalb der Völker am Balkan. Unter dem Vorwand der „Friedensförderung“ erfolgte ein Eingreifen der NATO. Der nach dem Krieg geschaffene „Frieden“ bedeutete von da an, ein von den UN-Truppen namens KFOR (Kosovo Force) besetzes Gebiet. Diese Truppen sind eine militärische Formation unter der Leitung der NATO. Die KFOR-Truppe wird von 28 Staaten gestellt und umfasst seit Jänner 2024 4.443 Soldaten. Auch Österreich entsendete seither regelmäßig rund 500 Soldaten. Ab April wird ein Drittel der Kompanie vom Kosovo abgezogen, um österreichische Soldaten für EU-Kampftruppen stellen zu können. Nicht nur, dass die Neutralität damit seit jeher gebrochen wird, so konnte schon von Beginn an die Grundlage für die wirtschaftliche Nutzbarmachung der Balkan-Länder für das österreichische Kapital geschaffen werden.

           Im Februar 2008 wurde die „unabhängige Republik Kosovo“ ausgerufen. Dennoch wird Kosovo vom EU-Rat durch eine Rechtsstaatlichkeitsmission (EULEX Kosovo) geführt. Diese Mission soll unter anderem den Aufbau der kosovarischen Republik bei der Rechtsstaatlichkeit und der Aufrechterhaltung der öffentlichen Ordnung unterstützen. Damit wurde ein Mittel geschaffen, um die Interessen der EU-Imperialisten am Balkan zu sichern. Mit Insitutionen der fadenscheinigen „Friedenssicherung“ wurde so auch das Bestreben zur EU-Osterweiterung gesichert. Von einer „unabhängigen“ Republik kann wohl nicht die Rede sein, wenn der Staat von einer internationalen militärischen Kommission geführt wird und dauerhafte NATO-Stützpunkte im Land vorhanden sind. Das ist der klare Beweis dafür, dass die Imperialisten nicht zur Unterstützung der „Freiheit“ im Land sind, sondern lediglich zur Sicherung ihres Einflusses und ihrer Macht.

           Noch heute sind die Folgen des Jugoslawien-Krieges spürbar. Noch heute profitieren auch die Herrschenden Österreichs von diesem Krieg. Massenarbeitslosigkeit, Korruption, schlechte Lebensbedingungen sind auch heute noch zum Teil die Folgen des Krieges. Die Völker am Balkan protestieren seit Jahrzehnten gegen Korruption, gegen Polzeirepression, gegen die NATO-Stützpunkte und auch gegen die Bestrebungen zum EU-Beitritt. In Kroatien, als EU-Mitgliedsstaat, leidet die Bevölkerung unter anderem an der Einführung des Euros.

  Milano, corteo contro azienda accusata di esportare armi in Israele
 </h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  LaPresse) - Un centinaio di persone hanno manifestato questa sera a
Milano contro la C.A.B.I. Cattaneo, azienda che produce, tra le altre
cose, componenti per mezzi speciali, marini e aerei, accusata dai
dimostranti di fornire materiali all'esercito israeliano per
alimentare la guerra in corso sulla Striscia di Gaza. "Siamo
davanti alla C.A.B.I. Cattaneo perché è una fabbrica di armi,
attiva nella subacquea e sta collaborando con Leonardo Fincantieri
per fornire i mezzi subacquei alla marina statunitense anche a quella
israeliana, nonostante la guerra in corso contro Gaza il genocidio in
Palestina, l'Italia continua a vendere armi", spiega Arturo di
'Milano per la Palestina', "Questa denuncia del mercanto di armi
e delle fabbriche di produzione di armi continuerà. A Milano non c'è
solo questa e adesso ci stiamo documentando e studiando e faremo
altre iniziative". I manifestanti hanno percorso in corteo le
vie del quartiere dietro lo striscione con scritto 'Blocchiamo chi
arma Israele" ma non hanno mai raggiunto l'ingresso dell'azienda
presidiato da alcune squadre di poliziotti in tenuta antisommossa. Il
corteo è poi proseguito e i manifestanti hanno occupato gli spazi
del centro commerciale di piazza Portello dove sono presenti alcune
attività accusate di finanziare Israele e la guerra di Gaza. Sono
stati urlati slogan contro Biden, Macron, Netanyahu e anche nei
confronti del presidente del consiglio, Giorgia Meloni. Ci sono stati
alcuni momenti di tensione con gli addetti alla sicurezza della
galleria commerciale, subito sedati dagli agenti di polizia presenti
sul posto.

Il corteo a visto la partecipazione delle tante realtà della solidarietà alla Resistenza del Popolo Palestinese e delle sue organizzazioni, che ha messo al centro il ruolo complice dell'imperialismo/fascista del governo Meloni al genocidio a Gaza e in CisGiordania. Mettendo in luce l'altra faccia di questa guerra - quella interna -fatta di tagli a sanità, scuola, servizi e repressione delle lotte sociali

<p>
  In the International Military Tribunal, know as the Nuremberg trial, the Soviet Union together with Yankee, British and French imperialism tried crimes of the European Axis, mainly by the Nazis.
 </p>
<p>
  In the
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/nuremberg-tribunal-charter-1945">
   Charter of the International Military Tribunal
  </a>
  , war crimes is defined as follows:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ War crimes: ‘ namely, violations of the laws or customs of war. Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity;”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  In addition the Soviet Union proposed to include crimes against civilians, which were defined in the Charter as crimes against humanity:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ Crimes against humanity: ‘ namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The charter also established that not only the individual directly committing an act is responsible for the crime:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Regarding war crimes we have already
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/19/gaza-famine-is-imminent/">
   reported
  </a>
  on some of the violation of laws of war committed by the State of Israel. With neglecting to provide necessary supplies to the population under its occupation and further blocking other parties from delivering these supplies, in addition to destroying necessary infrastructure such as water wells and poisoning the groundwater with seawater, the State of Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. These acts violates

In addition more than 8,000 people are missing, likely dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings. With this the real death toll is likely closer to 2% of the Palestinians in Gaza. The imminent famine and continuing military attacks against civilians point toward even larger parts of the population being murdered. The State of Israel has also forcefully displaced almost

  </a>
  an estimated 157,200 buildings have been damaged or destroyed. In densely populated areas more than half of all buildings have been destroyed. In northern Gaza almost three-fourths of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. There is no doubt that the State of Israel is committing “
  <em>
   wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity”.

  The mentioned war crimes are also crimes against humanity: “
  <em>
   murder, … deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population
  </em>
  ”. The
  <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf">
   Rome Statute
  </a>
  of the International Criminal Court expands on “
  <em>
   extermination
  </em>
  ” as a crime against humanity:
  <em>
   “’Extermination’ includes the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The State of Israel is not only committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, they are carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. The
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/genocide-conv-1948">
   Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
  </a>
  from 1948, defines genocide as “
  <em>
   any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (a) Killing members of the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  We have already explained how the State of Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily harm, and inflicting upon them conditions of life such as starvation. Since last October Israeli officials have at many times publicly revealed their genocidal intention and have made direct and public incitement to genocide. Many examples of these are included in South Africa’s
  <a href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2024/01/192-20231228-app-01-00-en.pdf">
   application
  </a>
  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for charging the State of Israel for genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made many statements dehumanizing the Palestinian people and called for exterminating them. On the 15
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of October 2023 he
  <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke-start151023">
   stated
  </a>
  that Israeli soldiers “understand the scope of the mission” and stand ready “to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against [Israel] to destroy us”. On the 16

   formal address
  </a>
  to the Israeli Knesset, he described the situation as “a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle”. In his “
  <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/christmas-message-from-pm-netanyahu-24-dec-2023">
   Christmas message
  </a>
  ” Netanyahu stated the following: “we’re facing monsters, monsters who murdered children in front of their parents … This is a battle not only of Israel against these barbarians, it’s a battle of civilization against barbarism”.
 </p>
<p>
  On the 28
  <sup>

  </sup>
  of October, while preparing for the land invasion of Gaza, he
  <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/israel-hamas-war-we-will-fight-and-we-will-win-says-benjamin-netanyahu-12995212">
   stated
  </a>
  : “you must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible. And we do remember”. This referees a
  <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.15.1-34?lang=bi.">
   biblical passage
  </a>
  : “Now go, attack Amalek, and proscribe all that belongs to him. Spare no one, but kill alike men and women, infants and sucklings, oxen and sheep, camels and asses”.
 </p>
<p>
  On the 12
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of October the President of Israel, Isaac Herzog,
  <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2023-10-13/israeli-president-says-gazans-could-have-risen-up-to-fight-hamas">
   stated
  </a>
  the following in a press conference: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.” He has also made
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/173933430267074594">
   handwritten messages
  </a>
  on bombs dropped in Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’
  <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel">
   stated
  </a>
  that Israel was “imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” He has further made the genocidal plan clear by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjHcnNB0E8">
   stating
  </a>
  the following: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”
 </p>
<p>
  On the 10
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of November the Israeli Minister for National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, clarified the government’s position,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1723784790682358189">
   stating
  </a>
  : “[t]o be clear, when we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy — they’re all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.”
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Heritage, Amichai Eliyahu,
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyau.a/videos/148918588283326/">
   stated
  </a>
  the following on the 1
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  of November: “The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes … We must talk about the day after. In my mind, we will hand over lots to all those who fought for Gaza over the years and to those evicted from Gush Katif” [a former Israeli settlement].
 </p>
<p>
  Israeli Army Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (‘COGAT’), Major General Ghassan Alian, stated the following in an official
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5a0EWv-o7mE">
   video statement
  </a>
  addressed to Hamas and Gaza residents: “Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”
 </p>
<p>
  Giora Eiland, Israeli Army Reservist Major General, former Head of the Israeli National Security Council, and adviser to the Defense Minister, has, among many genocidal statements, incited genocide by targeting the water supply,
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5Ow2T0Na20BcoL2yautiobij8ldNsVK/view">
   noting
  </a>
  that water in Gaza “comes from wells with salt water unfit for consumption. They have water treatment plants, Israel should hit those plants.” He has also
  <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sju3uabba">
   stated
  </a>
  that “Israel needs to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, compelling tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Egypt or the Gulf … Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist”. If the genocidal intentions of the State of Israel was not already clear, Eiland makes sure to clarify this by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/TalulaSha/status/1726267178201362438">
   stating
  </a>
  that: “When senior Israeli figures say in the media ‘It’s either us or them’ we should clarify the question of who is ‘them’. ‘They’ are not only Hamas fighters with weapons, but also all the ‘civilian’ officials, including hospital administrators and school administrators, and also the entire Gaza population who enthusiastically supported Hamas and cheered on its atrocities on October 7th.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the facts of the ongoing genocide being clear, the signatures of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, including the imperialists, are obliged to prevent and punish it.
 </p>
<p>
  However, not only are the imperialists negating this obligation, some of the imperialists are also complicit in the genocide. We already
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/10/15/israel-continues-its-genocide-of-the-palestinian-people/">
   denounced

   ban

  <a href="https://samidoun.net/2023/10/statement-germany-announces-ban-on-samidoun-network-we-remain-steadfast/">
   Samidoun
  </a>
  . In France the State has banned pro-Palestinian protests and has used
  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-bans-pro-palestinian-protests-citing-risk-disturbances-public-order-2023-10-12/">
   teargas
  </a>
  to suppress the popular support for the Palestinian people. The British Home Secretary has sent a
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/10/people-supporting-hamas-in-uk-will-be-held-to-account-says-rishi-sunak">
   letter
  </a>
  to police chiefs in England and Wales, stating that waving the Palestinian flag, and shouting slogans such as ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’, may be a criminal offense.” Accordingly German imperialism faces accusations of being complicit in the genocide at the ICJ.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialists have only widened their support for the genocide since this. Yankee President, Joe Biden, is currently working on giving a further

  US-Dollar of military aid to the State of Israel. In January several imperialist cut funding for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) after the State of Israel made absurd allegations against it. This happened just days after the

  that the State of Israel should “take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II” of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.

Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means.

Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or  inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial.  6. A State may make an application for necessary measures to be taken in respect of the protection of its  servants or agents and the protection of confidential or sensitive information.

The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial notice of them.  7.

The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3. Where paragraph 2 applies, any representations under article 75 shall be heard during the further hearing  referred to in paragraph 2 and, if necessary, during any additional hearing.  4.

This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2.

Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4.

Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2.

The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  Thousands of Greenlandic women were involuntarily implanted with IUDs to prevent them from becoming pregnant in the 1960s-1970s by the Danish colonial authorities. This was done to reduce population growth in Greenland – a cruel and cynical expression of population control as part of Danish imperialism’s colonial policy in Greenland.

  During the 1950s to 1960s, the birth rate in Greenland increased by 80%, with 1.781 children born per year in 1966. In 1966, the decision was made by the Ministry of Greenland and the Danish National Board of Health to implant IUDs in 4,500 of Greenland’s 9.000 estimated fertile women, that is 50%. Greenland’s population at the time was around 40.500. The so-called “IUD campaign” reached its peak intensity in the period between 1966 and the 1970s, when the procedures were performed without the consent of young women, some as young as 12 years old. Danish imperialism succeeded in slowing population growth through its cynical abuses, but in 1974 it was forced to abandon the policy. Not because it regretted its failures, but because its policy had succeeded and it feared a backlash in the form of rebellion and criticism of its policy from the UN – several of whose conventions had been violated throughout the process.

  The forced state contraception was carried out during a period when Greenland had formally ceased to be a Danish colony – but still is in practice today. At this time, however, Greenland was still subject to the Ministry of Greenland in the government, which oversaw the introduction of the coercive measures in the so-called IUD Campaign. The abuses were allegedly done so that population growth would not prevent the modernization of Greenland, in other words: not to get in the way of Danish imperialism’s desire to continue its dominance over Greenland. Many people in Greenland do not speak Danish, yet only Danish was spoken in the operating rooms and the doctors were Danes. Many of the girls were not informed that they were being sterilized, both because of the language barrier, but also because it was kept secret from them and their families.

<p>
  Greenland’s population growth has never recovered since the IUD Campaign and the population of Greenland has stagnated since the 1990s.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the policy was officially abandoned in 1974, it was unofficially continued for many years. In 1992, the local authorities in Greenland took over the health sector, where the policy continued with a further 14 Greenlandic women having IUDs implanted without consent.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  The abuse has caused permanent damage to many women today, who experience many discomforts such as pelvic inflammatory disease, severe pain, irregular bleeding and permanent tissue damage and sterilization. The IUDs used at the time were of the Lippes Loop type and were much larger than those used today, and were only intended for women who had already given birth before. For this reason, among others, the IUD has led to permanent trauma in many women’s abdomens after being in place for decades.
 </p>
<p>
  Involuntary contraception is not just a thing of the distant past either. In an interview with 4 Greenlandic women, the British media BBC has revealed how at least 4 cases of involuntary birth control have been known to have been carried out by the authorities in Greenland since the turn of the millennium. Information has also
  <a href="">
   reported
  </a>
  on at least three involuntary induced abortions performed by the authorities in 2004, 2010 and 2013.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, 143 Greenlandic women are suing the Danish state, seeking compensation of 300.000 DKK [Note by translator: around 44.000 USD] each for their suffering. This case is currently receiving a lot of media attention. The bourgeois Danish state and the authorities in Greenland are currently using the case as part of a “historical investigation of the Danish-Greenlandic history”, 45 million DKK [Note by translator: around 6,5 million USD] has been allocated by the state for this purpose. This investigation is part of the ongoing process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands to go from colonies to semi-colonies. Danish imperialism therefore needs to admit many of its crimes and come clean about them in order to continue its exploitation of Greenland and its strategic position in the Arctic.
 </p>
<p>
  The transition from colony to semi-colony for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should be understood as a deliberate act of Danish imperialism. It is a way for it to refine its exploitation of the countries, as this is more stable than the official colonial form. At the same time, it is an expression of the fact that revolution is the main trend in the world today, it is a sign of the decay of imperialism and the collapse of the last remnants of the colonial system in the world. Danish imperialism has learned the lessons of the people’s anti-colonial struggles in mainly Africa and Asia and has chosen to stay ahead of them by dictating the process itself. The inter-imperialist contradictions must also be taken into account, with mainly Yankee imperialism taking a renewed interest in the Arctic in its struggle against Russian imperialism. At the same time, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has now attracted the attention of other imperialists who want to develop mining in Greenland.
 </p>

</figure>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should therefore be understood as a sign of weakness for Danish imperialism and imperialism in general, which is no longer able to maintain colonies, and that the masses in Greenland and the Faroe Islands defiantly continue to combat and resist.

Description: SpaceX is building network of spy satellites called ”Starshield” under a classified contract with the US government. SpaceX has a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which includes personnel from the CIA and the Space Forces, to build a network of satellites able to quickly single out military targets almost anywhere in the world to support the ground forces of US imperialism.

  network of spy satellites called ”Starshield” under a classified contract with the US government. SpaceX has a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which includes personnel from the CIA and the Space Forces, to build a network of satellites able to quickly single out military targets almost anywhere in the world to support the ground forces of US imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  “The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,” a spokesperson for the NRO described the system. According to sources close to the project, the system would be so extensive that ”no one could hide”. The spy system would consist of low-orbiting satellites able to provide the US military with detailed images of the Earth, and it would also be

   more immun
  </a>
  e to disruptions, which the US says especially Russian imperialism would attempt to cause to its satellites. This system would provide information faster and near-constantly compared to old-type of higher-orbiting satellites.
 </p>
<p>
  Chinese social-imperialism has its own aspirations regarding the militarization of space, and its own spy satellite network program, and it immediately
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/world/china-s-military-state-media-slam-u-s-after-reuters-report-on-spacex-spy-satellites/ar-BB1k54mu">
   expressed
  </a>
  its concern over ”Starshield” and accused the US of escalating tensions and threatening “global security”. Russian imperialism
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/russia-warns-united-states-use-of-spacex-for-spying-makes-its-satellites-a-target/ar-BB1kdw8l">
   warned
  </a>
  the US that through using commercial satellites for military purposes, these satellites become legitimate military targets.
 </p>
<p>
  In one hand, as is highlighted in the mainstream media, Starshield reflects the US asserting its position as the sole hegemonic superpower over Russian imperialism, as well as Chinese social-imperialism, with a massive militarization of space, using the most advanced new technologies. In the other hand, and mainly, corresponding to the main contradiction in the world today, it is spearheaded against the oppressed nations, in order to increase repression against their struggle for liberation, “so that no one can hide” from the all-seeing eye of Yankee imperialism. Here it is necessary to note however that even though imperialists highlight how advanced, how “omnipotent” this technology is, faced with the peoples of the world it is only a paper tiger.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2021, the US Department of Defense (DoD) officials
  <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2629675/space-based-capabilities-critical-to-us-national-security-dod-officials-say/">
   said
  </a>
  that space-based capabilities are critical for the US and that the US has to be prepared to conflicts which extent to space or even originate there, not meaning that war would be waged in space but that space would play a role in armed conflicts on Earth. In this context, DoD described as the main threat the space aspirations of Russian imperialism and Chinese social-imperialism: “Russia and China view space as critical to modern warfare and consider the use of counterspace capabilities as both a means of reducing U.S. military effectiveness and winning future wars”, DoD principal director for space policy said.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX is the largest operator of satellites in the world. The first SpaceX satellite was developed under a contract with the US, and its Falcon 9 rockets have been used to transport US military payloads to space. Already before Starshield SpaceX had aspirations to sell its Starlink technology to the US Department of Defense, but what the US imperialism wanted was technology specifically engineered to meet its needs.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX has already around 5,500 commercial Starlink satellites orbiting the Earth. These provide internet for different actors, and it is used among others by the Ukrainian military for communications. SpaceX sent 22,000 Starlink terminals to Ukraine in the first year since the beginning of the war of aggression, and they have played a “significant role”
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/10/europe/ukraine-starlink-not-active-crimea-intl-hnk/index.html">
   according
  </a>
  to Ukrainian military sources. This was the first major conflict where such commercial space technology has been used for military purposes in a significant way and some US experts describe that such integration of commercial space technology for military operations is the “way of the future”. The space played already a role in for example the Gulf war, and satellites are commonly used in warfare and intelligence all over the world, but with the war of aggression against Ukraine the use of a commercial service is noteworthy. According to the CEO of SpaceX Elon Musk, who likes to pretend he is a “scientist” working for the good of the human kind, claims that the terminals were provided to Ukraine for “humanitarian” purposes and not military purposes. In 2023 it was also claimed that Musk ordered some connections to be shut down near Crimea to sabotage a Ukrainian attack against Russian warships because he was afraid of Russia reacting with nuclear weapons. In 2024, the Ukrainian military
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/house-democrats-probe-spacex-over-alleged-illegal-export-and-use-of-starlink-by-russia/ar-BB1jvI9P">
   said
  </a>
  it has evidence Starlink has been used also by Russia. The war of aggression in Ukraine has therefore in one hand served to refine the technology for military purposes, and in the other it has shown the capabilities of such technology and the “necessity” of the increasing militarization of space for the imperialists. Therefore it has raised the interest of US imperialism to ensure such technology serves its interests only and can be used extensively for this – and to this the Starshield system answers.
 </p>
<p>
  It is
  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/airpower-after-ukraine/commercial-satellites-are-on-the-front-lines-of-war-today-heres-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-warfare/">
   claimed
  </a>
  that as the costs of launching satellites and rockets to space lower and more and more commercial companies pop up, it “democratizes” the space. This is of course a similar machination as the free competition and “the American dream” under capitalism, that today has reached the stage of imperialism, and the tendency of monopolization and struggle for hegemony is seen also in space and this commercialization of space is used by the imperialists to achieve their interests. It is openly stated by US experts that using commercial technologies for military purposes is the future, and companies are put to develop military technologies in close contact with the US government. Trae Stephens, a principal at Founders Fund, whose investments include SpaceX, said in 2023 that the war of aggression has woken up members of the financial oligarchy to see the potential in military technologies instead of civilian infrastructure. This means deeper militarization of society.
 </p>
<p>
  As the general crisis of imperialism develops further and further, it becomes more and more urgent for the imperialists to develop all-encompassing militarization, that even reaches space. Technological advancement is put to serve destruction and the maintaining of oppression, the hegemony of the US imperialism in the world. This is a sign of weakness, and as has been seen multiple times, despite its technological overpower, it has experienced and keeps on experiencing devastating blows from the peoples of the world.

<p>
  18. maaliskuuta, noin 100 LCP:n järjestämää maatilojen valloittajaa Jaqueirassa, Pernambucossa (PE) sijaitsevista yhteisöistä (Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabugi, Monteir, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa D’agua, Tenório ja Sítio Grande) yhdistivät voimansa palauttaakseen vesilähteensä, joita piiritti suurtilallisyritys Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A, jonka omistaa tilanherra Guilherme Maranhão.
 </p>
<p>
  Vuodesta 2015, kun maiden ja vesilähteiden ryöstö alkoi, talonpojat ovat eläneet ja tuottaneet entisen Frei Caneca -tilan mailla. Tilanherra Guilherme Maranhãp, jota tukee entinen kuvernööri Paulo Camara, asetti pyssymiesryhmiä jotka uhkailevat koko väestöä laajentaakseen nautakarjankasvatusta kansainväliseen vientiin Masterboin teurastamon kautta.
 </p>
<p>
  Huolimatta kattavasta todistusaineistosta veden myrkytyksestä tilanherrojen päästämillä tuholaismyrkyillä (karjan paskalla ja kusella saastuttamisen lisäksi), Pernambucon Julkinen Ministeriö (MPPE) ja Pernambucon ympäristöasioiden osavaltiosihteeristö (CPRH) eivät koskaan aloittaneet mitään rikostutkintaa suurtilallisyritys Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A:a vastaan.
 </p>
<p>
  Näin ollen talonpojat päättivät Kansankokouksessa toimeenpanna suuren aktion vesilähteiden ottamiseksi takaisin suurtilalta. Kutsu saavutti koko paikallisen väestön lentolehtisillä toreilla ja kaikissa tämän ympäristörikoksen ja kansan terveyden vastaisen rikoksen koskettamissa talonpoikaisyhteisöissä. Talonpojat järjestivät myös yhteisponnistuksia vesilähteiden puhdistamiseksi ja eristämiseksi, 50 metrin päässä suurtilanherran karjatiloista ja eucalyptusplantaaseista.

  Kaiken tämän työn suorittamiseksi tilanvaltaajat laskivat José Ricardon Vallankumouksellisen Alueen talonpoikien ja Mangue Vermelho -Liikkeen nuorten opiskelijoiden tukeen. He auttoivat raivaamaan puskat ja merkitsemään aidat vesilähteiden suojelemiseksi paahtavassa auringossa. Enemmänkin, he kohtasivat muun kansan rinnalla taistellen tilanherrojen provokaatiot.

  Heti kun talonpojat olivat suurella taisteluhengellä saaneet yhteisponnistuksensa päätökseen päivän ensimmäisellä vesilähteellä, laulaen kansanlauluja ja huutaen iskulauseita, puolitusinaa pyssymiestä suurtiloilta ilmestyi traktoreineen, lavafarmareineen, moottoripyörineen ja mönkijöineen. Pyssymiehet saapuivat tolppien, langan ja eukalyptussiementen kanssa laittamaan niitä samalle alueelle, jonka talonpojat olivat juuri raivanneet. Kun talonpoikaismarssi kohtasi bandiitit, tilanherrojen edustajat alkoivat uhkailla talonpoikia tuliaseilla. Jännite johti yhteenottoon, kolme pyssymiestä loukkaantui ja suurtilan drooni tuhottiin tuliaseista raivostuneiden kansanjoukkojen toimesta.
 </p>
<p>
  Tänä samana maaliskuuna 18:a MPPE:n maatalouspromoottori, CPRH:n agentit, edusajat Osavaltion Komiteasta Agraarikonfliktien Valvomiseksi (CEACA), edustajat Laidunmaiden Komissiosta (CPT) ja Pernambucon Työläisten ja Talonpoikien Federaatiosta (FETAPE), pormestari Ridete Pellegrino ja kunnanvaltuutetut Jaqueirasta, sekä lakimiehet suurtilallisyritys Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A:sta vierailivat tutkiakseen tilanherran tekemiä valituksia talonpojista. Tämän tiedon mukaan tämä komissio ei vieraillut talonpoikien vesilähteillä, vaan ainoastaan tilanherrojen osoittamissa paikoissa.
 </p>
<p>
  Kuitenkin, talonpoikien voimallinen aktio pakotti koko komission esittäytymään aktion tapahtumapaikalla ja hyväksymään kaksi lakimiestä Kansanasianajajien brasilialaisesta yhdistyksestä (Abrapo) sekä Barro Brancon Tilanvaltaajien Yhdistyksen puheenjohtajan komissioon ja tämän lisäksi joutui hyväksymään yleisössä olleen kansan kiireelliset ehdot.
 </p>
<p>
  Lopulta MPPE hyväksyi Abrapon edustamien talonpoikien ehdotuksen luoda “vesikäytävä” kansan vesilähteiden erottamiseksi. Tilanherra määrättiin maksamaan tolpat ja lanka, kaupunginhallinto lähettää työntekijät ja Osavaltion ympäristöosaston vastuulle tuli kansan vesien tutkiminen saastumisen määrittelyksi ja rikostutkinnan avaamiseksi tilanherraa vastaan.
 </p>
<p>
  Oikeuden kuulemisen jälkeen Guilherme Maranhãon pyssymiehet pyysivät vahvistuksia Pernambucon sotilaspoliisilta (PM-PE) eucalyptuksen istuttamiseksi yhdelle vesilähteistä, jonka talonpojat olivat siivonneet yhteistoimin, ja tilanherrojen lakimies Eduardo Figueredo julisti että he tulisivat suorittaamaan sotilaallisen aktion talonpoikaisperheiden karkottamiseksi metsiä lähellä sijaitsevilta alueilta.
 </p>
<p>
  Kaksi ajoneuvoa lähetettiin tuomaan turvaa pyssymiehille jatkaakseen kansanvastaisia toimiaan. Tämä ei ole rohkeutta osoittava teko, vaan pikemminkin pelkuruutta osoittava teko agraarivallankumouksen yhdistämien ja järjestämien talonpoikien pienen voimannäytön edessä. Se myös osoittaa, kuinka omistautuneita tämän vanhan valtion sotilasvoimat ovat tilanherrojen etujen suojelemiselle ja onnettumuuksien edistämiseksi köyhälle väestölle maalla ja kaupungissa.
 </p>
<p>
  Entisen Frei Canecan tilaa miehittävät talonpojat ovat päättäväisinä ottamaan takaisin kaikki vesilähteensä ja maansa tilanherran käsistä. Tällä tavoin he kutsuvat kaikkia talonpoikia Pernambucon eteläisellä metsäalueella nousemaan suurtilayritysten pyssymiesryhmiä ja tämän vanhan valtion asevoimia vastaan. Tuhoamatta suurtiloja ei voida koskaan saada oikeutta maaseudun köyhälle kansalle.

  No dia 19 de março, a comunidade camponesa São Benedito, no município de São Bernardo, no Maranhão, denunciou em sua rede social atividades criminosas de grileiros que ameaçam a vida da população local. No vídeo, uma criança de dez anos relata as tentativas de invasão e roubo de terra, mas que os camponeses “não vão deixar”. Ela também mostra a intensa produção camponesa no local.
 </p>
<p>
  A comunidade tem mais de 200 anos de existência, com terras passadas de geração para geração, na qual os moradores trabalham na roça para sua subsistência. De acordo com o que foi documentado pelos mesmos,
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/asso_sao_benedito_ma/?g=5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   por meio das redes sociais
  </a>
  , casas estão sendo demolidas, terras griladas estão sendo desmatadas sem a autorização do IBAMA e suas plantações também estão comprometidas por ações criminosas do latifúndio.

  Situações semelhantes têm crescido por todo estado do Maranhão, principalmente após a implementação da “Lei da Grilagem”, sancionada pelo governador Carlos Brandão. Sendo uma versão atualizada da conhecida Lei Sarney de Terras, a legislação que amplia a possibilidade de regularização de terras públicas de 200 para 2,5 mil hectares, servindo de instrumento para que latifundiários, em nome do agronegócio, sintam-se no direito de cometer hediondos atos de violência contra o povo camponês, indígenas e quilombolas.

   Come già abbiamo denunciato (*), il regime egiziano di Al Sisi sta facendo costruire un recinto nel deserto del Sinai per rinchiudervi i palestinesi in fuga da Gaza, e facilitare così la “pulizia etnica” da parte di Israele, in cambio di finanziamenti del Fmi.
  </p>
<p>
   Il regime egiziano è dominato dai militari, che sono anche tra i maggiori capitalisti del paese. Lanciatisi in affari “faraonici”, come la costruzione della nuova capitale (con enormi profitti per sé e per gli amici), hanno ingigantito anche il debito dello stato e ora il solo pagamento degli interessi sul debito pesa per oltre il 10% del Pil. Soluzione: stampare moneta, quindi creare inflazione, ossia tagliare il potere d’acquisto dei salari per mantenere i profitti dei padroni, privati, di stato e militari.
   <br>
   A settembre 2023 l’inflazione aveva raggiunto il 40%, ossia il potere d’acquisto dei già miseri salari e stipendi aveva subito un taglio del 40%.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Temendo il malcontento per i salari di fame anche tra i dipendenti pubblici, il governo ha decretato l’aumento del salario minimo da 4.000 a 6.000 sterline egiziane (al cambio corrente, oggi 120 euro al mese). Per i dipendenti privati, però, il salario minimo è stato portato a sole LE 3.500.
   <br>
   A gennaio, ai lavoratori che protestavano per i bassi salari, al Sisi aveva avuto la spudoratezza di rispondere: “Non mangiamo? Mangiamo. Non beviamo? Beviamo, e tutto funziona [e qui aveva fatto un osceno, irridente, paragone con la condizione dei palestinesi deliberatamente affamati e assetati dallo stato sionista – ndr.]. Le cose sono costose e alcune non sono disponibili? E allora?”.

</a>
<b>
   Mahalla al-Kubra nel Delta del Nilo, che ha più di un secolo di storia e di lotte, è arrivata il 22 febbraio.
  </b>
<b>
   Scandendo slogan di protesta sono scese in sciopero in 3.700.
  </b>
  Nonostante l’intervento delle guardie per impedire loro di accedere al piazzale centrale, e la scesa in campo del sindacato ufficiale contro lo sciopero, lo sciopero, sostenuto da un sindacato indipendente, si è esteso ad almeno 7 mila lavoratori.
  <br/>
  La risposta dei padroni e del governo è stata: bastone e carota. Salario minimo a 6.000 LE (un aumento del 70%), arresto di 13 “leader” dello sciopero (fonte: LabourStart), di cui due ancora detenuti alla data del 13 marzo, sono anche minacciati di licenziamento per assenza ingiustificata.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   Evidentemente padroni e governo contano sulla prosecuzione dell’inflazione (ancora al 31% a gennaio 2024), che rimangerà gli aumenti, e gli arresti sono un avvertimento a chiunque, a Mahalla o altrove, venisse in mente di tornare alla lotta.
   <br/>
   Ma lasciar proseguire lo sciopero senza concessioni è sembrato troppo pericoloso al governo: avrebbe rischiato un’esplosione generalizzata perché sa che il forte aumento del costo della vita ha aumentato la pressione tra i lavoratori.
   <br/>
   Un’esplosione che potrebbe collegarsi al sostegno popolare alla causa palestinese che in Egitto c’è, per quanto il regime militare faccia tutto quel che può per non farlo manifestare, e al più generale malcontento per le pesantissime condizioni di lavoro e di vita di milioni di proletari.
  </p>
<p>
   Negli stessi giorni, infatti, sono scesi in lotta anche centinaia di lavoratori di una grande impresa di costruzioni di proprietà del miliardario Talaat Moustafa, in società con la famiglia saudita dei Bin Laden.
  </p>
  Hanno protestato contro il licenziamento dei lavoratori a tempo indeterminato (soprattutto quelli che hanno subito incidenti sul lavoro o si sono ammalati) per assumere lavoratori con contratti precari, e chiedendo il pagamento di arretrati, un aumento salariale per il carovita, misure di sicurezza e dispositivi di protezione sui cantieri, una maggiore copertura sanitaria.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   In questo caso è significativo che le guardie aziendali, che una settimana prima erano intervenute a reprimere una protesta degli impiegati, qualche giorno dopo hanno a loro volta rifiutato di entrare in servizio, lamentando il fatto di essere pagati LE 3000 (60 euro) al mese per 14 ore di lavoro al giorno, e hanno ottenuto un aumento.
  </p>
<p>
   Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa, divenuto un colosso con le commesse per la nuova capitale, sta ora partecipando in società con il gruppo Adq degli Emirati a un progetto da 35 miliardi di dollari per la costruzione di una città turistica sul litorale mediterraneo, su terreni privatizzati dai militari.
  </p>
<p>
   Questi episodi di lotte operaie sono indicativi di una temperatura sociale che sta salendo in Egitto come in altri paesi del Medio Oriente e che potrebbe portare a nuove esplosioni se la crisi economica si aggraverà, in collegamento anche con la rabbia provocata dalla guerra genocidaria di Israele contro la popolazione di Gaza.
   <br/>
   Non a caso il Fmi offre ad al-Sisi miliardi in cambio del lavoro sporco di collaborazione con Israele; mentre da parte loro Meloni e von del Leyen promettono 7,4 miliardi di euro all’Egitto perché faccia il lavoro altrettanto sporco di trattenere gli emigranti verso l’Europa, oltre che per altri lucrosi affari.
  </p>
<p>
   Ci permettiamo di ripeterlo: gli unici veri amici dei palestinesi aggrediti e oppressi da Israele a Gaza e in Cisgiordania sono i lavoratori e gli sfruttati della regione e del mondo, non i governi capitalisti arabi che sfruttano e reprimono i propri lavoratori e sono pronti a fare affari collaborando con le metropoli imperialiste nella repressione di palestinesi e migranti.

    MIGLIAIA DI LAVORATORI SCIOPERANO PER L’AUMENTO DEI SALARI NELLA FABBRICA DI GHAZL AL-MAHALLA
   </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
   – di Beesan Kassab, 25 febbraio 2024
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori di Ghazl al-Mahalla sono in sciopero per ottenere salari più alti e bonus più equi.
  </p>
<p>
   Circa 7.000 lavoratori si sono riuniti sabato mattina nella piazza centrale del complesso industriale di Ghazl al-Mahalla per uno sciopero che dura già da tre giorni.
  </p>
<p>
   Chiedono che il loro pasto giornaliero venga aumentato a 30 LE [=0,57 euro], alzando un coro in cui si dice che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
  </p>
<p>
   Chiedono anche l’applicazione di salari più alti, facendo riferimento a un recente aumento salariale per il settore pubblico basato su istruzioni del presidente Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in mezzo a un’ondata inflazionistica che ha fatto salire il costo della vita a livello nazionale. In altri slogan, i lavoratori hanno chiesto: “Dov’è la decisione di Sisi?”.
  </p>
<p>
   La mega-fabbrica di proprietà pubblica impiega decine di migliaia di persone nei settori della filatura, del tessile e del cotone medicale, oltre a una centrale elettrica su un’enorme area di terreno a Mahalla al-Kubra, nel governatorato di Gharbiya.
  </p>
<p>
   Fino a domenica, le trattative dei lavoratori con la società madre sono fallite, ha dichiarato il Centro per i sindacati e i servizi ai lavoratori in un comunicato diffuso sabato sera. All’incontro hanno partecipato un rappresentante della presidenza, dell’Ufficio del Lavoro, del Ministero del Commercio e dell’Industria e il presidente del Sindacato Generale della Filatura e Tessitura.
  </p>
<p>
   Diversi uomini che lavorano nell’azienda sono stati trattenuti sabato dall’Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza dopo essere stati convocati per essere interrogati dall’organismo di sicurezza insieme ad alcune lavoratrici, ha dichiarato la CTUWS, senza specificare il numero dei detenuti.
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori hanno lanciato lo sciopero giovedì [22 febbraio], hanno dichiarato a Mada Masr, iniziando nelle fabbriche di abbigliamento a prevalenza femminile, che storicamente sono state in prima linea in diversi scioperi famosi dell’azienda.
  </p>
<p>
   Hanan*, supervisore di una fabbrica di abbigliamento, ha raccontato a Mada Masr che gli operai del suo edificio hanno iniziato a scandire slogan, interrompendo infine il lavoro mentre i canti si diffondevano da una fabbrica all’altra.
  </p>
<p>
   Contemporaneamente, il personale di sicurezza ha sigillato le uscite per evitare che le donne si riversassero nella piazza centrale del complesso, nota come piazza Talaat Harb. Questa misura di sicurezza è stata applicata anche alla centrale elettrica, secondo Abdullah* che lavora lì.
  </p>
<p>
   Il personale di sicurezza ha sbloccato i cancelli della fabbrica intorno alle 15.00 di giovedì, mezz’ora prima della fine del turno mattutino, per assicurarsi che i lavoratori uscissero dai locali e non si riunissero all’interno, ha detto Hanan.
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori dell’azienda hanno descritto i bassi salari come causa di insoddisfazione.
  </p>
<p>
   Il costo della vita è aumentato in tutto il Paese, con un’inflazione che supererà il 30% nel 2024. Un recente “pacchetto presidenziale”, che sarà varato a partire da marzo, prevede un aumento del salario minimo per il settore pubblico da 4.000 a 6.000 LE al mese, con incrementi che vanno da 1.000 a 1.200 LE per le diverse categorie lavorative.
  </p>
<p>
   Sebbene sia di proprietà dello Stato, la Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, che possiede Ghazl al-Mahalla, non rientra nell’ambito del pacchetto presidenziale, ha dichiarato a Mada Masr una fonte del Ministero delle Finanze.
  </p>
<p>
   I salari dell’azienda sono invece guidati dalle decisioni del Consiglio nazionale per i salari, che lo scorso ottobre ha innalzato il salario minimo del settore privato a 3.500 LE.
  </p>
<p>
   Ma l’aumento di ottobre non è servito a contrastare la riduzione del potere d’acquisto causata dall’inflazione. Dopo più di 25 anni di servizio, Abdel Aziz* ha dichiarato a Mada Masr che il suo guadagno totale non supera i 4.000 LE al mese. La cifra equivale a circa 130 dollari al tasso di cambio ufficiale, o a circa 80 dollari al tasso del mercato parallelo al momento in cui scriviamo.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdullah ha dichiarato che il suo stipendio è di 4.200 LEE dopo 33 anni di lavoro con l’azienda. Hanan, che si sta avvicinando alla pensione, riceve uno stipendio di circa 6.200 LE.
  </p>
<p>
   Diverse fonti di lavoro dell’azienda hanno raccontato che giorni prima dello sciopero, il governatore di Gharbiya aveva effettuato una serie di visite per ispezionare un convoglio che fornisce beni sovvenzionati ai lavoratori dell’azienda.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdel Aziz ha aggiunto che durante la visita di mercoledì, il governatore ha ispezionato un convoglio medico che rifornisce i lavoratori e “un lavoratore ha detto al governatore che il suo stipendio non supera i 3500 LE”.
  </p>
<p>
   Secondo una dichiarazione della CTUWS pubblicata sabato, i lavoratori chiedono ora che il salario minimo sia portato a 6.000 LE, con aumenti salariali in base all’anzianità di servizio e una riduzione degli stanziamenti fiscali.
  </p>
<p>
   Chiedono inoltre che la loro indennità giornaliera per i pasti sia aumentata a 30 LE, per un totale di 900 LE al mese invece degli attuali 210 LE al mese, con un canto che circolava durante lo sciopero in cui si affermava che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
  </p>
<p>
   La dichiarazione del CTUWS di sabato [24 febbraio] ha sottolineato che i membri del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda, affiliato alla Federazione sindacale egiziana allineata allo Stato, hanno cercato di dissuadere i lavoratori dallo sciopero e di intimidirli, ma sono stati espulsi dalla piazza.
  </p>
<p>
   Una figura di spicco del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda ha dichiarato giovedì a Mada Masr, a condizione di anonimato, che il comitato “preferisce la negoziazione allo sciopero, ma sostiene le richieste dei lavoratori”.
  </p>
<p>
   Ghazl al-Mahalla ha agito da catalizzatore alla fine del 2006 per una rinascita dell’azione sindacale a livello nazionale, quando uno sciopero di decine di migliaia di lavoratori della fabbrica si è riverberato in un movimento di scioperi simili in altre fabbriche del Paese.

  </p>
<p>
   In uno sviluppo preoccupante, la Sicurezza Nazionale di Gharbia, in Egitto, avrebbe trattenuto almeno cinque dipendenti della rinomata azienda tessile Ghazl El-Mahalla, nonostante la decisione dei lavoratori di disperdere il loro sciopero del 29 febbraio 2024.
   <br/>
   I dipendenti hanno iniziato lo sciopero per chiedere l’applicazione del salario minimo.
  </p>
<p>
   Tra i detenuti ci sono Wael Abu Zuwayed e Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, attualmente trattenuti presso la sede della Sicurezza Nazionale a Tanta. Essi si aggiungono ad altri tre lavoratori, Sabah Ali al-Qattan, Muhammad al-Attar e Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, anch’essi detenuti.
  </p>
<p>
   Wael Abu Zuwayed è stato portato davanti alla Procura della Sicurezza di Stato del Cairo, dove è stato deciso di trattenerlo in custodia cautelare per 15 giorni. È accusato di aver aderito a un gruppo formato in violazione della legge e di aver diffuso false informazioni.
  </p>
<p>
   Con una mossa controversa, il 4 marzo la direzione di Ghazl El Mahalla ha emesso avvisi di licenziamento per i lavoratori detenuti, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed e Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. L’azienda sostiene che la loro assenza dal lavoro è durata dieci giorni, ignorando opportunamente che è avvenuta in seguito alla loro detenzione da parte della Sicurezza Nazionale.
  </p>
<p>
   Il Comitato per la giustizia (CFJ) ha condannato le detenzioni, affermando che lo sciopero è una reazione “spontanea” alle difficoltà economiche dell’Egitto e alla confusione della politica finanziaria. Il CFJ sottolinea la necessità di un dialogo costruttivo e di soluzioni realistiche per affrontare le legittime richieste dei lavoratori, invece di ricorrere alla repressione e all’intimidazione. […]

<p>
   Oltre a subire le pressioni delle masse per la vile risposta del regime egiziano agli spietati attacchi dello Stato israeliano a Gaza, il presidente “uomo forte” Sisi deve affrontare la crescente rabbia dei lavoratori. L’aumento vertiginoso dei prezzi dei generi alimentari ha colpito duramente i lavoratori egiziani a basso salario, ma ci sono segnali di una ripresa della lotta.
  </p>
<p>
   Circa 14.000 lavoratori tessili della più grande fabbrica egiziana, la Misr Spin-ning and Weaving Company, a Mahalla al-Kubra, nella regione del Delta del Nilo, hanno iniziato una settimana di sciopero il 22 febbraio. I lavoratori di una delle maggiori filiali della società immobiliare Talaat Moustafa Group, la Alexan-dria Construction, al Cairo, hanno protestato il 28 febbraio.
  </p>
<p>
   Sono state le lavoratrici della fabbrica di abbigliamento Mahalla a iniziare a scandire slogan che si sono rapidamente diffusi da un edificio all’altro. Il personale di sicurezza ha bloccato le uscite per impedire che questi lavoratori, così come quelli della centrale elettrica in loco, si riunissero nella piazza centrale. Tuttavia, il terzo giorno, 7.000 scioperanti si sono radunati lì. Decine di persone sono state arrestate. Come di consueto, il comitato sindacale ufficiale gestito dallo Stato ha denunciato lo sciopero, ma i lavoratori li hanno cacciati dalla manifestazione.
  </p>
<p>
   Questo evento riecheggia lo storico sciopero del 2006, quando le donne di Mahalla iniziarono lo sciopero che fu un passo fondamentale verso la rivolta del 2011 che mise fine ai 31 anni di governo del presidente Hosni Mubarak. Nel 2008, la città ha assistito a una rivolta che si sarebbe ripetuta su scala nazionale tre anni dopo.
  </p>
<p>
   […] Lo sciopero è terminato dopo una settimana, in seguito all’intervento del Ministro del settore pubblico. La direzione ha accettato di pagare un minimo di 6.000 LE al mese e la maggior parte dei lavoratori arrestati è stata rilasciata. Un’offerta precedente, che includeva il pagamento degli straordinari, la partecipazione agli utili e l’assicurazione sanitaria, non è stata accettata.
  </p>
<p>
   Protesta dei lavoratori edili
  </p>
<p>
   Centinaia di lavoratori della Talaat Moustafa hanno protestato davanti alla sede dell’azienda. L’azienda ha licenziato lavoratori con contratti a tempo indeterminato e li ha sostituiti con lavoratori temporanei a condizioni peggiori. I lavoratori hanno chiesto pagamenti arretrati, un bonus per il costo della vita, una migliore assicurazione sanitaria e dispositivi di sicurezza nei cantieri.
  </p>
<p>
   Le condizioni dei cantieri sono pessime, non sono disponibili dispositivi di sicurezza e la copertura sanitaria è insufficiente. Molti lavoratori licenziati sono stati feriti sul lavoro o soffrono di malattie croniche.
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori hanno riferito ai giornalisti che i criteri per i bonus e gli aumenti sono oscuri, ma vengono costantemente erogati a persone imparentate o collegate ai dirigenti. I dirigenti e i loro assistenti ricevono benefici sontuosi, mentre le retribuzioni dei lavoratori rimangono basse.
  </p>
<p>
   Insolitamente, la polizia non ha tentato di bloccare la protesta, anche se in passato ha fermato proteste più piccole. Tuttavia, il 4 marzo una protesta dei lavoratori degli uffici è stata impedita quando le forze di sicurezza hanno bloccato i cancelli.
  </p>
<p>
   Ma poi centinaia di guardie di sicurezza dell’azienda si sono rifiutate di iniziare il loro turno! Hanno chiesto salari più alti, migliori benefit, orari di lavoro e ferie. “I nostri stipendi sono molto bassi, pari a 3.000 LE. Lavoriamo per oltre 14 ore al giorno, a differenza del resto dei dipendenti. Riceviamo il bonus trimestrale a una percentuale inferiore rispetto a loro”, ha spiegato una guardia.
  </p>
<p>
   Nel giro di 30 minuti, un alto dirigente li ha incontrati, promettendo di pagare un aumento entro due mesi, dopodiché la protesta è terminata.
  </p>
<p>
   Il regime di Mubarak rimane
  </p>
<p>
   Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa ha avuto enormi contratti per la costruzione della nuova capitale che il presidente Sisi ha supervisionato. Nell’ultimo anno ha triplicato le sue attività nel settore immobiliare e dell’ospitalità, nonostante la crisi economica dell’Egitto. Negli ultimi mesi il prezzo delle sue azioni è salito, facendo guadagnare milioni di dollari al suo multimilionario azionista principale, Talaat Moustafa. Uno degli uomini più ricchi dell’Africa, era vicino al figlio di Hosni Mubarak, Gamal, odiato dai lavoratori per aver spinto una vasta privatizzazione quando il padre era presidente.
  </p>
<p>
   Nel 2008, Talaat Moustafa è stato riconosciuto colpevole di aver pagato 2 milioni di dollari a un ex poliziotto per uccidere la cantante libanese Suzanne Tamim. Gli altri principali azionisti del Gruppo Talaat Moustafa sono la famiglia Bin Laden dell’Arabia Saudita.
  </p>
<p>
   A febbraio, la società ha concluso un accordo di partnership con la società di investimenti degli Emirati Arabi Uniti ADQ per la costruzione di una nuova e vasta città turistica a Ras el-Hikma, sulla costa mediterranea, a ovest di Alessandria. L’operazione da 35 miliardi di dollari, compresa la vendita di terreni da parte dell’esercito, aiuterà notevolmente il governo di Sisi a pagare i 42 miliardi di dollari di debiti e gli interessi che dovrà pagare quest’anno. Molti sono gli interrogativi sollevati, tra cui la fattibilità del progetto, il suo costo ambientale, il vero valore del terreno, come si sia arrivati alla proprietà dell’esercito, quale sia l’opinione dei residenti locali (che non sono stati consultati) e quali controlli ci saranno sui futuri profitti in una “zona economica libera”.
  </p>
<p>
   Il disperato bisogno di valuta estera del governo Sisi lo ha costretto a vendere beni di proprietà dello Stato. Ras el-Hikma si aggiunge alla lista crescente di aziende e terreni egiziani ora sotto la proprietà e il controllo del Golfo.
  </p>
<p>
   Le gravi disuguaglianze, la corruzione e la brutale repressione dell’opposizione del regime dell’ex presidente Hosni Mubarak sono continuate, e persino aumentate, sotto Sisi. I recenti scioperi e le proteste dei lavoratori potrebbero segnare l’inizio di una nuova ondata di azioni della classe operaia, come quella sviluppatasi negli ultimi anni di Mubarak.
  </p>
<p>
   Il risveglio della classe operaia egiziana potrebbe essere un potente fattore per porre fine alla crisi di Gaza, aprire il valico di Rafah agli aiuti umanitari e incoraggiare i lavoratori e i poveri di tutto il Medio Oriente e del Nord Africa a spodestare i loro governanti mega-ricchi in tutta la regione.
  </p>
<p>
   Per porre fine alla povertà capitalista, alla guerra e alla distruzione dell’ambiente è necessario costruire sindacati indipendenti e partiti dei lavoratori con programmi socialisti, democratici e internazionalisti.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Zur Zeit laufen mindestens fünf Sammelklagen in verschiedenen Provinzen Kanadas gegen sowohl Mediziner als auch die kanadische Regierung aufgrund der Zwangssterilisation indigener Frauen.
  <a href="/index.php/de/t-proletarischer-feminismus/7939-zwangssterilisationen-in-den-usa">
   Ähnlich wie in den USA
  </a>
  wuchs auch in Kanada Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts die „Eugeniker“-Bewegung an, die offen erklärte, die indigene Bevölkerung mittels Unfruchtbarkeitsmachung zu „kontrollieren“.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Die Provinzen Alberta und British Columbia betrieben im 20. Jahrhundert von der Eugeniker-Bewegung initiierte Sterilisationsprogramme,
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   die zusammen mit dem „Indian Act“ – ein rassistisches und bis heute geltendes Gesetz, dass den Indigenen, den „First Nations“, deutlich weniger Rechte einräumt als den „Weißen“ und für sie Reservate vorsieht –

  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Von den 1960ern bis in die 1980er fiel die Geburtenrate der Indigenen in Kanada von 47 auf 28 Prozent.
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   In den 70ern begann die Abschaffung der Eugenik-Gesetze, doch die zunehmenden Klagen und Untersuchungen der vergangenen Jahre haben gezeigt,
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   dass für den kanadischen Imperialismus Zwangssterilisationen weiter ein gängiges Mittel sind, ethnische Säuberungen gegenüber den knapp fünf Prozent der Gesamtbevölkerung Kanadas ausmachenden Indigenen
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   vorzunehmen.

  Yvonne Boyer hat es seit den 1970ern in Kanada mindestens 12.000 Fälle von Zwangssterilisationen – oft waren die Frauen über lange Zeit danach darüber unwissend – gegeben:
  <em>
   „Im Norden waren wir beispielsweise noch nicht. Wir wissen: 26 Prozent der Frauen in Igloolik wurden sterilisiert. Sie brachten sie mit Schiffen in den Süden, machten Massensterilisationen und brachten sie zurück.“
  </em>

   L'assalto genocida israeliano a Gaza ha messo in luce l'approccio crudo e
 calcolato delle sue operazioni militari, che prendono di mira in 
particolare le infrastrutture civili. Le intuizioni di ex funzionari 
dell'intelligence israeliana, riportate dalle pubblicazioni liberali 
israeliane +972 Magazine e Local Call, hanno evidenziato l'intento 
strategico di terrorizzare i civili attraverso il bombardamento mirato 
di strutture civili essenziali. Una strategia che, come ha detto un ex 
ufficiale dell'intelligence, si è trasformata in una "fabbrica di 
omicidi di massa", concentrandosi su aree residenziali, scuole, banche 
ed edifici governativi, tutti considerati "obiettivi di potere". I 
rapporti fanno luce sull'impiego sofisticato dell'Intelligenza 
Artificiale (AI) nella guerra, in particolare attraverso il Progetto 
Habsora "Il Vangelo" [1]. Questa tecnologia, analizzando i dati di 
sorveglianza, automatizza la generazione di liste di obiettivi, 
contribuendo all'elevato numero di vittime civili a Gaza. Questa tattica
 rappresenta una pietra miliare nell'applicazione dell'AI nelle 
operazioni militari, con Gaza che diventa un sito senza precedenti per 
tali campagne guidate dall'AI, soprattutto dopo il primo attacco guidato
 dall'AI nel 2021.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Questo genocidio fa luce sull'intreccio tra il militarismo nazionalista 
israeliano, la complicità degli Stati Uniti, la sperimentazione di armi 
letali e gli obiettivi geopolitici, che convergono tutti verso gli 
obiettivi di una guerra prolungata, dell'espansione coloniale e dello 
sradicamento sistematico dei Palestinesi. In particolare, rivela la 
misura in cui l'esistenza e la funzione stessa di Israele, come 
formazione coloniale
   <span>
<a name="more">

</span>
   di insediamento, è organicamente legata a un 
complesso militare-industriale espansivo che ha plasmato 
fondamentalmente la sua società e cultura, l'economia, le relazioni di 
politica estera e il sostegno esterno.
   <br/>
<br/>
   La fondazione di Israele nel 1948 ha posto le basi per lo sviluppo di un
 vasto complesso militare-industriale, intricato nelle sue strutture 
economiche, sociali e politiche, che si estende oltre il tradizionale 
ambito delle operazioni di difesa. Questo complesso sistema incorpora 
un'ampia gamma di capacità, tra cui la produzione di armi avanzate, lo 
sviluppo di tecnologie a doppio uso, le innovazioni nel campo della 
sicurezza privata, gli investimenti strategici di capitale e le 
elaborate strategie di esportazione-importazione. Inoltre, offre vaste 
opportunità di lavoro nei settori pubblico e privato.
   <span>
</span>
<br/>
   Una serie di attori diversi guida questa matrice militarizzata, 
ampliando il suo impatto al di là dei confini dei domini militari e di 
sicurezza, per includere vari attori finanziari. Questi includono 
investitori, appaltatori e aziende tecnologiche, capitali ebraici, 
soprattutto quelli provenienti dal settore militare e dalle finanze 
americane. L'influenza delle iniziative militari-economiche di Israele 
permea anche settori non militari, instaurando collaborazioni con 
istituzioni accademiche, organizzazioni sanitarie, sindacati e comunità 
di ricerca scientifica.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Questa fusione di obiettivi militari con la vita civile ha favorito una 
perfetta integrazione degli interessi militari ed economici nella 
società israeliana. Il risultato è una rete vasta e interconnessa in cui
 i programmi delle entità militari-economiche sono profondamente 
radicati nell'ethos sionista, influenzando un ampio spettro di processi 
sociali e politici.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Questo documento mira a evidenziare quattro pilastri fondamentali che 
alimentano l'espansione del complesso militare-industriale di Israele.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Militarismo iper-nazionalistico
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   L'ethos fondativo di Israele è profondamente intrecciato con il 
militarismo e il nazionalismo, creando un distintivo patto militarizzato
 tra lo Stato e i suoi cittadini. Questo legame è notevolmente più 
pronunciato rispetto ad altre nazioni emerse dopo la Seconda guerra 
mondiale, con l'esercito israeliano che occupa un ruolo centrale non 
solo nei settori della sicurezza, ma che estende la sua influenza alle 
sfere economiche, sociali e culturali. Questa sfumatura dei confini tra 
settore militare e civile sfida le aspettative teoriche convenzionali 
civili-militari di separazione distinta di ruoli e identità.
   <br/>
<br/>
   In Israele, l'esercito non è solo un'entità di difesa, ma agisce come 
istituzione cardine per l'integrazione e l'impegno sociale, influenzando
 un'ampia gamma di aspetti della società, tra cui l'istruzione, i 
processi giudiziari, i media, le iniziative economiche e l'assimilazione
 degli immigrati ebrei. Come descritto da Baruch Kimmerling, l'esercito è
 il "principio organizzativo centrale" che lega il tessuto sociale, 
plasmando le identità e i valori collettivi [2]. Questo militarismo 
pervasivo non è solo una fase transitoria, ma una convinzione 
profondamente radicata nella maggioranza degli ebrei israeliani, che 
indica il militarismo come un'ideologia fondamentale [3]. Non sorprende 
che Israele sia la nazione più militarizzata del mondo [4].
   <br/>
<br/>
   In Israele, l'intreccio del militarismo con l'istruzione e il mondo 
accademico è profondo, con le istituzioni educative che promuovono norme
 militariste fin dalla più tenera età. Ciò è evidente nel modo in cui le
 università sono attivamente impegnate nello sviluppo di tecnologie 
militari e nel coltivare talenti destinati al settore della difesa. 
Programmi d'élite come Talpiot e Havatzalot esemplificano questo 
aspetto, dotando gli studenti delle competenze necessarie per ricoprire 
ruoli nelle imprese tecnologiche militari e orientate alla sicurezza, 
sostenendo così l'economia di guerra della nazione.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Il settore high-tech israeliano, fortemente influenzato dagli incubatori
 di innovazione militare, è una pietra miliare dell'economia nazionale, 
contribuendo al 18,1% del PIL e impiegando circa il 14% della forza 
lavoro [5]. La crescita di questo settore è significativamente spinta 
dalle sinergie con l'esercito, attraverso contratti governativi, 
iniziative di cooperazione e investimenti attratti dalle capacità di 
doppio uso delle tecnologie. Tali collaborazioni hanno favorito un 
ecosistema high-tech dinamico, ricco di startup in crescita e di aziende
 militari e di sicurezza.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Patrocinio militare degli Stati Uniti
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   La relazione tra gli Stati Uniti e Israele è fondamentalmente 
caratterizzata da un quadro di patrono-cliente, in cui Israele si 
allinea agli obiettivi strategici degli Stati Uniti in Medio Oriente in 
cambio di un sostanziale sostegno economico, militare e diplomatico, 
stabilendo un controllo sub-imperiale reciproco.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Al centro di questa alleanza c'è l'assistenza finanziaria degli Stati 
Uniti, che è fondamentale per lo sviluppo delle capacità militari di 
Israele. Tra il 1949 e il 2022, Israele ha beneficiato di oltre 158 
miliardi di dollari di aiuti militari da parte degli Stati Uniti. Questo
 sostegno finanziario gioca un ruolo cruciale nelle allocazioni di 
bilancio di Israele, rappresentando il 3% del suo bilancio statale 
totale, circa l'1% del suo PIL, il 20% della sua spesa per la difesa, il
 40% del bilancio del suo esercito e la maggior parte delle sue spese di
 approvvigionamento. In particolare, questi aiuti tendono ad aumentare 
durante i periodi di conflitto, come durante la seconda Intifada e il 
conflitto del 2023 a Gaza, evidenziando la sua reattività alle sfide di 
sicurezza di Israele. Gli aiuti vengono erogati principalmente 
attraverso il programma Foreign Military Financing (FMF) e i progetti di
 collaborazione finanziati dal Dipartimento della Difesa degli Stati 
Uniti. Una caratteristica distintiva degli aiuti statunitensi a Israele è
 la possibilità di utilizzare il 25-30% di questi fondi per l'acquisto 
di armamenti locali, a differenza della consueta clausola che obbliga i 
beneficiari ad acquistare esclusivamente prodotti militari di 
fabbricazione americana.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Un rapporto del Congresso sottolinea l'impatto trasformativo di questa 
assistenza sulle forze armate israeliane, senza le quali l'arsenale 
militare avanzato di Israele sarebbe irraggiungibile [6]. Alla base di 
questo sostegno c'è l'impegno degli Stati Uniti a preservare il 
vantaggio militare qualitativo (Qualitative Military Edge, QME) di 
Israele rispetto agli avversari regionali, garantendo la sua continua 
preminenza militare.
   <br/>
<br/>
   La partnership strategica tra Stati Uniti e Israele è stata avviata al 
momento della fondazione di Israele nel 1948, ma sono stati i 
cambiamenti geopolitici successivi alla guerra del 1967 a intensificare 
significativamente la loro alleanza. Riconoscendo Israele come un 
baluardo critico contro l'ascesa del panarabismo e l'influenza 
sovietica, l'amministrazione Nixon incrementò il sostegno degli Stati 
Uniti, come dimostra il drammatico aumento degli aiuti militari da 360 
milioni di dollari nel 1968 a circa 2,2 miliardi di dollari nel 1973, 
segnando un aumento dell'800% alle soglie della guerra arabo-israeliana.
   <br/>
<br/>
   La relazione si è ulteriormente consolidata sotto l'amministrazione 
Reagan, che ha designato Israele come "importante alleato non-NATO", una
 mossa che ha rafforzato la cooperazione militare e tecnologica tra le 
due nazioni. Quest'epoca è stata caratterizzata da notevoli investimenti
 degli Stati Uniti nelle capacità di difesa di Israele attraverso sforzi
 di ricerca e sviluppo collaborativi, che hanno portato all'integrazione
 e alla dipendenza di Israele dalla tecnologia militare statunitense. 
Questa dipendenza è evidenziata da progetti di difesa significativi come
 il sistema missilistico Arrow, il jet Lavi, il carro armato Merkava e 
il sistema Iron Dome, che includono componenti americani o sono stati 
sviluppati congiuntamente con un sostanziale contributo finanziario 
americano.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Nel 2016, l'Amministrazione Obama ha elevato l'assistenza militare degli
 Stati Uniti a un nuovo livello, grazie a un accordo che ha aumentato il
 pacchetto di aiuti annuali verso Israele da 3,1 miliardi di dollari a 
3,8 miliardi di dollari per gli anni 2019-2028, per un totale di 38 
miliardi di dollari, che rappresenta l'impegno di aiuti militari 
bilaterali più consistente nella storia degli Stati Uniti. Questo 
accordo rappresenta più del 20% del bilancio della difesa di Israele.
   <br/>
<br/>
   La profonda dipendenza dalla tecnologia militare americana ha plasmato 
in modo significativo il vantaggio competitivo delle aziende di difesa 
israeliane, posizionandole principalmente come subappaltatori nella 
produzione di componenti specializzati per i sistemi statunitensi. 
Questi includono i progressi nel GPS e nella navigazione, le simulazioni
 di addestramento, le tecnologie ottiche e le misure di cybersecurity. 
Questa dinamica sottolinea una relazione in cui gli appaltatori della 
difesa statunitensi stabiliscono in gran parte i termini dell'impegno, 
illustrando il ruolo di Israele come partecipante subordinato 
all'interno dell'ampio complesso militare-industriale statunitense.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    La Palestina come laboratorio
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   Israele si è affermato come un importante sviluppatore e distributore di
 tecnologie militari avanzate, sfruttando le sue esperienze operative a 
Gaza, in Cisgiordania, in Libano e in Siria per commercializzare i suoi 
prodotti come "testati in battaglia". Questa denominazione implica per 
queste tecnologie il fatto di essersi dimostrate efficaci attraverso 
l'uso effettivo in combattimento. Tuttavia, la realtà sottostante è che 
tale efficacia è spesso dimostrata attraverso l'impiego di queste 
tecnologie in azioni altamente brutali contro popolazioni in gran parte 
civili [7].
   <br/>
<br/>
   Gli aeromobili a pilotaggio remoto (Unmanned aerial vehicles, UAV), o 
droni, sono un elemento cardine dell'economia di guerra israeliana; il 
Paese è una forza dominante nella tecnologia dei droni, con oltre il 60%
 delle esportazioni mondiali nel 2017 [8].
   <br/>
<br/>
   L'avanzamento e il perfezionamento della tecnologia dei droni israeliani
 sono significativamente influenzati dal loro impiego operativo nei 
territori palestinesi. I droni sono diventati un punto fermo nelle 
operazioni militari di Israele, offrendo una sorveglianza persistente su
 Gaza. L'uso dei droni nelle guerre contro Gaza è brutale e aggressivo, 
portando a una serie di assalti mirati, attacchi missilistici e 
uccisioni di massa extragiudiziali. Tali operazioni hanno provocato la 
perdita di vite civili e la distruzione diffusa di infrastrutture 
civili.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Gaza ha un duplice scopo nel quadro del complesso militare-industriale 
israeliano, trasformando gli atti di aggressione coloniale in 
opportunità di test operativi e di vetrina commerciale. Da un lato, Gaza
 è emersa come un laboratorio a cielo aperto per la guerra con i droni, 
ponendo le basi per la sperimentazione biopolitica di nuove tecnologie 
letali. Questa situazione getta un'ombra oscura sulla mercificazione di 
tali tecnologie, radicata in pratiche che non hanno nulla a che fare con
 la "necessità militare", ma piuttosto con una vera e propria crudeltà. 
D'altra parte, Gaza fornisce uno scenario reale alle aziende di difesa 
israeliane per mostrare i loro progressi tecnologici, trasformando di 
fatto la Striscia assediata in piattaforme di marketing per l'hardware 
militare [9].
   <br/>
<br/>
   In ogni offensiva militare israeliana contro Gaza dal 2008 al 2023, i 
droni sono stati centrali nella strategia. Modelli come Hermes di Elbit 
Systems e Heron Eitan di Israeli Aerospace Industries, dotati di 
caratteristiche avanzate come i missili Spike autoguidati, sono stati 
fondamentali per queste aggressioni. Ogni offensiva di Gaza ha agito 
come un banco di prova e una piattaforma di sviluppo per questi droni, 
portando al loro perfezionamento e alla vendita commerciale.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Il commercio di armi come strumento di normalizzazione
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   Negli ultimi anni, Israele si è posizionato come un attore significativo
 nel mercato globale delle armi, con il 70%-80% della sua produzione 
militare diretta a clienti internazionali. Questo aspetto del commercio è
 fondamentale per Israele, in quanto le esportazioni di armi 
costituiscono circa il 25% delle sue entrate totali di esportazione 
industriale, dimostrando l'importanza vitale delle vendite militari 
nelle sue strategie economiche e commerciali. Nel periodo dal 2014 al 
2018, Israele si è classificato come l'ottavo fornitore di armi a 
livello globale, contribuendo al 3,1% del commercio mondiale di armi 
[10].

<br/>
   Le vendite di armi israeliane hanno registrato una forte crescita, 
soprattutto in seguito agli Accordi di Abramo del 2020, che hanno aperto
 opportunità nei nuovi mercati degli Stati arabi. In questo periodo, le 
esportazioni militari israeliane hanno raggiunto livelli senza 
precedenti, con un fatturato di 11,3 miliardi di dollari nel 2021 e 
un'ulteriore ascesa a 12,5 miliardi di dollari nel 2022, di cui una 
parte significativa è stata attribuita alle vendite nei Paesi arabi 
[11].
   <br/>
<br/>
   Tuttavia, l'importanza delle esportazioni di armi di Israele va oltre il
 mero guadagno finanziario; esse svolgono un ruolo cruciale nel suo 
posizionamento strategico internazionale e nella sua politica estera. 
Definita "diplomazia delle armi", Israele sfrutta la vendita di armi per
 raggiungere due obiettivi principali: incoraggiare la normalizzazione 
delle relazioni e rafforzare le alleanze.
   <br/>
<br/>
   In primo luogo, le esportazioni di armi servono a Israele come via 
strategica per espandere la sua impronta diplomatica globale, in 
particolare con le nazioni che storicamente si sono astenute dallo 
stabilire relazioni diplomatiche formali. Un esempio recente di questo 
impiego strategico delle esportazioni militari è l'approfondimento dei 
legami tra Israele e alcuni Stati arabi del Golfo, una relazione che è 
passata da interazioni segrete ad alleanze formali con gli Accordi di 
Abramo. Questi accordi hanno facilitato un livello di cooperazione 
militare e di sicurezza senza precedenti, con Israele che ha trasferito 
tecnologie militari e di sicurezza per un valore di circa 3 miliardi di 
dollari agli Emirati Arabi Uniti e al Bahrein [12]. Questo sviluppo 
segna un riallineamento significativo nel panorama geopolitico 
mediorientale, con Israele che sfrutta le sue capacità di difesa per 
creare connessioni diplomatiche ed estendere la sua influenza nella 
regione.
   <br/>
<br/>
   In secondo luogo, Israele utilizza strategicamente le esportazioni di 
armi per sostenere i regimi che sono alleati o che condividono interessi
 strategici comuni, soprattutto quelli che affrontano disordini interni o
 aggressioni esterne. Questo approccio ha dei precedenti storici; 
durante gli anni '70 e '80, Israele è stato un fornitore chiave di 
hardware militare ai governi militari dell'America Latina e Centrale, 
fornendo un sostegno sostanziale ai regimi spesso impegnati in pratiche 
repressive [13]. Al di là delle Americhe, la collaborazione militare di 
Israele si è estesa a regimi controversi come il Sudafrica 
dell'apartheid, con offerte che includevano la vendita di capacità di 
armi nucleari. Queste azioni sottolineano l'uso che Israele fa delle 
esportazioni militari non solo come transazioni economiche, ma come 
strumenti di strategia geopolitica, sostenendo regimi che si allineano 
con i suoi interessi di sicurezza più ampi, anche nei casi in cui tale 
sostegno ha contribuito alla perpetuazione di violazioni dei diritti 
umani. Attraverso queste esportazioni, Israele non solo solidifica le 
sue alleanze esistenti, ma cerca anche di influenzare le dinamiche della
 sicurezza regionale e globale a suo favore. Nell'era successiva alla 
Guerra fredda, Israele ha trovato le sue esportazioni di prodotti per la
 difesa coinvolte in varie crisi internazionali e nelle accuse di 
facilitare i crimini di guerra. In particolare, durante il Genocidio del
 Ruanda nel 1994, le aziende di difesa israeliane sono state accusate di
 aver fornito attrezzature militari - tra cui sistemi radar, veicoli e 
armi da fuoco - alle fazioni responsabili delle uccisioni di massa dei 
Tutsi. Situazioni simili si sono verificate nel 2013 in Sudan, dove le 
armi israeliane sarebbero state nelle mani di milizie sudanesi coinvolte
 nell'esecuzione di civili e nella distruzione di villaggi. La 
situazione della minoranza Rohingya in Myanmar nel 2016-2017 esemplifica
 ulteriormente questa tendenza, con l'esercito di Myanmar che utilizza 
armi da fuoco e munizioni israeliane nelle sue operazioni. Inoltre, 
l'esportazione di tecnologia militare da parte di Israele si estende al 
regno della sorveglianza e del controllo digitale, con strumenti di 
cyberspionaggio sviluppati da Israele, come Pegasus, che vengono 
utilizzati da regimi con registri dei diritti umani dubbi. Regimi arabi 
come gli Emirati Arabi Uniti e l'Arabia Saudita hanno utilizzato queste 
tecnologie per monitorare e reprimere il dissenso sia all'interno dei 
loro confini che tra le comunità di espatriati.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Conclusione
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   Gli eventi genocidi a Gaza servono a ricordare il ciclo radicato di 
violenza e oppressione intrinseco al progetto coloniale israeliano. 
Quest'ultimo assalto non è un incidente isolato, ma piuttosto 
emblematico di un continuum storico che risale alla Nakba del 1948 e che
 si è perpetuato nei decenni successivi di conflitto e ostilità contro 
la popolazione palestinese. Alla base di questo modello di aggressione 
c'è il ruolo cruciale svolto dal complesso militare-industriale di 
Israele, un apparato sfaccettato che non solo consente, ma trae 
attivamente profitto dalla perpetuazione del colonialismo di 
insediamento.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Le implicazioni di vasta portata del complesso militare-industriale 
israeliano si estendono ben oltre il contesto immediato della Palestina.
 Il suo impatto destabilizzante pone gravi minacce alla regione e alla 
pace e alla sicurezza mondiale, e fondamentalmente sfida i principi di 
autodeterminazione e di giustizia sanciti dal diritto internazionale. 
Come tale, la risposta della comunità internazionale al colonialismo di 
insediamento israeliano e ai meccanismi con i quali esso esercita 
l'oppressione e la guerra richiede un'azione multilaterale urgente e 
coordinata per imporre il boicottaggio, il disinvestimento e le sanzioni
 contro Israele.

  Hereby we publish an unofficial translation of
  <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/oaxaca-sin-agua-sequia-o-saqueo/">
   an article
  </a>
  found in the Mexican website Periódico Mural.
 </p>
<p>
  During the last few months, more than 4,326 hectares of land were affected by terrible forest fires caused by the latifundium or surged as a phenomenon during the dry season. Additionally in various regions of Oaxaca such as the Valles Centrales, Mixteca and Costa, mainly, has been seen a water crisis that threatens entire populations, and now also public hospitals and schools.
 </p>
<p>
  The clear example is the situation of the General Hospital “Dr. Aurelio Valdivieso”, in the Oaxacan capital’s center, which on 22
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of February suspend work after running out of water. Obviously a hospital cannot function without providing minimum health conditions for patients and medical staff, and therefore the drinking water service is essential. In this regard, the Defender of Human Rights of the Oaxaca’s People began a precedents notebook and issued precautionary measures requesting
  <em>
   “comprehensive actions from the State
  </em>
<em>
   in order to
  </em>
<em>
   avoid causing damage that is difficult or impossible to repair
  </em>
<em>
   in
  </em>
<em>
   detriment of citizens’ right to health.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Now, in the same capital of the entity, it is reported that at least 6 public schools had to suspend work and return to online classes due to the total shortage of water in their facilities. The most recent have been the “Carlos A. Carrillo” Urban Morning Primary School, located in Colonia Reforma, and the “Enrique Pestalozzi” Morning Primary School, located in the City’s Center. Leaving children without access to drinking water within their schools also violates their right to education and health, among others contemplated within the best interests of children.
 </p>
<p>
  Until a few weeks ago, the shortage of drinking water was concentrated in the popular neighborhoods generally located on the periphery and hills of the city, nothing new. For decades there have been dozens of neighborhoods called “illegal settlements” where poor people do not have access to drinking water or other public services; hundreds of small schools are in the same situation in those same neighborhoods. The different governments in power have systematically ignored this situation, leaving the solution in the hands of the residents who have had to hire private pipes which take advantage of the dry season to speculate on water prices.
 </p>
<p>
  But now that the water crisis has reached the central area of the City and the “good” neighborhoods such as Reforma, San Felipe, etc. the situation has become a scandal; even more so when visible public institutions such as the General Hospital and the before mentioned schools had to suspend work due to the water shortage.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, in Oaxaca, soft drink companies and brewery companies continue to work normally, as do large hotels, restaurants, vice-centers and even spas that are preparing for Holy Week and beautiful tourism. None of these have a lack of water at all.
 </p>
<p>
  Are we facing a phenomenon of drought or looting? You can answer.
 </p>
<p>
  If during the pandemic a health emergency and suspension of work was declared for these industries and businesses, the same should be done in the midst of this water crisis, which is also a health crisis, besides to regulating the price of water sold by pipers organized in union mafias.
 </p>
<p>
  Guaranteeing universal access to drinking water as a fundamental right is a vital necessity and not the upcoming elections. The money spent on campaigns and candidates should be invested in community water collection and supply systems for the people.

<p>
<strong>
   Imperialism spreads out its claws
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The imperialist boots, of a different stripe, invade Ecuador, hunting for our land, natural resources, cheap labor, market (mainly arms), colluding and struggling for the distribution of the world. In Ecuador we face the expansion of the extractive mining monopoly.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialism, through transnational mining companies, spits out their narratives like poison, they say that they come with progress, sources of employment, industrialization, wealth, among other fallacies. The viper has little or no interest in the well-being of the oppressed peoples, on the contrary, their colonizing practices and their desire to get rich at any cost are obvious.
 </p>
<p>
  Those paper tigers want to break into Ecuador because the labor rights are violated and thus satiate themselves with other people’s work. So, mining companies are guaranteed cheap labor with relations of semi-feudal production. The bourgeois/landlord government of Noboa is going further beyond being a representative of the big comprador bourgeois faction, it is the incarnation of feudalism, a big landlord raised in the image and likeness of the Yankees to reproduce feudality, gamonalism, servitude, unpaid labor and semi-coloniality.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Invasion of Palo Quemado-Las Pampas
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The governments in power, since the fascist Correa, passing through Moreno, Lasso and today the big landlord of Noboa, together with other institutions of the old state, have bowed their heads before their imperialist masters. They have provided all the conditions for them to dispossess the lands of the peasant.
 </p>
<p>
  What is happening in Palo Quemado-Las Pampas of Sigchos, Cotopaxi province, is nothing more than the imperialist imposition of bureaucratic capitalism (semi-colonial/semi-feudal), they granted concessions of 2,200 hectares of Palo Quemado and Las Pampas in favor of the mining company La Plata SA, owned by Atico Mining Corporation SA, now it enters in the peasant communities with the aim of concentrating the land, exploiting minerals such as gold, silver, copper, among others.
 </p>
<p>
  Bureaucrats of the Ministry of the Environment and employees of the La Plata SA mining company have taken the task of carrying out mediocre workshops and socialization talks, distracting from the true social and environmental impact, offering sources of work, training, vaccines for children, education, trucks and machinery, simply trying to buy consciences. They do it in front of a few clueless and traitorous residents, under the pretext of a supposed socialization of the mining project, with that mechanism they enter the people to divide and oppose them.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Anti-imperialist resistance
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The old state activated its repressive apparatus on March 19 and 20, members of the National Police and Armed Forces, according to complaints from community members, in coordination with paramilitary mafias at the service of imperialism and power groups, attacked the peasantry. Furthermore, the State Attorney General’s Office criminalized the right to resist and protest, prosecuting around 72 community members, unusually, for the crime of terrorism.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite all the repression and persecution, the brave masses have resisted belligerently, the peasants carry out struggles to expel the invader, they burned two vehicles of imperialist lackeys and injured six police and military personnel.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Down with consultations and bourgeois/big landlord institutionality
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The farce of the previous, free and informed consults, popular elections, elections and spurious bourgeois democracy is developed. For example, the popular consultation for not exploiting the Yasuní ITT, what use has it been? What is the utility of electing an executioner as president every four years? The mining socializations in the Las Naves canton, what they were useful for? They only serve to numb popular struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  The traitors, revisionists, reformists and opportunists try to take the people’s struggle to the abyss, leading the masses into the electoral and institutional abyss, pushing them towards prior, free and informed consultation, which is rigged in favor of imperialist mining, that legitimize the invasion and becomes the extinguisher of the sparks of resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  We should not romanticize the struggle of oppressed peoples, this goes beyond water, nature, nor is an issue for indigenous people, mixed races, blacks or whites. Let’s open our eyes, the world is going through several imperialist invasions against oppressed peoples.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialism wants to take over our main means of production, the land and everything it contains, expelling our peasants from their lands. So, the people of Palo Quemado-Las Pampas, their main contradiction is against imperialism, against semi-feudality and against bureaucratic capitalism, in that order.
 </p>
<p>
  We cannot trust anything from the institutions of the old state, they are all at the service of imperialism and the groups in power, not even the Armed Forces and National Police that point their weapons at the poorest in the country for the benefit of the exploiter. And they will not hesitate to pull the trigger. On the other hand, there is the proletariat, the poor peasants, the democratic intellectuals, the brave people, who undertake the anti-imperialist struggle for the land.

 Κάθε χρόνο στις 25 Μάρτη, η αστική προπαγάνδα προσπαθεί να φουσκώσει τα μυαλά της νεολαίας και του λαού με μεγαλοϊδεατισμούς δεμένους με θρησκευτική "ανάταση" (ενότητα έθνους και εκκλησίας), ψεύτηκες αφηγήσεις και εθνικιστικές παράτες. Είναι επομένως αναγκαίο, πολιτικοί και κοινωνικοί χώροι σαν τη "Ρωγμή", που θέλουν να τοποθετούνται με την πλευρά του λαού, της δικιάς του ιστορίας και των επαναστατικών του παραδόσεων, να αναλαμβάνουν πρωτοβουλίες απάντησης σε όλο αυτό το βομβαρδισμό.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Η επιλογή παρουσίασης του βιβλίου "200+1 χρόνια μετά", κινήθηκε προς αυτή την κατεύθυνση, αυτό το σκοπό επεδίωξε να ικανοποιήσει και τελικά -από το αποτέλεσμα- δικαιώθηκε.
 </p>
<p>
  Η παρουσίαση έγινε στο χώρο του βιβλιοπωλείου "ΔΥΟ" την Παρασκευή 22 Μάρτη. Το σύντομο αλλά πολύ ουσιαστικό "άνοιγμα" της εκδήλωσης έκανε η συν. Σίσσυ Πανίδου, και στη συνέχεια ο -ένας εκ των δύο- συγγραφέας Δημήτρης Μάνος, έκανε μια εμπεριστατωμένη και συνεκτική ανάλυση των χαρακτηριστικών και των ιδιομορφιών της ελληνικής επανάστασης του 1821, των κοινωνικών ομάδων που πήραν μέρος σ' αυτήν και του ρόλου των μεγάλων δυνάμεων.
 </p>
<p>
  Η εισήγηση δημιούργησε το έδαφος για μια πλούσια συζήτηση, που όμως δεν μπόρεσε να εξελιχθεί σε όλο της το εύρος λόγω περιορισμένου χρόνου από το βιβλιοπωλείο, ενώ πέρασε και στο σήμερα και τις ανάγκες που γεννά η βαρβαρότητα του συστήματος και η επίθεσή του σε ευρύτατα στρώματα της σημερινής ελληνικής κοινωνίας. Η σημαντικότερη ίσως συμβολή της εισήγησης ήταν ότι γέννησε τη διάθεση για περισσότερη μελέτη και συζήτηση, τόσο σε νεολαίους όσο και σε μεγαλύτερους, γεγονός που αποτυπώθηκε και στις πωλήσεις του βιβλίου.

  This last week new clashes have erupted between the old Indian State and the peasants. The struggle of these last ones, far away from being a specific phenomenon in Punjab-Haryana, is a constant struggle in the whole country, between the peasantry and the old bureaucratic-big landlord Indian State. In the last weeks, there are news of the peasant struggle in many places of the country.

  the peasants made a mass protest to interrupt the railway traffic in the country, affecting Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana. The protests were made in at least 95 places in Punjab and another three places in Haryana. In all, 49 trains were affected, 9 of them being canceled. Other many trains made shortened ways. This affected not only the regional or intercity routes, but also the main transport routes. People were detained in Haryana and Rajasthan.

  it was clearly seen how the peasant protests are not a specific phenomenon but something usual also in other parts of India. In this occasion the peasantry protested in Byadgi, Karnataka, state of Mysore. The peasants protested there due to the low prices of some of the crops, mainly chili. The buying price of this product in the local markets had decreased by almost 50% from one day to another. The peasants protested and attacked the office of the Agricultural Production Market Committee (APMC), setting it ablaze, as well as police vehicles and they pushed back the intervention by the repressive forces.

  The last news of a clash between the Indian peasantry and the old State has occurred in the Buxar district, Bihar. On

  </a>
  the peasants of the area protested against the construction of a thermic energy plant. The peasants protested against the lack of economical compensation after the confiscation of their lands, as well as for the lack of alternatives of employment. The police brutally charged against the protesters, and this is clearly seen in the recordings of the scene and this has upset the whole local population. The peasants bravely resisted and it is reported that there are more than 20 police officers injured, as well as 30 peasants been detained.
 </p>
<p>
  While the imperialists mass media mainly focuses in the farmer’s and peasants protests in Europe, the peasant struggle in India and other oppressed countries is being ignored, and often hidden. However this struggle has a fundamental character and is sharpening in all the semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries, as the struggle of the peasantry against the latifundium, monopolies and the bureaucratic-big landlord states is key for the liberation of the peoples of the world and the struggle against imperialism.

It should be noted that Haiti has a population of 11 million people, that means that almost half of the country is in serious trouble to eat properly. These figures are not a direct consequence of the current Haitian situation, but are part of the structural poverty of Haiti, a direct consequence of its condition as a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, oppressed by imperialism, mainly by the yoke of Yankee imperialism, which has a long history of interventions in the country. The next intervention is already going on and recently the United States’ Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has announced that the

  Imperialist interventions have been frequent during Haiti’s history. Its subjugation and its condition as an oppressed country is evident. The Haitian economy has been in debt since the beginning of its history as a State. After formal independence from the French empire beginning in 1804 when Haitian slaves expelled the French colonizers, these used a war fleet

  the relationship of subjugation of Haiti towards American interests started, with the entry of Yankee financial capital on the island.

   In 1915
  </a>
  the US militarily occupied the island, keeping the troops in Haiti for 19 years. From that moment onward, the Yankees controlled the island’s budget directly until 1947, to ensure that Haiti would pay a new debt, this time acquired by the United States. Until that year Haiti used half of its Gross Domestic Product to pay its debts to France and the United States. During direct Yankee control, policies of social cuts were applied and the looting of the country began, sinking it into even deeper poverty than what they suffered from payments to their former French masters.

   Yankee dominance remained intact from the 1950s

  , when they abandoned the direct occupation of Haiti. The country entered in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, financial organizations created and controlled by Yankee imperialism. Haiti currently has debts with them. After this, serious attacks were carried out against the people that reduced a lot their democratic rights and their access to basic services such as education, health, food, etc. These deficiencies are still very present today and largely explain the vulnerability of the Haitian people facing any type of health crisis, natural crisis or any other type of crisis. To ensure the subjugation of the Haitian people to the interests of Yankee imperialism, a terrible regime led by its lackeys was established, first François “Papa Doc” Duvalier, and later his son Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier. A fact that may seem an anecdote, but that serves as an example of this total subjugation to Yankee imperialism, is that in the 70s

   Haiti became the largest producer of baseballs in the world
  </a>
  , exporting 20 million balls a year. Yankee imperialism supported a brutal dictatorship that, under the command of “Papa Doc” Duvalier, saw the birth of a paramilitary force of 60,000 soldiers, known as “Tonton Macoute”, which terrorized and repressed the people as much as was necessary to keep the interests of the ruling classes and Yankee imperialism intact. With the fall of “Baby Doc” Duvalier in 1986 at the hands of a popular revolt, many of the paramilitary leaders were executed by the people.

  After this revolt, Yankee imperialism maneuvered to maintain its dominance over the oppressed country.

This president applied harsh anti-popular measures in his first term and was established in power directly by Yankee troops (more than 20,000 soldiers), who were directly occupying the country from 1994 to 2000. Aristide, in his second term from 2001 to 2004 he applied new harsh measures against the people. Masses rose up against

   these measures demanded by the IMF
  </a>
  , i.e. Yankee imperialism, which Aristide was applying and the lackey of Yankee imperialism was overthrown in 2004. The bourgeois media described his overthrow as a coup d’état and an intervention by gangs and criminals. After this revolt, Yankee imperialism once again militarily occupied the country along with troops of its lackeys. After this first direct occupation from Yankee troops, then came the troops of the so-called “peacekeeping” or blue helmets from the UN, among which the Brazilian troops and other lackeys of Yankee imperialism
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/07/haiti-foreign-intervention-history-peacekeeper/">
   portrayed an infamous role
  </a>
  . There were numerous massacres against the Haitian people, even diseases were intentionally spread against the people, such as the use of cholera spread by Prachanda’s Nepalese troops.

   The newspaper AND pointed out
  </a>
  how the Brazilian repressive forces committed crimes against the Haitian people and learned how to apply their terrorist methods against the Brazilian people, especially how to apply new repressive methods in the favelas. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was present in the country until 2017.

  The interests of Yankee financial capital have continued to be present in Haiti. In 2021 instability grew again in the Caribbean country when President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by Colombian mercenaries,

   trained and financed within the framework of “Plan Colombia”
  </a>
  , financed by Yankee imperialism as part of its terror plan against the Colombian people and their revolts against the old State. Additionally Yankee imperialism was able to take advantage of these mercenaries for other destabilization plans, as was the case in Haiti. In this way, it was possible to perpetuate instability in the country, eliminate an obstacle to centralize and corporatize power even more, and thus to be able to deal with the growing protests and popular revolts in the country, which could put at risk the status quo of subjugation to Yankee imperialism. Ariel Henry laid the first stone,

   asking in 2022 for “help”
  </a>
  and police intervention to fight the gangs in Haiti. Subsequently, Yankee imperialism has prepared the future intervention that will take place in the country. The intervention that is being proposed will not be carried out directly by Yankee imperialism but they will rather use its lackeys for this purpose, just as was done with MINUSTAH. In this case Kenya will have a center role by sending thousands of police officers, and other countries such as Benin, Bangladesh, Chad, Barbados, Belize and Antigua and Barbuda have pledged that they will send troops.

   The President of Kenya, William Ruto, has remained faithful to Yankee imperialism
  </a>
  and has said that he will send the repressive forces when there is a government established in Haiti, that is, when the Transitional Council will be functioning. For this reason, Yankee imperialism has finally set up its plan of military occupation of Haiti: first Ariel Henry had to resign, then the new government or provisional authority has to be formed, and after that it would have legitimacy within the framework of bourgeois law, to receive the occupying troops at the service of Yankee imperialism. The next step will be the election of a new central authority, which will willingly accept to welcome the occupiers and serve to the Yankee interests.

  Haiti’s history is an example of the struggle of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world against imperialism and an example of the countless crimes and atrocities committed by imperialism. It is an example of how the imperialists have treated and treat those who have rebelled, those who have dared to fight and win. It is an example of how the Haitian people have been struggling against Yankee imperialism throughout the 20
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  century and the beginning of the 21
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  century, and how the emergence of the paramilitaries, the misery suffered by the masses and the total absence of social services, all of them are direct consequences of the role of imperialism and its local lackeys in the country.
 </p>
<p>
  The Haitians dared to fight and win when between 1791 and 1804 they rebelled against the Spanish, English and French colonizers, took power for the first time in history, and expelled their former French masters and abolishing slavery. Since that moment, imperialism has had Haiti in its point of view. The history of Haiti is the history of an oppressed country by imperialism, mainly Yankee. The USA have not only treated the country as a territory of conquest, with multiple military occupations and interference. Yankee imperialism has also turned Haiti into its particular testing ground in the field of counter-insurgency, allowing its lackeys to train their tactics and methods against the Haitian people and then put them into practice against their own people who rebel in their own countries. Faced with the revolts of the Haitian people in recent decades, imperialism does not forgive and is already preparing to sink the country in blood again. Now the Haitian people have in their hands to do not allow Yankee imperialism to once again take the control of their fate. Now the Haitian people have in their hands to free themselves from the imperialist oppressors and their local lackeys, and thus remember the feat accomplished in 1804.
