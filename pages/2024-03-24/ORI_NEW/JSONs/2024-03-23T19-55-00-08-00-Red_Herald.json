Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is \ninadmissible where: \n(a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State \nis unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution; \n6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.\n\n\n11\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not \nto prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of \nthe State genuinely to prosecute; \n(c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and \na trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3; \n(d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court.\n2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the \nprinciples of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as \napplicable: \n(a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of \nshielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the \nCourt referred to in article 5; \n(b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent \nwith an intent to bring the person concerned to justice; \n(c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or \nare being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring \nthe person concerned to justice.\n3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or \nsubstantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused \nor the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings. \nArticle 18  \nPreliminary rulings regarding admissibility\n1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined \nthat there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an \ninvestigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those \nStates which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the \ncrimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor \nbelieves it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of \npersons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States. \n2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has \ninvestigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute \ncrimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At \nthe request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the \nPre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation. \n3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months \nafter the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based \non the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation. \n4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial \nChamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis. \n5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may \nrequest that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and \nany subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay. \n6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation \nunder this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber \nto pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique \nopportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be \nsubsequently available. \n7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the \nadmissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change \nof circumstances. \n\n\n12\nRome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19  \nChallenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case\n1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own \nmotion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17.\n2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the \njurisdiction of the Court may be made by: \n(a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under \narticle 58; \n(b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the \ncase or has investigated or prosecuted; or \n(c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12.\n3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In \nproceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article \n13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court. \n4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or \nState referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the \ntrial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than \nonce or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the \ncommencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17, \nparagraph 1 (c). \n5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity. \n6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the \njurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges, \nthey shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be \nappealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82. \n7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the \ninvestigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17. \n8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court: \n(a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6; \n(b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of \nevidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and \n(c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the \nProsecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58.\n9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order \nor warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge. \n10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for \na review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis \non which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17. \n11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor \nmay request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That \ninformation shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides \nto proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has \ntaken place. \n\n\n13\nRome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207 \nNe bis in idem\n1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which \nformed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court. \n2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has \nalready been convicted or acquitted by the Court. \n3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall \nbe tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court: \n(a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within \nthe jurisdiction of the Court; or \n(b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due \nprocess recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, \nwas inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.\nArticle 21  \nApplicable law\n1. The Court shall apply: \n(a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence; \n(b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international \nlaw, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict; \n(c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the \nworld including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction \nover the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with \ninternational law and internationally recognized norms and standards.\n2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions. \n3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally \nrecognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as \ndefined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, \nnational, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status. \n7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).\n\n\n14\nRome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.  \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW\nArticle 22  \nNullum crimen sine lege\n1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes, \nat the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court. \n2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of \nambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law \nindependently of this Statute. \nArticle 23  \nNulla poena sine leg e\nA person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute.\nArticle 24  \nNon-retroactivity ratione personae\n1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the \nStatute. \n2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more \nfavourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply.\nArticle 258 \nIndividual criminal responsibility\n1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute.\n2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and \nliable for punishment in accordance with this Statute. \n3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a \ncrime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person: \n(a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person, \nregardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible; \n(b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted; \n(c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its \ncommission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission; \n(d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group \nof persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either: \n(i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group, \nwhere such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of \nthe Court; or \n(ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime; \n(e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide; \n(f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a \nsubstantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's \nintentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents \nthe completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to \ncommit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose.\n8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).\n\n\n15\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position \neffectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State.\n4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of \nStates under international law. \nArticle 26  \nExclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen\nThe Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged \ncommission of a crime. \nArticle 27  \nIrrelevance of official capacity\n1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, \nofficial capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected \nrepresentative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under \nthis Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence. \n2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under \nnational or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person.\nArticle 28  \nResponsibility of commanders and other superiors\nIn addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the \nCourt: \n(a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally \nresponsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her \neffective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his \nor her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where: \n(i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time, \nshould have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and \n(ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures \nwithin his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the \ncompetent authorities for investigation and prosecution. \n(b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall \nbe criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates \nunder his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control \nproperly over such subordinates, where: \n(i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that \nthe subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes; \n(ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the \nsuperior; and \n(iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to \nprevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for \ninvestigation and prosecution.\nArticle 29  \nNon-applicability of statute of limitations\nThe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations. \nArticle 30  \nMental element\n1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge. \n2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where: \n(a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; \n\n\n16\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will \noccur in the ordinary course of events.\n3. For the purposes of this article, \"knowledge\" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence \nwill occur in the ordinary course of events. \"Know\" and \"knowingly\" shall be construed accordingly.\nArticle 31  \nGrounds for excluding criminal responsibility\n1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall \nnot be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct: \n(a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate \nthe unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform \nto the requirements of law; \n(b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the \nunlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the \nrequirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances \nthat the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely \nto engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court; \n(c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war \ncrimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which \nis essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force \nin a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property \nprotected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall \nnot in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph; \n(d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been \ncaused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious \nbodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably \nto avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one \nsought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be: \n(i) Made by other persons; or \n(ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control.\n2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for \nin this Statute to the case before it. \n3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to \nin paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures \nrelating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. \nArticle 32  \nMistake of fact or mistake of law\n1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element \nrequired by the crime. \n2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court \nshall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for \nexcluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided \nfor in article 33. \nArticle 33  \nSuperior orders and prescription of law\n1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an \norder of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal \nresponsibility unless: \n(a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question; \n(b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and \n(c) The order was not manifestly unlawful.\n2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. \n\n\n17\nRome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.  \nCOMPOSITION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE COURT\nArticle 34  \nOrgans of the Court\nThe Court shall be composed of the following organs: \n(a) The Presidency; \n(b) An Appeals Division, a Trial Division and a Pre-Trial Division; \n(c) The Office of the Prosecutor; \n(d) The Registry.\nArticle 35  \nService of judges\n1.

The Presidency may, on the basis of the workload of the Court and in consultation with its members, decide \nfrom time to time to what extent the remaining judges shall be required to serve on a full-time basis. Any \nsuch arrangement shall be without prejudice to the provisions of article 40. \n4. The financial arrangements for judges not required to serve on a full-time basis shall be made in accordance \nwith article 49.\nArticle 36  \nQualifications, nomination and election of judges\n1.

The proposal shall be considered adopted if approved at the \nmeeting by a vote of two thirds of the members of the Assembly of States Parties and shall enter into \nforce at such time as decided by the Assembly of States Parties. \n(c) (i) Once a proposal for an increase in the number of judges has been adopted under subparagraph  \n (b), the election of the additional judges shall take place at the next session of the Assembly of  \n States Parties in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 8, and article 37, paragraph 2; \n(ii) Once a proposal for an increase in the number of judges has been adopted and brought \ninto effect under subparagraphs (b) and (c) (i), it shall be open to the Presidency at any time \nthereafter, if the workload of the Court justifies it, to propose a reduction in the number \nof judges, provided that the number of judges shall not be reduced below that specified in \nparagraph 1. The proposal shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedure laid down in \nsubparagraphs (a) and (b). In the event that the proposal is adopted, the number of judges shall \nbe progressively decreased as the terms of office of serving judges expire, until the necessary \nnumber has been reached. \n3.

As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that \nthe Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons \nis sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions \nrestricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The \nsummons shall contain: \n(a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information; \n(b) The specified date on which the person is to appear; \n(c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to \nhave committed; and \n(d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.\nThe summons shall be served on the person. \n\n\n28\nRome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 59  \nArrest proceedings in the custodial State\n1.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for \ninterim release pending surrender. \n4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider \nwhether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify \ninterim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty \nto surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State \nto consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a) \nand (b). \n5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations \nto the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give \nfull consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the \nescape of the person, before rendering its decision. \n6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status \nof the interim release. \n7.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber \nis satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be \ndetained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions. \n3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and \nmay do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify \nits ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so \nrequire. \n4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial \ndue to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the \nperson, with or without conditions. \n5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who \nhas been released. \nArticle 61  \nConfirmation of the charges before trial\n1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary \nappearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which \nthe Prosecutor intends to seek trial.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall: \n(a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to \nbring the person to trial; and \n(b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.\n The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the \nhearing. \n4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges. \nThe person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of \ncharges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons \nfor the withdrawal. \n5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial \ngrounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary \nor summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial. \n6. At the hearing, the person may: \n(a) Object to the charges; \n(b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and \n(c) Present evidence.\n7.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from \nsubsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence. \n9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission \nof the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to \nadd additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those \ncharges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial \nChamber, withdraw the charges. \n10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been \nconfirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. \n\n\n30\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court11.

Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54, \nparagraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73. \n4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at \nany stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security \ninterests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance \nwith this article. \n5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all \nreasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or \nthe Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative \nmeans. Such steps may include: \n(a) Modification or clarification of the request; \n(b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a \ndetermination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a \nsource other than the requested State; \n(c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or \n(d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other \nthings, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte  \nproceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure \nand Evidence.\n6.

If it determines that the \napplication is meritorious, it may, as appropriate: \n(a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber; \n(b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or \n\n\n41\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter,\nwith a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, \narriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised. \nArticle 85  \nCompensation to an arrested or convicted person\n1.

Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion, \npending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for \nextradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that \nthe case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis. \n4.

Where execution of a particular measure of assistance detailed in a request presented under paragraph \n1, is prohibited in the requested State on the basis of an existing fundamental legal principle of general \napplication, the requested State shall promptly consult with the Court to try to resolve the matter. In the \nconsultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner \nor subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the \nrequest as necessary. \n4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the \nrequest concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national \nsecurity. \n5.
