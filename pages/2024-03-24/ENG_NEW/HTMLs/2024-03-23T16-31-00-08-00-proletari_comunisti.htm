   In a process whose value is only political. The Public Prosecutor of the Hungarian State wants to send a message to all the European anti -Nazi and left movements: do not come to manifest by us, we are a country where anti -comprehensive manifestations are not welcome, we are not a country that welcomes dissent against neonazians so go On the other hand, to demonstrate, if you come here you will suffer the fate of Ilaria Salis and of his other companions who find themselves imprisoned at this moment.

   It was discussed in Turin, during an interesting meeting organized at the Casa del Popolo Estella, to remember what is happening, Ilaria's father spoke about it,

   , who retraced the judicial drama that his daughter is experiencing. The inhuman conditions of detention both at the hygienic and prison regime level since for 35 days in Ilaria the right to speak with anyone has not been granted; The procedural procedure that highlights the accused's violation of the essential rights of the essential rights. Everything highlights the compromise of the right of defense in a story that seems to come from a place very far from the rule of law that should characterize the Member States of the European Union.

    The debate continued with the intervention of
    <b>
     Francesca Tractered
    </b>
    , lawyer, observer for the research and processing center for democracy in the Salis process, which immediately highlighted how the Ilaria Salis affair represents a real black hole of political democracy and the just trial. An inhuman and degrading treatment that configures a torture considering that for international regulations 15 days of prolonged insulation constitute to all intents and purposes torture and Ilaria has undergone an insulation for 35 days, but above all it is not serving any sentence but only preventive prison. Even the same procedural procedure does not guarantee in any way the right of defense of Ilaria nor the impartiality of a judge who has already issued a condemnation decision against a German co -defendant in the same process of Ilaria.

    Orban's Hungary is a black anti -democratic shadow that stains Europe, which in Italy finds bank in the friend's friend who has fiercely appealed to the independence of the judiciary, to the autonomy of the judges, knowing well that Hungary It has much to learn in terms of separation of powers and respect for essential human rights.
