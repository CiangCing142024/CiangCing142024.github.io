  <p>
   A few weeks ago the VIII Cong Congress was held in the city of Bogotá, prior to this, the Congress of Youth and that of CUT women was held.
  </p>
  <p p="">
   <p>
    Meanwhile, the Cut Congress did give him a decision and by delegates, with the aggravating man who arrived the documents already made and machine to show a majority that approved them. They also invited the Minister of Labor and the Deputy Minister, despite being criticized by the base workers, because although they were unionists, they are now part of the State institutions that are at the service of the capitalists regardless of their intentions.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is obvious that, if they do not allow them to speak to those who dare to criticize, union democracy is not being exercised, and a always majority approves the conclusions that are already machined from above. In this way, the new delegates, especially from other cities, believe that this is the way of working in the trade union movement, ignoring that union democracy is too much from being that, because the minority must be allowed to defend their positions.
   </p>
   <p>
    That is why trade unionism, managed by bourgeois ideology does not serve the collective interests of the working class, so far it has only served to promote those bureaucrats in state positions, it has served for many leaders to turn the union into their Minor box, while the workers are orphaned and at the mercy of what the patterns want to do with them.
   </p>
   <p>
    That is why from these pages we have been denouncing that bourgeois policy of conciliation and concertation of classes, which are precisely the foundations of the CUT.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the political statement that presented as a final conclusion of the VIII Congress, it is claimed that the salary increase approved for this year was an achievement. Surely none of those bureaucrats earns a minimum wage, nor do they have The most brutal persecution for the bosses, most of the CUT bureaucracy no longer feels what it is to live with a pyrric minimum wage. That is, these bureaucracies do not represent the majority as they know, and do deceive and handle the workers preventing them from organizing with class independence and building their own organizations.
   </p>
   <p>
    The political statement of the CUT is just one more speech, but what they defend there is pure demagogy; That bureaucracy has become a machinery that does not allow it to be changed from the inside, it is similar to a tiny state, impossible to change because the State since it was created has the function of guaranteeing the privileges of the classes that have economic power, And in the case of the CUT, from birth it was tied by the ideology and politics of the bourgeoisie, which made it the engendro that is today.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is an immediate need for trade union organizations to cease to be behind a trade that can do the bureaucracies of union plants. The trade union movement must fight for their organization with independence of class and from the streets, with the complaint and protest to tear the vindications of the people to the bourgeoisie; But it is essential to act organized and centralized, under principles that represent its class, which returns to solidarity strikes.
   </p>
   <p>
    But this must be worked as aware and with a lot of commitment, understanding that the claims are solved collectively, really organized in independent federations, that they are the foundations of a true independent central for its ideology and politics at the service of workers and not of employers , a central one that directs the struggle of workers in improving their conditions, but not to stay as salaried slaves, but to have the strength to fight against capitalism, against wage exploitation and the construction of a new society, socialism .
