  At least five collecting lawsuits in various provinces of Canada are currently running against both doctors and the Canadian government due to the forced sterilization of indigenous women.
  <a href="/index.php/de/t-proletarischer-feminismus/7939-zwangssterilisationen-in-den-usa">
   Similar to the United States
  </a>
  Also grew in Canada the "Eugeniker" movement at the beginning of the 20th century, which openly explained to "control" the indigenous population by means of an infertility.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   The provinces of Alberta and British Columbia operated in the 20th century by the Eugeniker movement, sterilization programs initiated,
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   which, together with the "Indian Act" - a racist and still applicable law, that the indigenous people, the "first nations", grants significantly less rights than the "white" and for them provides for them -
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   suppress the development of the indigenous population
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   should
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   .
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   From the 1960s to the 1980s, the birth rate of the indigenous people in Canada fell from 47 to 28 percent.
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   The abolition of Eugenik laws began in the 1970s, but the increasing complaints and investigations of the past few years have shown that
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   that forced sterilization is still a common remedy for Canadian imperialism, ethnic purges compared to the almost five percent of the total population of Canada
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   to take.
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   L
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   On the bourgeois politician
  </span>
  Yvonne Boyer has had at least 12,000 cases of compulsory sterilizations in Canada since the 1970s - often women were ignorant about it over a long time:
  <em>
   “For example, we were not yet in the north. We know: 26 percent of women in iglooic were sterilized. They brought them south with ships, made mass sterilizations and brought them back. ”
  </em>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   Boyer is not the only bourgeois politician who the topic
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   picks up for their purposes - even the Senate, at least after after
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   the

  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   UN committee against torture
  </span>

   2018
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   Compared to the Canadian government
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   concern
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   expressed and
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   Investigations called for
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   indirectly the end of compulsory sterilization -
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   but
  </span>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   The crimes against the indigenous women continue to take place
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   and the state
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Covered this
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   consciously
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Or do all sorts of
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   not to let them public
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">

  <span style="font-weight: normal;">

   Last May was in Canada for the very first time
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   a doctor
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   for the unwanted sterilization of a woman "punished": in 2019 he had an indigenous one

  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Woman with abdominal pain both instead,
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   as agreed in writing,
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   removed an fallopian tube -
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   whereby he ignored the objections of the medical staff: his punishment: only

   five months loss of his license for one

  <span style="font-style: normal;">

    In another example, in 2001 a woman was brought back into anesthesia against her will after the birth of a healthy child, made stirring by nursing staff and against her will and that of her husband.
