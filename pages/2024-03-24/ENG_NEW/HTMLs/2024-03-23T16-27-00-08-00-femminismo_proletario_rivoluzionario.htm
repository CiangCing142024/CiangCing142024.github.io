    The 
 March 28 in Budapest, the second hearing that sees will be celebrated 
 Ilaria Salis charged
   </b>
   In a process whose value is only 
 politics. The Public Prosecutor of the Hungarian State wants to send a message 
 to all the European and leftist movements of European and left: do not come to 
 demonstrate with us, we are a country where antinazist manifestations 
 They are not welcome, we are not a country that welcomes dissent 
 Against the neo -Nazis then go to another part to manifest, if 
 Come here you will suffer the fate of Ilaria Salis and his other 
 companions who find themselves imprisoned at this moment.

 It is discussed in Turin, during an interesting meeting organized at the Casa del Popolo Estella, to remember what is happening, Ilaria's father spoke about it,
    <b>
     Roberto Salis
    </b>
    , who retraced the judicial drama 
 who is experiencing the daughter. The inhuman conditions of detention is a 
 hygienic level that at the prison regime level since for well 
 35 days in Ilaria the right to speak with 
 any; the procedural procedure that highlights the violation of the 
 essential rights of the accused - remember that to date ad 
 Ilaria was not given the opportunity to view the 
 evidence collected against him by the Hungarian prosecutor; everything highlights 
 the impairment of the right of defense in a story that seems 
 get from a place very far from the rule of law that 
 should characterize the Member States of the European Union.

    The 
 debate continued with the intervention of
    <b>
     Francesca Tractered
    </b>
    ,
lawyer, observer for the Research and Elaboration Centre for
Democracy in the Salis process, which immediately highlighted how
the story of Ilaria Salis represents a real black hole
political democracy and due process. A treatment
inhuman and degrading situation which constitutes torture in view of the fact that
International Regulations 15 Days of Prolonged Isolation
constitute to all intents and purposes torture and Ilaria has suffered a
isolation for 35 days, but above all he is not serving any
but only pre-trial detention. Also the same
procedural procedure does not in any way guarantee the right to
Ilaria's defence nor the impartiality of a judge who has already
sentenced a German co-defendant
in the same process as Ilaria.
