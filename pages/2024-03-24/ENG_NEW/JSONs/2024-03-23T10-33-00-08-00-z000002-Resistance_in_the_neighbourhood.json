We even suggested that we meet on Friday 15/3 to organize this concentration as best possible. This meeting was not made for various reasons. ELME not only did not participate but not even a resolution. The arguments of the SYNEK, the PEK and PAME were not only unacceptable but also ridiculous.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Eventually without particular fermentation and substantial intervention in schools, the gathering was made. Banners were involved in the racing movements of teachers, the left intervention, the left -wing concentration and the class course. Dozens of teachers and workers also responded. It was set up microphone, hundreds of notices were shared and there was a very good climate in the world's response. But in the end we couldn't make a demonstration.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We believe that our weaknesses and the possibilities that have been quite well in this mobilization must be concerned with all the forces we participated in. If we move more decisively in the next period for the serious issue of persecution (and not only) the result will be much better.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" class=\"b-hbp-video b-uploaded\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"266\" id=\"BLOGGER-video-03c8aca7147b53a6-13259\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" src=\"https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dxIDLkLOWgFGvZRdXiyBhPvVh_sAUedJeHTAEmwDu97i5WCJIRbMvV4BrD-eu2Arje1ebyoZaJMTpOnPkirDszTTAzqOC7vtTRVHwdNm38beMZPhQrC8I3XQup4LSJV2BmSPyOr\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" width=\"320\">\n  </iframe>\n </div>\n <br/>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 - \u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7", "\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2", "\u03b7\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_89.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
