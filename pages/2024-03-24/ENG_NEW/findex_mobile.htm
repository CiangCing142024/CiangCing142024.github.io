  We have now entered the sixth month of the Genocystic slaughter of the Zionist state of Israel against the people of Palestine in the Gaza Strip. The unstoppable daily bombings turn the area into ruins full of murdered civilians, while the Israeli war council was approved and the invasion of Rafa. At the same time, Israel uses hunger as a weapon against the Palestinian people, but also as many analysts point out, as a tool for pressure in negotiations with Hamas. In the same direction - the pressure - is used by the Zionists and the threat of the invasion of Rafa, which also reflects the will of the extreme reactionary group of Zionists ruled by Israel and has incorporated the practices of German Nazis into its policies.
 </p>
<p>
  Maximum aim of the Zionists, to use genocidal policy as a means of massively displacing Palestinians by the Gaza Strip. This goal, despite the suffering of the Palestinian people, is not easily achieved at all, not mainly because it finds the reactionary Arab regimes opposite to "do not load the problem". But because the people of Gaza persistently refuses to abandon the place where they live and become a refugee for the second time.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
<strong>
    USA: involvement and targets
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The subtitle does not refer to the US involvement in the massacre that evolves through continuing and massive power with every murderous iron from Zionist Israel. This continues and will continue, and is probably a lever, rumors that the US may stop military aid to Tel Aviv.
  </p>
<pem>
   The highest national priority now is to tackle the barbaric Zionist aggression and the genocidal and starvation war of the occupation against our people in the Gaza Strip and to deal with the crimes of its settlers on the West Bank and under Occupation Al-Kund . Jerusalem) -especially in the al -ACSA mosque -and the significant dangers facing our national case -at the forefront of which the evolving risk of displacement is located
   ».
  </pem>
</p>
<p>
  The Americans seem to want with a double replacement (Israeli, Palestinian Authority) to resurrect the plan of a Bandustan state for the Palestinians, the protectorate of Israel, the Arab regimes and of course their own and in the second year to open the way In the forefront of the Israeli-Arab regimes approach, aimed at Iran and in the background of Russia and China.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, as they are, they use "humanitarian aid" to obtain metaphorically and literally direct access to the Gaza Strip. With the Greek Cypriot leadership, double slavery in the US and Israel, and faithfully following the ruling class of our country, it has turned Cyprus into a Xionist vineyard and at the same time laying US plans for their presence in the region. Let us note here that through the "Amalthea" operation, only 200 tonnes of food were transferred to the lane, which can be carried by 10 trucks from land, at the same time that Israel refuses to enter the lane of hundreds of trucks from the crossing of Rafa.

  The Minister of Education of Germany says schools must prepare students for the possibility of war, at the same time that the local bourgeois political system is dancing to the rhythm of June. European Council President Charles Michelle proclaims that "if he wants peace, Europe needs to be prepared for war" and that we need to "go into war economy" while at the same time, the long -haired delusions and lies for lies for lies. The "Europe of the Peoples" are re -employed by the rulers to drag their peoples to the upcoming electoral farce. So here, domestic starry is getting ready to wear the "democratic" of the costumes, at the same time as plans to dress the world of work and youth in variations whenever required.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
    Continuing to the contradictions and inherent impasses, therefore, the European imperialist building is moving towards the ballot box to highlight its decorative instrument, to make it clear from its disgusting face, which has been widely revealed. For fiery reasons for "democracy" and "participation", the leaders of the imperialist metropolis are preparing to appear, who recently landed the army on the streets against the uprisings of their peoples and criminalized every expression of solidarity with the heroic. The protagonists of anti-communist memorandums and the equation of communism-nazism, which again nourish the darkest darkness of the past of human history, which have normalized fascism and war in the daily lives of their peoples, are preparing to talk about the "future". Political representatives of local capitalism are also followed by their feet.
   </p>
<p>
    Both the ND government and the other opposition bourgeois parties, then, are taking positions in view of the European elections. It could not be done otherwise, since beyond the need to integrate the people into the imperialist European ideals who have been called upon to serve over time, they also realize that they have to prove their attachment and give all sorts of credentials to Europeans 'patrons' "At a time, in fact, great geopolitical turmoil and strong imbalances in the latter's relations with the other transatlantic pillar of the country's dependency, American imperialists.
   </p>
<p p="">
<p>
     That is why, as shocking the grandeur of a parent who has lost his child and struggles for justification, so unforgivable is his miserable exploitation in the context of imperialist contradictions or the need for European bosses to consider their slaves! Even more, they are devastating for the working class, the people and the youth. The illusions that have been cultivated lately by the bourgeois opposition of SYRIZA, PASOK, the New Left and others, but also by the forces of the varied Left, that the EU and the EU and Her parliament is about the "guardian angel" of popular rights, that we will punish the "bad" government of Mitsotakis addressing the "good" Europeans who protect us.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, another that the left of the defeat and submission do not want! Characteristic of the case of the KKE, which is in a hurry to close the youth struggle to wear its electoral tie, with the local elections finished, turned her eyes there and all her action has revolved for months around the "mother" of battles. " Some organizations have even arrived to draw on Eurobonds in the midst of student uprising! All of them, in front of the election and delusions, are running once again to give their legitimacy to the ballot box of imperialist wolves and to assist in the struggle of the sovereigns against the "curse" abstention!
    </p>
<p>
     Because the forces of the system of dependence and exploitation are well aware that in today's phase they are marching in the incandescent territory of social wrath and indignation that is increasingly expanding and multiplying on existing terms of volatility of the urban political scene. Thus, in the tricks produced by the geopolitical position of our bourgeoisie, but also, in relation to the previous one, in the vibration of a diverted bumpy economy, which stands weak in front of "extrinsic threats", according to a recent report by JP Morgan, The data of the rage of the "below" will be constantly added.
    </p>
<p>
     The massive disapproval of the cover -up of the Tempi Inquiry Committee is precisely. With poverty and poverty spread out, with capitalist accuracy kneeling the social majority, with the government announcing the end of various benefits and passes and submission to "fiscal stability", with the people being exiled to hospitals and hospitals and hospitals. Any ability to access health care, with the long -awaited increase in the minimum wage proven to be a mockery that has already disappeared, it is clear that waves of dissatisfaction are being formed in the popular masses, which can be controlled, as long as they are struggling to be trapped in the ballot box. and in painless or even dangerous solutions.
    </p>
<p>
     The brutality of the repressive forces against students who insist on occupations against the Pierrakakis law, threats to imprisonment against the "unruly" teachers who deny evaluation proves that the lawmakers will be more and more often resorted to "To halt the social processes that are evolving, because they simply have no choice. "In front of the law the road is not allowed" is the message they seek to send, because this outlet is scared!
    </p>
<p>
     We have to strengthen this way out! By gathering the forces and fighters who insist that nothing is over, that the struggle for the overthrow of the Pierrakakis law must continue, that the common front of the common front of workers and youth. With the coincidence of those tendencies who refuse to legitimize the miserable construct of the Eurocup of the imperialists, shouting everywhere the choice of the electoral farce, showing the path of the mass struggle against the EU and NATO bonds. To finally serve the prospect of the confrontation of the working class, the people and the youth with the regime of imperialist dependence, the prospect of revolutionary overthrow of exploitation and social liberation!

<p>
  After completing the work of the House of Inquiry Committee on the Crime of Tempi, based on the publicity of the signatures issue and with the recent black anniversary and anger of the world expressed in the strike on 28 February, the climate of the climate. It was burdened for the government and made it difficult for the concealment operation.
 </p>
<p>
  The government, as expected, passed on the counterattack and moved on two main axes: first accused the opposition of tooling tragedy and using the dead and pain of their relatives in its political confrontation with it (political leeches, the government described them. Marinakis). And secondly, he was presented as the only one who could truly satisfy the request of the relatives and the whole people, for complete clarification of the case and punishment of the perpetrators with real and objective elements.
 </p>
<p>
  Mitsotakis himself also moved in these directions in his interview with SKAI. Taking the well -known, apparently multipurpose "human" communication staff, he said he did not forget the images and smells the next day, when he went to the scene of the crime, which was imposed by the human need to support the cranes somewhere for the crime. to lift the wagons and restore the carcasses. His humanity was exhausted somewhere there, because he was very cynical when he said that the railway is as safe as he could be, without excluding, in fact, other dead in the future ...
 </p>
<p>
  The same directions were followed, with relatively aggressive tones, the government in the debate in Parliament on the finding of the examination, namely ND! A finding that he found no other responsible despite the human factor and ... the evil at a time when they were brought up and became looming mistakes and omissions that led to the conflict.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, the ND turned all over the people. He knows that the crime of Tempi has caused his anger, which has repeatedly expressed on the street, at very massive rallies, but even in the one and a half million signatures, despite the objections we have about them.
 </p>
<p>
  What worries her, much more than she wants to show, is that this wrath of the world accumulates and concerns almost all aspects of his life. One of all the issues that opens up daily on the people's and youth rights can become the drop that will make the glass overflow, with unpredictable consequences.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, in the issue of Tempi, it wants to achieve two conflicting goals: to conceal the crime, to rid its ministers and itself from political responsibilities and to calm the anger of both relatives and people. And the pie and the dog grass, that is, something that if she has hoped to succeed is only because of her domination in the urban political scene and, above all, because of the absence of a popular movement so massive, contemplative and relentless that she will force her to do back.
 </p>
<p>
  In the debate in the House, her superiority was obvious, not only because she dared and went on the counterattack, but also because "
  <em>
   Bullion
  </em>
  "Against her, who was written in the press, probably not even touched by SYRIZA, PASOK, New Left and Freedom Cruise were far from expressing the popular feeling of concealment. And how could they, after all, have to be held accountable for what they did or did not do when they were in government positions, preparing the road that led to the crime.
 </p>
<p>
  As for the KKE, he defended his proposal for the establishment of the Inquiry Committee, which was implemented, saying that he had no illusions because he knew his limits, but was validated because the effort was revealed, new elements came to light, but also fueled. The mobilizations of people and youth! If it weren't for the exams would the strike and rallies be less crowded on 28 February? Discourse distortion of reality, with goals that are not present…
 </p>
<p>
  However, pressure on the government on the part of the EU, following the intervention of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and the challenge of parliamentary immunity and the law on the responsibility of ministers, which has opened all the debate over whether European law overrides Article 86 of its Constitution. Also, after Karystianos' speeches in the European Parliament, it was decided to remain in operation by the competent EU committees to control the judicial procedure, which, however, is proceeding very quickly, for Greek data.
 </p>
<p>
  The question is where. Pressures by the EU do not have the ... pure intention of the administration of justice to a member state that is suffering in this area. But they are moves on the political-geopolitical chessboard, aiming for a member state that is increasingly bound to the chariot of the great transatlantic ally and suffers in the field of ... dedication to the Union.
 </p>
<p>
  In any case, the most substantial pressure that can be exerted on the government is by the people through their mobilizations. Because as Karystianos herself said at some point, the justification will be not to happen again. Whatever this means, we will fill in…

   The case of the deceased is not unique. On the contrary, it is the usual and describes the regularity of the people as a result of the chronic attack of the system in the popular right to equal, complete and free care. Prime Minister Mr. Mitsotakis is proud of upgrading the NHS by advertising the absorption of funds by the recovery fund for renovation of buildings, while Minister Georgiadis is photographed with the first patient to be operated on afternoon. In fact, Georgiadis argues that only 1% disagree with paid surgeries and the rest of the health and people have been waiting for it for decades!
  </p>
<p>
   This is not an attempt to convert white into black. The reality is reality and the people do not chew puppy. However, they are aware of the limits of the political submission of trade unions and reformist forces and have weighted the reaction of the "below". They know, of course, that they cannot have a popular acceptance of a series of measures that make it even more difficult for the labor terms of health care and force the people to put their hand in the pocket even deeper to find their health.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
     The people will pay a new hike for diagnostic tests per referral. One euro for laboratory and three for imaging, with the aim of repaying clawback. The clawback is essentially money that did not pay doctors and diagnostic centers for exams already performed by EOPYY coverage due to fiscal adjustments. Mitsotakis' successful surpluses at the discretion of the imperialists are robbing the care of the people.
    </p>
<p>
     The increases in medicines have already been preceded by paying in addition to the contribution even when the insured receives the cheapest generic (see pp. 957). This, according to the "small" government, unravels the pension of the elderly, who usually take more than one medicine. Especially in cases where the cheaper drug is not even selected, as shortcomings have been normal after the export prohibition has been lifted and pharmacies are supplied by drugs from the dropper warehouses. On the side of them, the payment of five euros for the vaccine for COVID19 in pharmacies is established.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, but certainly not finally as the same policy will continue as long as sufficient popular resistance is formed, the personal physician will be paid. The personal doctor is declared to be a barrier to patients' access to hospitals. Together with the patient's electronic folder, the government is trying to seal the NHS environment to upgrade its ability to restrict access and broaden charges. He stumbled upon both in the reluctance of doctors' participation due to low earnings and intensification. The electronic dossier is proceeding with EU funding and compulsory implementation in hospitals. The obstacle to the non -participation of private doctors due to low earnings is passed by paying the patient the patient. Most likely it is that the patient will not even be able to visit the personal doctor who will refuse to access the hospital. Barrier to the barrier ...
    </p>
<p>
     The continuity and intensity of policy that will ruin labor rights for health care and the right of the people to free and equal to all care is a given. What we should constantly concern to us is how to build resistance on the part of the popular forces in the direction of getting a barrier to this policy. Skopelos of sold union leaders and the political line of reformist forces, with the KKE, are recognized obstacles in the development of this direction. But given the general popular discontent, which can fuel significant resistance outbreaks.

   From its initial phase and throughout its journey to its present form, the EU has been and exists as a venture of Europe's imperialists. It is a coalition to serve and promote interests and aspirations before all its imperialist pillars. It is the incomparable contradictions between these imperialist forces that set boundaries in the "unity" of the project, which is anything but historical law. Brexit was a clear manifestation of these contradictions, which today occur between its two main pillars (France-Germany) and are transferred to their satellites, but are also fueled by US involvement in a number of countries and bourgeoisie in today's coalition. of "27".
  </li>
<li li="">
<li li="">
<li li="">
<li>
      All of the above are already reflected in the political systems of all EU countries, which are facing the depreciation of the labor-like masses and are shifting in reactionary direction, and with the emergence (even in government roles) of far-right forces. Forces fueled by the general attack on the proletariat and the peoples, by the escalation of politics that stifle freedoms and democratic rights, the policy of wars and preachs of nationalism, hatred and division of peoples. At the same time, in the imperialist countries (France, Germany, but also Italy), the emergence of these far -right forces is also an expression of dissatisfaction with the megalistic class that are squeezed by imperialist competitions and seeking answers by promoting the most aggressive nationalism.
     </li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The "great upheaval" in view of the June European elections and the criticality attributed to them by imperialists and bourgeois forces are actually referring to all the above issues. The sovereign forces seek to exploit the Europes as a tool, on the one hand to renovate it - overall in the consciences of the peoples - "idea" of the EU, and on dealing with problems in each country's political systems. It is very characteristic that all far -right forces are zealous in the election campaign and support the "idea" of the EU, without a trace of "isolation". They thus prove again their complete bowing both in the imperialist context and the needs of the bourgeoisie that each is mentioned.
 </p>
<ol start="6">
<li li="">
<li li="">
</li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
  That is why all parties in the system (from the far -right to the so -called center -left) bombard the people demanding to forget, ignore the suffering that has accumulated and accumulates from the country's integration into the EU/EMU, and to seek (with them or with them or other negotiations) in this future! That is why in the name of the "cooperation of the peoples" that the EU is representing, its country and its seas are transformed into a tomb and a prison of the uprooted pieces of peoples, to protect European borders from the oppressed. With the same invocation (of the "cooperation of the peoples"), the country is ordered in a war and hatred position with the peoples of the region to serve its Euro -Atlantic patrons!
 </p>
<ol start="8">
<li li="">
<li>
    Based on all of the above, it is also obvious than the sun that the big struggles, demands and interests of the working-bodies of Europe cannot "meet"-and much more justified-within the prison of the peoples that the people that the people European imperialists have formed and heard in the name of the EU! The class rights and the revolutionary perspective of the masses cannot be expressed in an instrument such as the European Parliament, which is not the conquest of the peoples, but an imperialist construction. In the complaint of this construction and the struggle against the EU lies the path of "meeting" the struggles, the internationalist solidarity, the development of the mass struggle of workers and peoples. This struggle forms the terms of revolutionary perspective to the extent that it is emancipated by the political context defined by the capitalist-imperialist system, to the extent that it refuses to be chased in this political context and opens its own paths.

   The obstacles for the students of the poor and popular layers are multiplying. The government is trying rapidly to unfold the agenda of the attack on schools. It is reported that the National Bachelor's Degree will be "inaugurated" by students who will study in the First High School in the following school year, who will have to face a high school examination of the Pan -Hellenic, with the issues of the Bank and the Bank of Themes in all three classes of the High School. Special gravity coefficient per class (larger in the 3rd and smaller in the 1st High School), while at the same time providing the number of admissions to higher education from the universities.
   <strong>
    With the law on private universities, the hard class framework continues to be implemented, in which the children of popular families will not only be thrown outside the universities but also by the General High Schools, promoting the government as an alternative to channeling to the Professional education and apprenticeship.

Next to the students who have given a massive and militant struggle for months so that the Pierrakakis law would not pass. Next to teachers who are terrified because they claim labor rights and crawl in trials for their trade union action. The struggle against the education of the few and the chosen is a matter of struggle for the whole people.

<p>
  The invasion of Police Forces at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at noon on Saturday 16/3 to evacuate the occupations that were held in sections and the arrest of 49 students is a serious example of the system's revanchism.
 </p>
<p>
  Using damage outside the "Library" in the former biological hangout (which has been evacuated for 2 years since it was evacuated, still ... a library), police forces stormed into the site of the time when action took place as part of the occupation of S. PHI. Geology, arresting mass students, who attributed accusations of disturbing common peace and apathy. Indeed, the arrested students were held in GADTH until Monday 18/3, telling them that "ahead of the 2 months holding the occupation, 2 days of booking are nothing." It is clear that the real reason for this repressive operation is no deterioration of a building or "illegal energy". They were only looking for one occasion, up to that of ... "nuclear rifle", or whatever they could be dug up, to justify the invasion and the brutal repression.
 </p>
<p>
  The timing of evacuation and arrests of arrests in the FAI is no accident. In a phase where the student movement is in retreat, the system has found the opportunity to take the "rematch", to hit whatever flaws and resistors have remained in the schools. It is not, after all, the first evacuation of the occupation that the student movement has seen in its two -month struggle against the most voted on Pierrakakis law. The evacuation of the occupation of Law in Komotini, the Law of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and the Rector, a few weeks ago showed government moods. Even at the University of Athens Student Homes (FEPA) they invaded, arresting 3 students and attributing them 3 categories. The system is afraid of the student youth that, for 2 months, is on the streets and is fighting. In particular, it does not tolerate students who, even after the law is passed, insist on getting on the way to overthrow him.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   He is called, on the other hand, to put them with his false friends. Under the responsibility of the main reformist forces (KNE-ARIS) who declared a cessation of the movement, but also by all others who see the struggle to overthrow the law as something "utopian", the students who have been motivated by persistence all the time, They were left untouched. On the one hand, they refer to "diverse actions beyond the occupation", which they seem to not even include ... the demonstration. Indeed, in the majority of clubs nationwide, these forces are now rallying the frames of "anti-occupation", while with the force (until not at all) supported solidarity mobilizations to the arrested students. On the other hand, Ara and a series of other forces come out with the flag of "to keep the law on paper". As if we did not see with the minimum introduction base what was happening with the laws that were "left on paper". At some point their system applies them!
  </p>
<p>
   So, in these rationales, the student movement must stack its legs and continue the fight for the overthrow of Pierrakakis. Continue with re -General Assemblies, which will make decisions to continue the struggle with new occupations and demonstrations. The student movement has shown that it can overturn even voted laws, and no power - component or reformist - can deny it!
  </p>
<p>
   And that is what will be the real response to terrorism and repression. This is what will be the real response to the non -existent accusations of the 49 arrests of the RA and the threats of disciplinary persecution and student deletions. The student movement can only be "protected" and respond to terrorism! With mass general assemblies that will make solidarity decisions to the detainees, they will demand their acquittal and make decisions continued until the victory!

<p>
  Ukraine's possible defeat will highlight the weaknesses of Western mechanisms. And this is something that exacerbates a sense of strategic impasse, especially for European imperialists.
 </p>
<p>
  The situation on the Ukrainian front is such that it no longer dictates scenarios for the evolving conflict, but for the next day. Having Moscow the initiative of movement, the agonizing question is not where it will stop, but where it wants to stop. The centers of the West estimate, and justified, that its goals are no longer limited to the border of the four provinces attached.
 </p>
<p>
  European (if) security has many versions and varied events. Recently, the timeliness has been monopolized by Macron's threats (lionism), which begin with the "bomb" statement that NATO forces should not be ruled out to Ukraine.
 </p>
<p>
  It didn't take much time since June 2022, when Macron stated: '
  <em>
   I am convinced that the role of France is that of a mediating force
  </em>
  "! Today, despite his ambiguities and old -fashioned, he constantly throws oil on the fire ... "
  <em>
   We are not in a straight conflict with Russia but we cannot let her win
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   We are not in war with Russia, but it is waging war against us
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero
  </em>
  »Etc. For Moscow, such a demonstration of power (albeit rhetoric) by the head of the French state, in addition to a type of bluff, can be considered a "trolley" of Western intentions.
 </p>
<p>
  However, Macron's anti -Russian bids may have other extensions. The bourgeoisie has seen its "credibility" decrease in recent years in a traditional sphere of influence: West Africa. Whether the eastern edge of Europe can be a compensatory field of action of French imperialism is very doubtful. However, more or less, Macron tells the countries of A. Europe that France does not have the suspensions of Germany and is willing (and capable?) To replace US guarantees at national or even European level! This intention was updated at the recent trilateral German, France and Poland summit in Berlin.
 </p>
<p>
  For his part, German Chancellor Saltz, after clarifying that countries supporting Ukraine are not in war with Russia, was sufficient in Brussels' declarations regarding Europe's help to Ukraine. Is the issue to what extent it controls its three -party government? In the extreme pro -Nursery and anti -Russian statements by Foreign Ministry Berbok (Greens), Germany's Minister of Education Vacinger (Liberals) were added, who, in an interview with the Funke Group newspapers, proposes the preparation of the students (in the context of the pupils). War ... it even imagines it as part of everyday life!
 </p>
<p>
  There are not many. Or the West will move towards a complete conflict with Russia or try to halt it by negotiations, mitigating any costs. If the second is true (which does not mean the immediate end of the war), the terms will basically be dictated by Moscow. It is obvious that both sides do not approach a ceasefire in Ukraine in the same way. It is not only that this should start with the acceptance of the new borders and the consolidation of any acquisitions, but they should also respond to their long -term strategic goals. In such a scenario it is estimated that the Russian delegation will reach the table with a sense of strategic advantage. For the Kremlin it is a key condition that the negotiations will not define a new "frozen conflict" or "a break for Ukraine re -equipment".
 </p>
<p>
  The Russian president (who was not particularly struggling for his re -election) does not seem to put the consultations on the forefront. In his public festive speech (on his election victory and the anniversary of Crimea's attachment), he reiterated warnings to the West for the use of nuclear in any "official" development of Western troops in Ukrainian territories. These Putin warnings are not made in the void. The background is long -term and the controversy exceeds the borders of Ukraine. It became clear by Russia that a possible West-Russia negotiation would not be limited to its "territorial" as its future neutrality and demilitarization. And may require safeguards concerning all A. Europe
 </p>
<p>
  In the estimation of Western analysts, it appears that the US would be enough for Russia to leave Ukraine without other territorial conquests. Putin's appeal is considered to be the dismissal of Nuland, number 3 to the State Department, with a field of responsibility in Ukraine for at least ten years. However, this action could also be considered an indirect assumption of Russia's achievements in Ukraine!
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   All of this reflect fears of the correlations that are going to be shaped, as developments, and the uncertain of their end in both the battlefields in Ukraine but also gauze as well as throughout the Middle East. There are uncertain parameters that form an unprecedented situation, raising more issues of re -evaluation of imperialist relations. A state of fine balances, reflecting the interests of the dominant imperialists both peripheral and the world stage as a whole.
  </p>
<p>
   A situation that, highlighting its multifaceted dynamics, may be the reason for the inevitable and violent adjustment of US strategies and priorities. A situation where "continued politics by other means" will tend to become a rule.

<br/>
  In our long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br/>
  history of class struggle for all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at the same time that
  <br/>
  despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the
  <br/>
  British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the
  <br/>
  success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to
  <br/>
  the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat
  <br/>
  Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we
  <br/>
  have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded
  <br/>
  with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly
  <br/>
  opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including
  <br/>
  Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack
  <br/>
  the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them
  <br/>
  and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.
  <br/>
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br/>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire
  <br/>
  economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
  <br/>
  native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br/>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their
  <br/>
  Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and
  <br/>
  displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to
  <br/>
  face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
  <br/>
  Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure
  <br/>
  was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more
  <br/>
  and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly
  <br/>
  implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to
  <br/>
  the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India,
  <br/>
  Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro-
  <br/>
  imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over
  <br/>
  the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country
  <br/>
  through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and
  <br/>
  communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today
  <br/>
  the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br/>
  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out
  <br/>
  from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has
  <br/>
  abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the
  <br/>
  resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
  <br/>
  India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the
  <br/>
  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green-
  <br/>
  Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous
  <br/>
  people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis
  <br/>
  ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive
  <br/>
  deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from
  <br/>
  the Adivasi region. People's resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are
  <br/>
  being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific
  <br/>
  news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until
  <br/>
  and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid
  <br/>
  on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
  <br/>
  developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the
  <br/>
  people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this
  <br/>
  enemy's machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and
  <br/>
  women's organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists
  <br/>
  to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
  <br/>
  seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideals of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in order to expose the
  <br/>
  treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

     In the 
  Very central via Indipendenza of Bologna, the police today loaded and 
  Pushed university students for days in mobilization.

<span>
     Yesterday 
  In Bologna, university students had protested in front of the 
 Academic Senate to ask for the end of the censorship against 
 those who mobilize against the war in Palestine, to demand the 
 boycott of agreements with Israel and the military sector 
 industrial.
    </span>
</span>

<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-170586 alignleft" height="300" src="https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2024/03/Bologna-universita-Palestina-striscione-300x300.jpg" srcset="https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2024/03/Bologna-universita-Palestina-striscione-300x300.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     The 
  Academic Senate refused to terminate the agreements in the field 
 military and war, expressing himself with yet another vaga formula e 
 smoky, substantially reiterating the need to respect the 
 regulations and the ethical code which, as regards the dual use, yes 
 I limit to "minimizing any damage" ...
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     We want 
  And we demand a concrete commitment of the University that goes to terminate 
  All agreements with the Leonardo group, with NATO and with the partners 
 of the Zionist government of Israel ”wrote the 
 Students to change the course of the Bolognese university.

   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     The 
  mobilizations in our country show that getting the boycott is 
  possible and we can do it only through the struggle, as happened yesterday 
 to the academic Senate of the University of Turin, where thanks to the 
 mobilization has been able to obtain non -participation 
 of the Torinese University to the new Maeci of cooperation tender between Italy and 
 Israel".

<span>
     But 
  Today Minister Bernini arrived in Bologna for the inauguration 
 of the academic year and the students mobilized to do 
 hear, also in light of the Minister's statements against
     <span>
<a href="https://contropiano.org/regionali/piemonte/2024/03/20/torino-luniversita-cancella-il-progetto-con-israele-0170577">
       Students and teachers of the University of Turin

<span>
     The 
  procession of the students who arrived in via Indipendenza tried to 
 reach the headquarters of the Manzoni Theater where the ceremony took place with 
  Minister Bernini, but found a deployment against him 
 of the police who soon went to the de facto roads by loading e 
 pushing the students. The procession reappeared the files and is 
 directed in a university area.

<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
      There 
  protest was also revealed within the theater where it was present 
 A group of students with the Palestine flag. Francesca 
 representative of the Student Council, intervened shortly before 
 of the intervention of the Minister of the University, Anna Maria Bernini, with 
 Kefiah around the neck. “For months we have been witnessing the systemic censorship of 
 voices from the Palestinian community and what are the 
 requests of student mobilizations ”denounced the 
 Student.

  NATO troops, together with their political staffs are on the territory of Yugoslavia, distributed in BiH, Croatia and Macedonia.
 </p>
<p>
  The NATO Pact created American imperialists in cooperation with the Imperialists of Western Europe in 1947. Concerned about the great victories of the Soviet Union, the creation of the Socialist Tabor, the victory of the Red Army in China and the most more powerful anti-Colonial and anti-primerial movements in the third world countries, as an aggressive military block against the Soviet Union, China and Liberation Movements in Colonies. From the very beginning of his creation he formed as a stroke military fist, which was supposed to won the Soviet Union and other socialist countries militarily and to restore capitalism in them. Direct NATO interventions in Vietnam, Latin America and Africa are known.
 </p>
<p>
  At the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact was disbanded, and the countries in the composition of the Soviet Union, as well as the countries of Eastern Europe, liquidated socialism and went through the restoration of capitalism.

<p>
  When the main opponent of the NATO Pact was disappeared - Warsaw Pact, it seemed to be normal to dissolve the NATO Pact. Instead, the NATO pact is even more reinforced, conveniently, the most perfect types of weapons and increased the military budgets of the NATO member. Using economically, diplomatic, political and military pressure makes everything to expand, not only to all countries of Eastern Europe, but also on all the countries of the former Soviet Union and thus reaches Russia's borders. It is the goal of being completely insulate that Russia, they put it on their knees and the countries of the former Soviet Union create a kind of semi-coloni, to use their huge natural resources unobstructed, to gain abundance of cheap labor and spacious market. It is obvious that the NATO pact remains an aggressive military force of imperialism and it seems everything in order to provide the rule of imperialism throughout the world, but only to economic and financial resources in the world's military force.
 </p>
<p>
  NATO Pact is the reactionary military force of American imperialism, the most dangerous enemy of the socialism and the people of the third world countries.
 </p>
<p>
  Why did NATO's troops come to Yugoslavia?
 </p>
<p>
  The United States and the NATO Pact, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the other only superpowers, the only global force in the world. One of the strategic goals of the United States and the NATO is not allowed to get out of the events in the world to escape their control and start developing their influence or against them. They still watched the war in Slovenia, Croatia for several years, and especially in BiH, they did not consider to intervene. However, they concluded that the continuation of the war in BiH would inevitably led to its expansion to Kosovo, Macedonia and the entire Balkans and to enter Turkey and Greece, two important NATO members against the other. The NATO Pact then decided to send troops and stop the war in BiH. They forced Milosevic and Tudjman to sign the Dayton Agreement.
 </p>
<p>
  One other element seriously influenced that the application of the Dayton Agreement, as well as the intention to resolve Kosovo and enable longer and more stable peace in the Balkans. The rush of the United States and NATO is caused by the possibility of "exploding" Turkey soon, and with it the entire East, they may be found in the war with the entire Muslim world that now counts about a billion and one hundred million people.
 </p>
<p>
  What is the attitude of the work party in connection with the presence of NATO in Yugoslavia?
 </p>
<p>
  Party of Labor considers that this should be considered without emotion and assess whether the presence of NATO is used in the NATO presence or harms the people of Yugoslavia. The team before there were cases in history when the interests of the imperialist, if it was a joint enemy, could coincide with the interests of the people. This happened in the Second World War when the Soviet Union concluded a pact with the two largest imperialistic forces of that time - the United States and English for the fight against the common enemy of Hitler's German.
 </p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, nationalism affects wide masses in Yugoslavia. Greater Serbian and Great Rhine Chauvinists, in fact, with their policy of the war and endangering the U.S. and NATO global interests and NATO's arrival in Yugoslavia. The fact is that in Yugoslavia, just because of these widespread nationalist consciousness, they could not organize forces that would oppose the disastrous, chauvinist politics of Milosevic and Tudjman. The fact is that they did not arrive NATO troops and the force of their weapons stopped war, would probably have been thousands of thousands of dead, new destruction and new crimes during the two years.
 </p>
<p>
  The act of stopping the war was positive. Efforts to apply the Dayton Agreement, ensure the unique BiH, return all refugees to their homes and that the penalties of war criminals, the PR is considered the interest in the people of Yugoslavia. Application of the Dayton Agreement and resolving Kosovo issues A missing blow to the Great Serbian conquerable war policy, and the nationalism in Yugoslavia, which was the main substrate of that policy. That is why the PR in this situation is not against the presence of NATO for now, because at this moment it is in the interest of the people of Yugoslavia.
 </p>
<p>
  But, if even after the establishment of peace in BiH and resolving these basic problems, NATO troops will be remained in Yugoslavia, the Party of the work will be considered for occupiers, which will really be. Then the PR as a true patriotic party will organize a political and other fight against NATO presence, all the way to the armed fight for the liberation of the Earth from the occupier.

<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">
     CUT Congress from February 26 to March 1, 2024
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   A few weeks ago the VIII Cong Congress was held in the city of Bogotá, prior to this, the Congress of Youth and that of CUT women was held.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    Meanwhile, the Cut Congress did give him a decision and by delegates, with the aggravating man who arrived the documents already made and machine to show a majority that approved them. They also invited the Minister of Labor and the Deputy Minister, despite being criticized by the base workers, because although they were unionists, they are now part of the State institutions that are at the service of the capitalists regardless of their intentions.
   </p>
<p>
    It is obvious that, if they do not allow them to speak to those who dare to criticize, union democracy is not being exercised, and a always majority approves the conclusions that are already machined from above. In this way, the new delegates, especially from other cities, believe that this is the way of working in the trade union movement, ignoring that union democracy is too much from being that, because the minority must be allowed to defend their positions.
   </p>
<p>
    That is why trade unionism, managed by bourgeois ideology does not serve the collective interests of the working class, so far it has only served to promote those bureaucrats in state positions, it has served for many leaders to turn the union into their Minor box, while the workers are orphaned and at the mercy of what the patterns want to do with them.
   </p>
<p>
    That is why from these pages we have been denouncing that bourgeois policy of conciliation and concertation of classes, which are precisely the foundations of the CUT.
   </p>
<p>
    In the political statement that presented as a final conclusion of the VIII Congress, it is claimed that the salary increase approved for this year was an achievement. Surely none of those bureaucrats earns a minimum wage, nor do they have The most brutal persecution for the bosses, most of the CUT bureaucracy no longer feels what it is to live with a pyrric minimum wage. That is, these bureaucracies do not represent the majority as they know, and do deceive and handle the workers preventing them from organizing with class independence and building their own organizations.
   </p>
<p>
    The political statement of the CUT is just one more speech, but what they defend there is pure demagogy; That bureaucracy has become a machinery that does not allow it to be changed from the inside, it is similar to a tiny state, impossible to change because the State since it was created has the function of guaranteeing the privileges of the classes that have economic power, And in the case of the CUT, from birth it was tied by the ideology and politics of the bourgeoisie, which made it the engendro that is today.
   </p>
<p>
    It is an immediate need for trade union organizations to cease to be behind a trade that can do the bureaucracies of union plants. The trade union movement must fight for their organization with independence of class and from the streets, with the complaint and protest to tear the vindications of the people to the bourgeoisie; But it is essential to act organized and centralized, under principles that represent its class, which returns to solidarity strikes.
   </p>
<p>
    But this must be worked as aware and with a lot of commitment, understanding that the claims are solved collectively, really organized in independent federations, that they are the foundations of a true independent central for its ideology and politics at the service of workers and not of employers , a central one that directs the struggle of workers in improving their conditions, but not to stay as salaried slaves, but to have the strength to fight against capitalism, against wage exploitation and the construction of a new society, socialism .
   </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
     Advance the restructuring of the trade union movement!

     Mayora Carmelina Yule Paví - March 20, 2024

<p class="has-text-align-right">
<em>
    The day I die, the day I am not in the territory, you do not stay there, do not be afraid to die. After they are fighting with their hands, with their cane, it is the greatest pride they can have, not like them, that they are cowards who hold a weapon and with that weapon they want to intimidate us, but no, do not let themselves bend, be they brave, talk
   </em>
   «, Said María Teresa about the legacy left by her mother Carmelina.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Since Saturday, March 16, several acts of violence against the NASA community have been presented in the rural area of the municipality of Toribío (Cauca), there was killed the indigenous leader Carmelina Yule Paví, 52, was injured when he accompanied Members of the Indigenous Guard to rescue a minor who had forced to be recruited by the Dagoberto Ramos Front of the Central General Staff (EMC) of the FARC dissidents. Subsequently, the Indigenous Community and Guard rescued 2 girls who had been kidnapped. During the funeral of Mayora Carmelina, they were again victims of armed harassment by the same armed group.

</p>
<p>
   The armed conflict generates massacres, forced recruitment, is favored by the lack of opportunities in education and work. The abandonment of the field by the State, leads rural communities to poverty; In particular, children and young people become cannon fodder, due to the war for the dispute of the gain of coca, poppy and marijuana crops.
  </p>
<p>
   This reactionary war, made by the different armed groups such as the paramilitaries, the armed forces of the State, the dissidents of the FARC, the ELN and common crime groups, has cost the lives of thousands of young people for decades and although in the new Government promotes the speech of "total peace", the war continues in the field, pointing to the extermination of the communities.
  </p>
<p>
   With this action, the decomposition of dissidents is demonstrated since they do not have a political base ennobled by socialism, which guides its cause against the enemies of the people; On the contrary, they have become a poster rather than massacra to their own people.
  </p>
<p>
   Hence, the requirement for the Government to meet its promises to generate sources of employment, to deliver land to the communities, provide the conditions for free and quality education for primary, secondary and university.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    The most urgent demands in this situation to Petro's government:
   </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    That the government protects the life of communities within the territories.
   </li>
<li>
    After the suspension of the bilateral and temporary ceasefire agreement in the departments of Cauca, Nariño and Valle del Cauca. Which means that the government resumes military actions against the dissent of the FARC, it is necessary that the indigenous guard be recognized as a government of territorial control of all regions with the legal and legislative legal, political, political rights.
   </li>
<li>
    Change illicit crops for lawful: that the production of coca and marijuana crops is legalized since they have become an industry where the profits are carried by local and foreign investors and it is the communities that put the dead.
   </li>
<li>
    That university academic training is promoted by building universities in the 10 departments of the South West.
   </li>
<li>
    That sources of employment are generated based on agricultural and technified mining production to take care of the environment, a situation that would avoid the migration of young people to the cities in search of employment and especially not to be part of the armed groups becoming perpetrators of His own communities.
   </li>
</ul>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   We reject Carmelina's murder.
   <br>
   No more kidnapping of young people, or forced recruitment.
   <br>
   Below the war against the people.
   <br>
   Neither the State, nor the politicians, only the people saves the people.

  Supreme Federal Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes ordered, on the afternoon of March 22, the pre-trial detention of the Army Lieutenant Colonel, Mauro Cid, after the leak of an audio in which Lieutenant Colonel launches criticisms Against the minister, the STF and the Federal Police (PF). The audios were published in full this morning by the magazine of the communication monopoly, see. In the afternoon, Mauro Cid was called to testify in the STF and was arrested for "breach of precautionary measure." The Supreme Court also threatens to cancel the award -winning plea agreement, but should maintain the validity of the evidence offered by ICD.
 </p>
<p>
  Cid's arrest warrant was served shortly after the award -winning report on March 22, which lasted 1h30. Cid was accused of “obstruction of justice” and “non -compliance with precautionary measures”.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  What the whistleblower's leaked audios say
 </h4>
<p>
  In the audios, Lieutenant Colonel accuses the PF to distort his words, take the phrases out of context and hide some contents of the statements intentionally. He states that the Supreme Court and PF has a “ready narrative” and just want to prove it at any cost, and were even coerced to say things I didn't know. “They are the law now. The law is over. Alexandre de Moraes is the law. He holds, he lets out, when he wants, as he wants. With prosecutor, without prosecution, with accusation, without accusation ”.
 </p>
<p>
  In another moment of leaked audio, Cid states that “Alexandre de Moraes already has his sentence ready, I think this is the great truth. He already has his sentence ready. It's just waiting for a while. The moment he finds convenient, denounces everyone, the PGR [Attorney General of the Republic] accepts, accepts and he holds everyone. ” Finally, Lieutenant Colonel also hosted Moraes hides episodes of 2022: “I talked about that meeting of Alexandre de Moraes with the president, they were disconcerted, disconcerted. I said, ‘Do you want me to say?’ ”
 </p>
<p>
  In the audio, Lieutenant Colonel also made a point of talking about how was what was most damaged because of the 2022 coup articulation, almost as the one that risked the “cause” most: “I fucked the most was me. Who lost something else was me. No one lost career, no one lost financial life as I lost. Everyone was already four stars, had already reached the top, right? The president had pix of millions, was a millionaire, right? ”He said.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Mauro Cid loses, Bolsonaro wins
 </h4>
<p>
  The leakage of the audios, in which the whistleblower claims to have been pressured by the investigators and that the questions were biased, objectively reinforced the position of the far right and Bolsonaro's rightist allies. These seek to “burn” STF Minister Alexandre de Moraes as “partial” to conduct the inquiry. Whether or not it is true what Mauro Cid said, the fact is that the suspicion is already planted. This does not mean that the evidence is legally annulled now, but politically, a possible arrest warrant is fragile in the short term.
 </p>
<p>
  It draws attention, however, that Mauro Cid has gained absolutely nothing with this leak. Lieutenant Colonel got sick and passed out as he received the prison voice. On the contrary, Bolsonaro wins. Allies and Bolsonaro's legal defense celebrated the event, even calling him “license plate”.
 </p>
<p>
  It is amazing how, among scammers and fascists, disloyalty and betrayal flourish like Bambus after the rains: Mauro Cid, the whistleblower, was betrayed by his interlocutor, who leaked the audio that seriously damaged him. Cid, however, cannot complain: had delivered information that incriminated Bolsonaro to get rid of the prison. These people surrender each other, regardless of whether they were old allies. Mauro Cid cheated on and was betrayed. As Shakespeare wrote, in
  <strong>

<p>
  According to information revealed by journalist Denise Assis, from Portal Brasil 247, the purpose of the former army commander, Júlio César Arruda, by positioning tanks in front of the pocket camp in the Army HQ on the night of January 8-thus preventing, thus, preventing, thus preventing The arrest of the "green chickens"-was to protect the daughter and wife of the former commander Eduardo Villas-Bôas. The decision was accepted by Luiz Inácio, who prevarious with Arruda.
 </p>
<p>
  It has been suspected for a long time that the camp in front of the HQ was used temporary for reactionary and family members who took part in the
  <em>
   bolster
  </em>
  From 8/1, and that the tanks served as protection for its departure before the entrance of the Military Police (PM) troops. At the time, the official justification that repercussions the most in the press was that the PM entrance was postponed to avoid a “blood bath” as there were armed “green chickens” in the camp that could react. However, this is not the real version of the facts.
 </p>
<p>
  The truth is that Army Commander Julio Cesar Arruda discovered the presence of Maria Aparecida and Ticiana Villas-Bôas in the camp and that they had participated in the invasion of the Praça dos Three Powers. The then army commander contacted Gustavo Henrique Dutra, Planalto's military commander, to set up the shielding of the armor at the entrance of the barracks and prevent the PM from entering. Dutra also received the task of talking to Luiz Inacio, informing him and convincing him to suspend the order. Dutra spoke first with General Gonçalves Dias, then Minister of GSI, and convinced him to pass to the agent. In the conversation, Dutra reported to Luiz Inácio the presence of Maria Aparecida and Ticiana, warned the president that there was a risk of upheaval if their arrest was made, since the figure of Villas-Bôas is unanimous in the barracks. Luiz Inácio, thus, accepted the order.
 </p>
<p>
  Maria Aparecida Villas-Bôas, wife of the former commander, was an extremely active figure in the articulations by the institutional rupture. She often visited camps, even hindering on one of the visits that Villas-Bôas was with her and went to one of the military summit to discuss the coup.
 </p>
<p>
  The facts revealed explain the degree of the military crisis in which the nation is still plunged. After all, if the simple arrest of family members of a former commander could untie a process of breaking hierarchy and discipline in the barracks, the only certainty we can have is that this same hierarchy and discipline are extremely fragile. And in fact, they are: the troops have not changed, nor the essentials of their command. Who can believe that Brazil is really safe from an institutional rupture, as the liberals and opportunists suggest?

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  At the time, the worker was imprisoned two months in a prison in the municipality of São Gonçalo and is currently in provisional release. Diego's colleagues and relatives require the end of the judgment against the motorcycle taxi driver and denouncing the criminalization of the black, poor and peripheral people promoted by the old state.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration began at noon and was attended by friends and family of Diego, as well as democratic organizations such as the Brazilian Center for Solidarity to Peoples (Cebraspo). At the time, the protesters raised posters and echoed phrases like
  <strong>
   Justice for Diego
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Mototaxi is not a bandit, stirred him messed with me
  </strong>
<strong>
   Worker is not a bandit, it was the PM who killed Amarildo
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  During the interventions, family members denounced the racist character of the police in the constant arbitrary arrests and operations against favela workers, pointing out that Diego's case is no exception, but a rule in a country where 44.5% of prisoners They have not yet been tried, according to data from the National Council of Justice (CNJ) in 2022.
 </p>
<p>
  Protesters also denounced the two weights and two measures used by the Old State Court. While suing, arresting, and criminalizing thousands of innocent workers, it acquit and free the military police who kill the people in the slums, as recently occurred with the acquittal of the police who murdered the worker Claudia Ferreira.
 </p>
<p>
  The judgment of Diego's case was postponed to April 1 at 2 pm due to the non -attendance of police officers who are part of the prosecution. The family invites everyone to participate in another act that will take place on this day at 12 noon in front of the Court.

   NOVA DEMOCRACIA REPORTS
  </a>
  that on Tuesday, March 19, the trial of the request for acquittal of the 23 political activists persecuted for their participation in the 2013 and 2014 demonstrations took place at the Court in Rio de Janeiro.
 </p>
<p>
  The trial lasted around 20 minutes and unanimously approved the acquittal of the activists. Outside the court, popular class movements, democratic entities and associations gathered to denounce the political persecution and demand the acquittal of the 23 activists persecuted by the old State for 10 years.
 </p>
<p>
  At the event, in addition to celebrating the result of the trial, speeches were also made against the criminalization of the popular struggle currently underway, defending the people’s right to struggle for their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The case against the 23 began in 2014, with accusations of “gang formation” and “corruption of minors”. The activists were sentenced to sentences ranging from 5 to 7 years in prison. The accusations and arrests linked to this process are part of the campaign of persecution and criminalization of the popular struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  It is worth highlighting that the criminalization of activists and young people who took to the streets to protest also included the participation of the press monopoly, which painted the young fighters as “terrorists” and “vandals”.
 </p>
<p>
  Igor Mendes, among others was imprisoned. He served almost 7 months. Several other people had to remain underground to escape the waves of arrests that were taking place.
 </p>
<p>
  During these 10 years of struggling against the absurd process, the people’s lawyers managed to completely prove the complete farce behind the accusations, which was not supported by evidence but by “testimonies” from undercover agents and other illegalities. that made up a process full of gross flaws.
 </p>
<p>
  The acquittal represents a political victory not only for the activists directly affected but also for all those who struggle, especially the youth, who dared to stand up in the heroic days of 2013 and 2014 against oppression and exploitation of the people. The outcome is also important due to the given current national situation, marked by a profound reactionarization of the State, which has been creating new laws and legal mechanisms to criminalize popular struggle and the right to demonstrate.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/><br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/><br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/><br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.

(a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7.

After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations.

The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

(a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4.

In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part. Article 89   Surrender of persons to the Court 1. The Court may transmit a request for the arrest and surrender of a person, together with the material  supporting the request outlined in article 91, to any State on the territory of which that person may be  found and shall request the cooperation of that State in the arrest and surrender of such a person. States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2.

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2.

Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2.

Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  On Thursday, last week, a dispute on land between people from Okuama, Ughelli South, and Okoloba, Bomadi, in Nigeria’s southern state of Delta, took place. The armed forces of the old State tried to intervene but received what they did not expect.

  The soldiers were responding to a call during fighting between some people connected to two rival factions of the feudal landownership. According to local media reports, there have been clashes repeatedly over land ownership in recent weeks, leaving several people dead. One man was abducted during that fighting, with the Nigerian military unable to get the man released.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not unusual that soldiers are sent to resolve conflicts in countryside, which often erupt over land or compensation for oil spills by energy companies in many Delta state communities.
 </p>
<p>
  But this time things went somehow different than usual. It is
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/top-stories/nigeria-16-soldiers-killed-in-delta-state-community-clashes/ar-BB1k5gJ4">
   reported
  </a>
  that when the soldiers from the 181 Amphibious Battalion, responded to a distress call and appeared at the scene, they were surrounded by the local youth and killed at the spot. Among the dead were a commanding officer, two majors, one captain and 12 soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  An investigation has been opened and “a few arrests have been made while steps [are] in place to unravel the motive behind the attack,” Defense Headquarters spokesman Brigadier General Tukur Gusau said in a statement.
 </p>
<p>
  It
  <a href="https://www.herald.ng/residents-flee-as-military-recovers-15-soldiers-bodies-in-delta/">
   has been reported
  </a>
  , that the masses have now fled the area when the army was sent in to recover the mutilated corpses and to take revenge – houses were set ablaze.
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   This incident shows once more the hatred the masses feel towards the ruling big-landlord-bureaucratic system and their repressive forces and on the other hand the impotence of these to prevail the old order, as an expression of the deep crisis imperialism is sinking in.

A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received.

The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.

The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2.

In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5.

The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1.

No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2.

Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/><br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/><br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations.

The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

(a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4.

If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.  Article 91   Contents of request for arrest and surrender 1. A request for arrest and surrender shall be made in writing.

In the case of a request for the arrest and surrender of a person already convicted, the request shall contain  or be supported by:  (a) A copy of any warrant of arrest for that person;  (b) A copy of the judgement of conviction;  (c) Information to demonstrate that the person sought is the one referred to in the judgement of  conviction; and  (d) If the person sought has been sentenced, a copy of the sentence imposed and, in the case of a  sentence for imprisonment, a statement of any time already served and the time remaining to be  served. 4. Upon the request of the Court, a State Party shall consult with the Court, either generally or with respect to  a specific matter, regarding any requirements under its national law that may apply under paragraph 2 (c).  During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.<br/><br/>45 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 92   Provisional arrest 1. In urgent cases, the Court may request the provisional arrest of the person sought, pending presentation of  the request for surrender and the documents supporting the request as specified in article 91.  2.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.  (b) Where, however, the request from the Court concerns information, property or persons which are  subject to the control of a third State or an international organization by virtue of an international  agreement, the requested States shall so inform the Court and the Court shall direct its request to the  third State or international organization.  10.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  We have previously
  <a href="https://www.redherald.org/2023/04/28/sudan-a-war-torn-country">
   reported
  </a>
  on the war in Sudan portraying an initial analysis of the circumstances of the outbreak of the war.
 </p>
<p>
  Nearly one year afterwards the situation is sharpening. It is
  <a href="https://monde-diplomatique.de/artikel/!5987031">
   reported
  </a>
  , that the war-actions dramatically increased, due to massive arming of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) by the United Arab Emirates on the one hand and the “government’s” Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) by Egypt. It is
  <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/03/sudans-forgotten-war-new-diplomatic-push-needed">
   said
  </a>
  , that around eight million people are displaced inside the country as well as being forced to fled into neighboring countries additional to around 3 million refugees resulting from previous conflicts. Half the territory is controlled by either the RSF or the SAF. The government fled the capital Khartoum to Port Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  Negotiation attempts failed or resulted in non-lasting cease-fires. Since these failures international organization focus on the supply with humanitarian aid.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the battle is for centered around El Fasher, the capital of the region North Darfur, after the RSF was able to conquer Nyala, al-Dshunaina and Zalingei three of five regional capitals in Darfur region. In El Fasher around 1.5 million people live, one third being internal refugees. The outcomes of the battle on El Fasher seems to become a turning point in the ongoing war.
 </p>
<p>
  While the burden lies on the masses of the peoples in Sudan, foreigners are profiting. In this aspects one can consider Egypt as the Yankees handyman, while the UAE seems to be a Russian proxy in Sudan, as most

   analysts
  </a>
  do.
 </p>
<p>
  In this sense the development of “DP World” is noteworthy. It was founded 25 years ago by the UAE state monopoly “Dubai World” as a maritime transport company. DP World started in 2016 to construct and run ports in Eastern Africa. First in Somaliland and Puntland, then in Senegal, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In October 2023 DP World took over the port of Daressalam in Tanzania for 250 million US-Dollar.
 </p>
<p>
  The UAE via its DP World was heading for the same port as the Russians – Port Sudan. So the UAE and the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group made up a joint-venture. Wagner transported arms paid for by the UAE with its troops in the Central African Republic to the RSF in Sudan. Since the Prigozhin incident and the restructuring of Wagner – we
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/26/two-years-of-russian-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine/">
   reported
  </a>
  – things became even more complicated. According to Le Mode Diplomatique today two different Russian groups are involved in arming the RSF. But the Kremlin is striving to overcome these issues by its new Africa Corps.
 </p>
<p>
  Due to the difficult situation with Wagner the UAE brought Libyan Chalifa Haftar in to play. Haftar organized air cargo from Bengasi to North-Western-Darfur. Additionally air-drops of weapons with parachutes were delivered.

  relations with the UAE were at an all-time high during his first visit to the Middle East since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Putin praised cooperation between the two countries as he met President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi in early December 2023, describing the UAE as “Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.” For the UAE, the strong ties with Russia is a “calculated risk” it is willing to take, a top UAE official

  On the other side the SAF are supplied via the sea to their residence in Port Sudan by Egypt. Egypt also directly intervened in the conflict, bombarding a Nile-River-Bridge in Khartoum in August 2023. Hundreds of Egyptian soldiers have been captured by the RSF and bombings of RSF positions by Egyptian fighter jets are reported,
  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/egypt-sudan-military-invasion/">
   according to the Atlantic Council
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In this situation the scenario tends towards a complete collapse of central government, what will boost the current explosive situation at the Horn of Africa even more. On the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, the UN Security Council, aware of this situation, adopted a UK-drafted resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan during the month of Ramadan, a sustainable resolution to the conflict through dialogue, compliance with international humanitarian law and unhindered humanitarian access.
 </p>
<p>
  The UN Secretary-General, the UN Security Council, the African Union, and the League of Arab States joined forces to call for this Ramadan truce but Ramadan has started with further fierce fighting. Ali Karti, the Secretary-General of Sudan’s Islamic Movement has now announced that a truce with the RSF will never be accepted.
 </p>
<p>
  On top of the death and misery the war itself causes Sudan is on track to becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis, with around 18 million people already facing acute food insecurity, according to a
  <a href="https://sudantribune.com/article283302/">
   report
  </a>
  by the United Nations. 220,000 severely malnourished children could reportedly die in the upcoming months if they do not receive urgent assistance. A total of some 3.7 million children suffer from malnutrition in Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  The perspective is quite horrible. The UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan is only 4 per cent funded. Both RSF and SAF used hunger as a weapon of war. The RSF has looted humanitarian warehouses and besieged cities. The SAF-controlled Humanitarian Aid Commission has systematically banned movement of lifesaving aid to RSF-controlled areas.
 </p>
<p>
  The recent fighting is very likely to damage the spring harvest, which will increase the hunger even more. Also adequate medical treatment is seldom since prices of medics sky-rocketed by 600 per cent.
 </p>
<p>
  The armed conflict in Sudan, driven forward by the Imperialist puppeteers, will continue to great even more disorder in a region tarnished by war.

A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received.

If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.

In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5.

States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber.

The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1.

No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2.

Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/><br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.

(a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means.

The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations.

The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

(a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4.

In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.  Article 91   Contents of request for arrest and surrender 1. A request for arrest and surrender shall be made in writing.

In the case of a request for the arrest and surrender of a person already convicted, the request shall contain  or be supported by:  (a) A copy of any warrant of arrest for that person;  (b) A copy of the judgement of conviction;  (c) Information to demonstrate that the person sought is the one referred to in the judgement of  conviction; and  (d) If the person sought has been sentenced, a copy of the sentence imposed and, in the case of a  sentence for imprisonment, a statement of any time already served and the time remaining to be  served. 4.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

           Now we should be registered for short -time work, which means that we are now getting ten percent less wages. The news stood everywhere that we would supposedly do this on a voluntary basis, but now we have to sign a company agreement. The news also stood that there are no dismissals. Nevertheless, 100 colleagues who were in temporary work had to go. In total, we are 1,000 colleagues who now get ten percent less wages. Our rent, purchasing and insurance are not 10 percent cheaper!

   It was a successful, militant and mass demonstration. Which has shown that the answer to the issue of persecution can and should take cinematic and central characteristics. After all, the government and the system are escalating their attack, with the new Criminal Code, the opening of the debate on the defrost of the Chrysochoid law on demonstrations, with the stroke of squatters and new persecution of trade unionists and militants.

  The race continues. After all, at the end of the demonstration was the appointment with the new trade union meeting &amp; amp; Motion-Collectives-Neighborhood Movements (Tuesday 26/3 at 18:30 in the 3rd GEL Piraeus- Mavromichali 14-) that will decide the new steps to take.

  On Thursday, 21/3, a gathering of a complaint by the prosecution of the prosecution of teachers for their political and trade union action in Piraeus and other cities of all 49 students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki took place in the center of Heraklion on Thursday 21/3.
 </p>
<p>
  As a racing moves of teachers, we proposed to the interventions in Primary and Secondary Education to invite the same day to Heraklion on this issue. We even suggested that we meet on Friday 15/3 to organize this concentration as best possible. This meeting was not made for various reasons. ELME not only did not participate but not even a resolution. The arguments of the SYNEK, the PEK and PAME were not only unacceptable but also ridiculous.
 </p>
<p>
  Eventually without particular fermentation and substantial intervention in schools, the gathering was made. Banners were involved in the racing movements of teachers, the left intervention, the left -wing concentration and the class course. Dozens of teachers and workers also responded. It was set up microphone, hundreds of notices were shared and there was a very good climate in the world's response. But in the end we couldn't make a demonstration.
 </p>
<p>
  We believe that our weaknesses and the possibilities that have been quite well in this mobilization must be concerned with all the forces we participated in. If we move more decisively in the next period for the serious issue of persecution (and not only) the result will be much better.
 </p>

 This day is established by the "EU" UN as World Day of Happiness. Indeed, so much concern about the essential bliss of mankind is not based. We will bend over the overweight. Is the excess of the agony of the good samaritas that we will put it? Rather, let's take the lead of the leader (at least in the Balkan south) Mitsotakis, to raise the country from 64th (out of 143 in total) of the international rankings, a little higher.
 <br>
<br>
 Of course, no matter how hard the blessed one (because some are grateful for him), unlikely to approach Israeli's jealous (estimates of the genocide) !! But his effort is rewarded, inquisitively ending.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Thus, the bullshit bullshit crushes in the wood and capture students in order to permanently lock the last success of establishing private high schools. As a consequence of which the people will be paid very much in the sea of "happiness" for the studies of their children (which they will not be able to) very much tuition in public universities.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Equally "surrounded" and at all, young people will make their way of life "leisure" with privatized and modernized trains. They will offer militant males their blood in a vortex of "rejoicing" to any war fronts the national prestige and nationalist task of embraced (submissive) with the imperialist American macabre designs. Just as the ancestors did "glorious" in Crimea, Sangari and Korea.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In a "blessing" parasite they will also conquer the heavenly eternity by saying goodbye to the futile world of matter (which the Christian bastard of society enjoys in mythical dosages) in the fire of the eye (achievement not directly of the current government) downpour. Companion will of course have the immortal (by religion) soul of the "careless" killed workers in employer hell. Where, with unstoppable "excitement", the Pentecostal Biologist is exhausted for the productive development of the place by fighting the daily battle with the non -capitalist and rather extraterrestrial monster of precision.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It is sufficient to not be seduced by demagogic, mischievous sirens, the Director of the oligarchy, painfully obtaining the popular "euphoria". Which stems from the deprivation of galloping policy of the welfare state of the welfare. With a "horrible" consequence instead of the "delicious" appeal to afternoon surgeries, the people will be forced to search for ... free treatment in hospitals and always at the expense of sacred resource savings. That is to say, the sacrifices for the purchase of defenders (which defense without introversion defense is spreading to the Red Sea) of the "pacifist" of death and a sense of security ... Syrian or Iraqi. Such, even granite confidence, utterly steadfast by the "jokes" of the threatening Putin Holocaust.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The "fascinating climate of ecstasy and care" of the people is enriched and completed with the hedonistic discourse of twelve -year -old girls, mixed with "gratitude" to their stapler. Who, with the bullshit of the impunity of the (bourgeois) law, issues them "altruistic" to the perverts, to win the needy girls "pleasantly" for living.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It is not enough that the Earth's ubiquitous sovereignty of capital and imperialists becomes a genuine nightmare the survival of the workers' masses, rather than we are at the same time unstoppable. They establish days of celebration and baptize each of the 365 witnessing days of the year under imaginative names. In a globe of hunger, pain, horror and clamor.
 <br/>
<br/>
 You hear happiness there. Where and by what criteria do the natural and moral perpetrators of the greatest crimes of the universe count it? In Gaza and Ukraine crematoriums or nearly nine million dead on the planet on the planet of acute starvation? Is it with hundreds of refugees at the bottom of Pylos or the 35,000 memories of the pandemic -only pandemic in Greece?
 <br/>
<br/>
 The peoples a single resurrected celebration should plan every day and moment. That of resistance to the barbarism and hypocrisy of the system. It is impossible to celebrate at the same time all together, bosses and slaves. Or the tyrants will feast on the unmistakable (officially) paradise, causing the masses of suffocating, despair, brutal repression and warlike masses or the peoples will breathe free, serene, creative, hopeful.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The pleasure of the few footpaths ruthlessly to satisfy the majority interests. While the happiness of many presupposes the defeat and crash of the class opponents of a handful of exploiters. Nothing in between is meant.
 <br/>

 The Minister of Education of Germany says schools must prepare students for the possibility of war, at the same time that the local bourgeois political system is dancing to the rhythm of June. European Council President Charles Michelle proclaims that "if he wants peace, Europe needs to be prepared for war" and that we need to "go into war economy" while at the same time, the long -haired delusions and lies for lies for lies. The "Europe of the Peoples" are re -employed by the rulers to drag their peoples to the upcoming electoral farce. So here, domestic starry is getting ready to wear the "democratic" of the costumes, at the same time as plans to dress the world of work and youth in variations whenever required.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  The parties concerned have agreed to continue the four-party Socialist Front of Nepal.
 </p>
<p>
  Top leaders of the CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand and the CPN (Maoist Centre), all participants in the Socialist Front of Nepal, held a meeting at the Prime Minister’s Residence, Baluwatar, on Friday morning. Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma, spokesperson for the Chand-led CPN, said that it had been agreed to continue the Socialist Front and advance the front’s programs.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same meeting, it was decided to try to get the CPN-UML to participate in the Socialist Front of Nepal. “From the beginning, our party was in favor of including other parties including the UML in the Socialist Front. However, due to the previous power coalition, UML was not accepting that,” Bishwakarma said. “Now, the environment has become easier after the change of power. Since they are also in the government, there has been a discussion about getting them to participate in the Front.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the changed situation, the parties have become hopeful that UML will participate in the Front. For this, a team including Chand, who is also the coordinator of the Socialist Front, held a two-hour conversation with UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli on Thursday. Bishwakarma said that Oli appeared positive. “He is positive. However, it is necessary to discuss some issues further,” he said.
 </p>
<p>
  “In today’s meeting, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav have been given the responsibility to further communicate with Oli,” Bishwakarma said.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  As we have already denounced (*), the Egyptian regime of Al Sisi is making a fence in the Sinai desert to lock the Palestinians on the run from Gaza, and thus facilitate the "ethnic cleaning" by Israel, in exchange for funding of the Ill.
 </p>
<p>
  The Egyptian regime is dominated by the military, who are also among the major capitalists of the country. "Pharaonic" affected business, such as the construction of the new capital (with enormous profits for themselves and for friends), have also magnified the debt of the state and now the only payment of interest on the debt weighs for over 10% of the GDP. Solution: print money, then create inflation, that is, cut the purchasing power of wages to maintain the profits of the owners, private, state and military.
  <br>
  In September 2023 the inflation had reached 40%, that is, the purchasing power of the already miserable wages and salaries had undergone a 40%cut.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Fearing the discontent for hunger wages also among public employees, the government has decreed the increase in the minimum wage from 4,000 to 6,000 Egyptian pounds (at the current gearbox, today 120 euros per month). For private employees, however, the minimum wage was brought to only 3,500.
  <br>
  In January, to workers who protested for the low wages, at Sisi he had the shamelessness of responding: “We don't eat? Let's eat. We don't drink? We drink, and everything works [and here he had made an obscene, sprinkling, comparison with the condition of the Palestinians deliberately hungry and thirsty by the Zionist state - ed.]. Are things expensive and some are not available? So?".
 </br></p>
<p>
<b>
   The response of the workers of the largest Egyptian factory, Misr di Mahalla al-Kubra's textile complex in the Nile delta, which has more than a century of history and struggles, arrived on February 22.
  </b>
<b>
   Discaning the protest slogans went on strike in 3,700.
  </b>
  Despite the intervention of the guards to prevent them from accessing the Central Piazzale, and the descenda in the field of the official union against the strike, the strike, supported by an independent union, has extended to at least 7 thousand workers.
  <br>
  The response of the masters and the government was: stick and carrot. Minimum salary at 6,000 le (a 70%increase), arrest of 13 "leader" of the strike (source: Labourstart), of which two still held on March 13, are also threatened with dismissal due to unjustified absence.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Evidently masters and government count on the continuation of inflation (still at 31% in January 2024), which will remain the increases, and the arrests are a warning to anyone, in Mahalla or elsewhere, came to mind to return to the struggle.
  <br/>
  But letting the strike continues without concessions seemed too dangerous to the government: he would have risked a generalized explosion because he knows that the strong increase in the cost of living has increased the pressure between the workers.
  <br/>
  An explosion that could connect to popular support to the Palestinian cause that is in Egypt, although the military regime does everything that may not to show it, and to the more general discontent for the heavy working and life conditions of millions of proletarians.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same days, in fact, hundreds of workers of a large construction company owned by billionaire Talaat Moustafa, in partnership with the Saudi Bin Laden family, also took to the fight.
 </p>
 They protested against the dismissal of permanent workers (especially those who have undergone accidents at work or have fallen sick) to hire workers with precarious contracts, and asking for the payment of arrears, a wage increase for caravan, safety measures and devices protection on construction sites, greater health coverage.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  In this case, it is significant that the company guards, who had intervened a week earlier to suppress an employee protest, a few days later also refused to enter service, complaining that they were paid LE 3000 (60 euros) per month for 14 hours of work per day, and obtained a raise.
 </p>
<p>
  The Talaat Moustafa group, which has become a giant with orders for the new capital, is now participating in companies with the ADQ of the Emirates group in a 35 billion dollar project for the construction of a tourist city on the Mediterranean coast, on land privatized by military.
 </p>
<p>
  These episodes of workers are indicative of a social temperature that is going up to Egypt as in other countries of the Middle East and which could lead to new explosions if the economic crisis will worsen, in connection also with the anger caused by the genocidal war of Israel against The population of Gaza.
  <br/>
  It is no coincidence that the IMF offers Al-Sisi billions in exchange for work dirty with collaboration with Israel; While on their part Meloni and Von del Leyen promise 7.4 billion euros to Egypt because he does the equally dirty work of retaining emigrants to Europe, as well as for other lucrative business.
 </p>
<p>
  We allow ourselves to repeat it: the only true friends of the Palestinians attacked and oppressed by Israel to Gaza and in West Bank are the workers and the exploited of the region and the world, not the Arab capitalist governments who exploit and repress their workers and are ready to do Business by collaborating with the imperialist metropolis in the repression of Palestinians and migrants.

   Thousands of workers strike for the increase in wages in the Ghazl al-Mahalla factory
  </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  - Di Beesan Kassab, 25 Febbraio 2024
 </p>
<p>
  Ghazl Al-Mahalla's workers are on strike to obtain higher wages and more equipped bonuses.
 </p>
<p>
  About 7,000 workers met on Saturday morning in the central square of the Ghazl al-Mahalla industrial complex for a strike that has already lasted for three days.
 </p>
<p>
  They ask that their daily meal is increased to 30 the [= 0.57 euros], raising a choir in which the amount is said to barely cover "the price of a liter of milk".
 </p>
<p>
  They also ask for the application of higher wages, referring to a recent wage increase for the public sector based on instructions by President Abdel Fattoh Al-Sisi, in the midst of an inflationary wave that has raised the cost of living at national level . In other slogans, workers asked: "Where is Sisi's decision?".
 </p>
<p>
  The mega-phabbrica of public property uses tens of thousands of people in the sectors of spinning, textile and medical cotton, as well as a power plant on a huge area of land in Mahalla al-Kubra, in the Governorate of Gharbiya.
 </p>
<p>
  Until Sunday, the negotiations of workers with the parent company have failed, said the center for unions and services to workers in a release released on Saturday evening. The meeting was attended by a representative of the Presidency, of the Labor Office, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the President of the General Union of Filaure and Weaving.
 </p>
<p>
  Several men who work in the company were held on Saturday by the National Security Agency after being summoned to be interrogated by the safety body together with some workers, said Ctws, without specifying the number of prisoners.
 </p>
<p>
  The workers launched the strike on Thursday [February 22], they told Mada Masr, starting in the prevalence of female clothing factories, which historically were at the forefront of several famous strikes of the company.
 </p>
<p>
  Hanan*, supervisor of a clothing factory, told Mada Masr that the workers of his building began to mark slogans, finally interrupting the work while the songs spread from one factory to another.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the security staff sealed the exits to prevent women from pouring into the central square of the complex, known as Piazza Talaat Harb. This safety measure was also applied to the power plant, according to Abdullah* who works there.
 </p>
<p>
  The security staff unlocked the gates of the factory around 15.00 on Thursday, half an hour before the end of the morning round, to make sure the workers left the premises and did not meet inside, said Hanan.
 </p>
<p>
  The company's workers described the low wages as a cause of dissatisfaction.
 </p>
<p>
  The cost of living has increased throughout the country, with an inflation that will exceed 30% in 2024. A recent "presidential package", which will be launched starting from March, provides for an increase in the minimum wage for the 4,000 public sector At 6,000 per month, with increases ranging from 1,000 to 1,200 per various job categories.
 </p>
<p>
  Although it is owned by the state, the Misr Spinning and Weiving Company, which owns Ghazl al-Mahalla, does not fall within the context of the presidential package, told Mada Masr a source of the Ministry of Finance.
 </p>
<p>
  The wages of the company are instead guided by the decisions of the National Council for Salari, which last October raised the minimum wage of the private sector to 3,500 le.
 </p>
<p>
  But the increase in October did not serve to contrast the reduction of purchasing power caused by inflation. After more than 25 years of service, Abdel Aziz* told Mada Masr that his total gain does not exceed 4,000 a month. The figure is equivalent to about $ 130 at the official exchange rate, or about 80 dollars at the rate of the market parallel to the time we write.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdullah said his salary is 4,200 LEE after 33 years of working with the company. Hanan, who is nearing retirement, receives a salary of about 6,200 LE.
 </p>
<p>
  Several sources of work of the company said that days before the strike, Gharbiya governor had made a series of visits to inspect a convoy that provides subsidized assets to the company's workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdel Aziz added that during Wednesday's visit, the Governor inspected a medical convoy that supplies the workers and "a worker told the Governor that his salary does not exceed 3500 le".
 </p>
<p>
  According to a declaration of the Ctws published on Saturday, the workers now ask that the minimum salary is brought to 6,000 le, with wage increases based on the seniority of service and a reduction of tax appropriations.
 </p>
<p>
  They also ask that their daily allowance for meals increased to 30 le, for a total of 900 per month instead of the current 210 per month, with a song circulating during the strike in which it was stated that the amount covers a barely "the price of a liter of milk".
 </p>
<p>
  The Ctws declaration of Saturday [February 24] stressed that the members of the company's official trade union committee, affiliated to the Egyptian union federation aligned to the state, tried to dissuade workers from the strike and to intimidate them, but were expelled from the square .
 </p>
<p>
  A prominent figure of the company's official trade union committee declared on Thursday in Mada Masr, on condition of anonymity, that the committee "prefers negotiation to the strike, but supports workers' requests".
 </p>
<p>
  Ghazl Al-Mahalla acted as a catalyst in late 2006 for a rebirth of the union action at national level, when a strike of tens of thousands of workers in the factory reverberated in a movement of similar strikes in other factories in the country.

  In a worrying development, the national security of Gharbia, in Egypt, would have retained at least five employees of the renowned textile company Ghazl El-Mahalla, despite the workers' decision to disperse their strike on February 29, 2024.
  <br/>
  The employees started the strike to request the application of the minimum wage.
 </p>
<p>
  Among the prisoners are Wael Abu Zuwayed and Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, currently held at the national security office for so much. They are added to three other workers, Sabah Ali Al-Qattan, Muhammad Al-Attar and Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, also detained.
 </p>
<p>
  Wael Abu Zuwayed was brought to the Cairo State Security Prosecutor's Office, where it was decided to retain it in pre -trial detention for 15 days. He is accused of having joined a group formed in violation of the law and of having released false information.
 </p>
<p>
  With a controversial move, on March 4, the direction of Ghazl El Mahalla issued notices of dismissal for the workers detained, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed and Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. The company claims that their absence from work lasted ten days, appropriately ignoring that it took place following their detention by national security.
 </p>
<p>
  The Justice Committee (CFJ) has condemned the prisoners, stating that the strike is a "spontaneous" reaction to the economic difficulties of Egypt and the confusion of financial policy. The CFJ underlines the need for a constructive dialogue and realistic solutions to deal with the legitimate requests of workers, instead of resorting to repression and intimidation. [...]

   The new actions of workers offer a hope of change in Egypt

</p>
<p>
  In addition to suffering the pressures of the masses for the vile response of the Egyptian regime to the ruthless attacks by the Israeli state in Gaza, the president "strong man" Sisi has to face the growing anger of the workers. The dizzying increase in food prices hardly affected Egyptian low -salary workers, but there are signs of a resumption of struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  About 14,000 textile workers in the largest Egyptian factory, the Misr Spin-think and weiving Company, in Mahalla Al-Kubra, in the region of the Nile delta, started a week of strike on February 22. The workers of one of the major branches of the real estate company Talaat Moustafa Group, Alexan-Dria Construction, in Cairo, protested on February 28th.
 </p>
<p>
  It was the workers of the Mahalla clothing factory that started to mark the slogans that quickly spread from one building to another. The safety personnel blocked the exits to prevent these workers, as well as those of the on -site power plant, gathered in the central square. However, on the third day, 7,000 strikers gathered there. Dozens of people have been arrested. As usual, the official trade union committee managed by the state denounced the strike, but the workers kicked them off the event.
 </p>
<p>
  This event echoes the historic strike of 2006, when Mahalla's women began the strike that was a fundamental step towards the 2011 revolt that ended the 31 years of government of President Hosni Mubarak. In 2008, the city witnessed a revolt that would have repeated himself on a national scale three years later.
 </p>
<p>
  [...] The strike ended after a week, following the intervention of the Minister of the Public Sector. The management agreed to pay a minimum of 6,000 per month and most of the arrested workers were released. A previous offer, which included the payment of extraordinary, participation in profits and health insurance, was not accepted.
 </p>
<p>
  Protest of construction workers
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of workers from Talaat Moustafa protested in front of the company headquarters. The company has fired workers with permanent contracts and replaced them with temporary workers at worst conditions. The workers asked for backward payments, a bonus for the cost of living, a better health insurance and safety devices on construction sites.
 </p>
<p>
  The conditions of the construction sites are bad, there are no security devices and health coverage is insufficient. Many dismissed workers have been injured at work or suffer from chronic diseases.
 </p>
<p>
  The workers reported to journalists that the criteria for bonuses and increases are obscure, but are constantly provided to people related or connected to the managers. The managers and their assistants receive sumptuous benefits, while workers' salaries remain low.
 </p>
<p>
  Unusually, the police did not try to block the protest, even if in the past he stopped smaller protests. However, on March 4, a protest of the offices of the offices was prevented when the security forces blocked the gates.
 </p>
<p>
  But then hundreds of company security guards refused to start their turn! They asked for higher wages, best benefits, working hours and holidays. “Our salaries are very low, equal to 3,000 le. We work for over 14 hours a day, unlike the rest of the employees. We receive the quarterly bonus at a lower percentage than them, "explained a guard.
 </p>
<p>
  Within 30 minutes, a high manager met them, promising to pay an increase within two months, after which the protest ended.
 </p>
<p>
  Mubarak's regime remains
 </p>
<p>
  The Talaat Moustafa group had enormous contracts for the construction of the new capital that President Sisi supervised. Over the past year, he has tripled his activities in the real estate and hospitality sector, despite the economic crisis of Egypt. In recent months, the price of his actions has risen, gaining millions of dollars to his multimilionary main shareholder, Talaat Moustafa. One of the richest men in Africa was close to Hosni's son Mubarak, Gamal, hated by workers for pushing a vast privatization when the father was president.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2008, Talaat Moustafa was recognized guilty of having paid 2 million dollars to a former policeman to kill the Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim. The other main shareholders of the Talaat Moustafa group are the Bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.
 </p>
<p>
  In February, the company concluded a partnership agreement with the investment company of the United Ame Arab Emirates for the construction of a new and vast tourist city in Ras El-Hikma, on the Mediterranean coast, west of Alexandria. The 35 billion dollar operation, including the sale of land by the army, will greatly help the government of Sisi to pay the 42 billion dollars of debts and the interest it will have to pay this year. There are many questions raised, including the feasibility of the project, its environmental cost, the true value of the land, how to have the ownership of the army, what is the opinion of the local residents (who have not been consulted) e What checks will be on future profits in a "free economic area".
 </p>
<p>
  The desperate need for foreign currency of the Sisi government forced him to sell assets owned by the state. Ras El-Hikma adds to the growing list of Egyptian companies and land now under the property and control of the Gulf.
 </p>
<p>
  The serious inequalities, corruption and brutal repression of the opposition of the regime of the former president Hosni Mubarak have continued, and even increased, under Sisi. Recent strikes and workers' protests could mark the beginning of a new wave of actions of the working class, such as the one developed in the last years of Mubarak.
 </p>
<p>
  The awakening of the Egyptian working class could be a powerful factor to end the Gaza crisis, open the Rafah's pass to humanitarian aid and encourage workers and the poor of the whole Middle East and North Africa to dirty their mega-round rulers throughout the region.
 </p>
<p>
  To end capitalist poverty, war and destruction of the environment, it is necessary to build independent unions and workers' parties with socialist, democratic and internationalist programs.

   NEW YEARS!
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Newroz is the symbol of the
revolt of the exploited and oppressed peoples against the oppressors
and exploiters in the thousands of years of class societies in our
geography. Today, it has become the name of the rebellion and
resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people,
against the persecution of cruelty, the rebellion of the blacksmith
Kawa against the cruel and massacring Dehaks, and the burning of the
fires of rebellion in all four corners.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   We are welcoming Newroz in a
period in which the attacks and massacres of the cruel Dehaks are
increasing worldwide and in our geography. We are in a process where
the conditions for a new imperialist sharing war are maturing and
preparations are being made for it. The increasing rivalry of the
imperialist bourgeoisie is triggering conflicts and occupations at
the regional level. There are not only rivalries and "trade
wars" between the imperialist blocs. The possibility of direct
military confrontation is also increasing. As Russia's war of
occupation of Ukraine evolves into a "protracted war"  war
between the imperialist camps, some spokespersons of the bourgeoisie
make statements that "we must be ready for war".
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The increasing rivalry between
imperialist monopolies is increasing the aggression of reactionary
forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of
the crisis
   <span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<span>
  for their own interests, to expand their areas of
domination and to hold positions. After the Azerbaijani reactionary
occupation of Artsakh-Nagorno-Karabakh, the attacks launched by
Israeli Zionism, citing the October 7 Flood of the Palestinian
national resistance, turned into genocide. The oppressed Palestinian
people were confronted with a new Nakba (catastrophe).
  <span>
</span>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The Turkish state, one of the
most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression
against the Kurdish nation with daily terrorist attacks on the
territory of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria-Rojava
and invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. It is preparing for a
comprehensive invasion attack to liquidate the gains of the Rojava
Revolution and to eliminate the heavy military losses it suffered in
Iraqi Kurdistan. While liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement, the Turkish state is aiming for occupation and then
annexation in the region. It wants to realize its centuries-old
"Misak-ı Milli" goal with the approval of the imperialists
and with its own collaborator reactionary lines in the region.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   For this purpose, after
negotiations with the reactionary forces of the region, a bargain was
struck at the door of US imperialism. The fascist Turkish Republic's
traditional policy of "taking advantage of the contradictions
between the imperialist camps" is once again in effect. Once
again, preparations are being made to attack the oppressed peoples of
our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the isolation
policy is being implemented on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners,
especially Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrest attacks
against revolutionaries continue.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The reason for this aggression
of the Turkish fascism is not independent of the situation it is in.
The century-old regime of oppression and exploitation is in a picture
of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we have
witnessed in the Earthquakes of February 6, while tens of thousands
of people are waiting for help under the debris, they were faced with
a reality of an enemy of the people who did nothing and prevented
those who go to help. The government, which responded to the people's
call for help from the mouth of R.T. Erdogan himself with the curses
"You're immoral, you're despicable, you're dishonorable";
At the current stage, he is once again asking for votes from the
people. The general elections did not solve the crisis of the ruling
classes and even failed to postpone it. At the current stage, they
are once again struggling for rent sharing, this time on the occasion
of local elections.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   While the ruling classes
continue to fight for rent and cliques within themselves, the poverty
of workers and laborers is increasing. Dozens of workers are murdered
every other day in workplace murders. There is an increase in
massacres and hate crimes against women and other gender identities.
Massacres of nature and the environment for the sake of capitalist
rent and plunder continue at full speed. The policy of annihilation,
denial, assimilation and oppression against oppressed nationalities
and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policies
implemented by fascism to maintain its power have created a situation
of social insanity in which torturous massacres of stray animals are
committed.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Turkish state fascism, facing
this picture it has created with its government and opposition, does
what it knows best, fueling racism and chauvinism, under the name of
"social values", it increases its fascist oppression
against "those who are not like itself" and in reality
against all segments that do not obey it. Sunni Islam, the dominant
belief of Turkish fascism, is used as a means of oppressing different
beliefs and to prevent the working and laboring people from rebelling
against the conditions of hunger and poverty they are forced into.
While the policy of "Prayers for Palestine, Ships for Israel"
is continued with determination, fascist aggression against those who
do not bow their heads continues.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Today's cruel Dehaks are at
work. They continue their robbery, extortion and massacres against
the people of the region, especially the people of our country, for
their own wealth and riches. They are preparing new invasions and
attacks for the survival of their regimes built on corruption and
theft. However, there are and will always be blacksmith Kawas against
the cruel Dehaks.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   It is time to be the
blacksmith Kawa against the cruel Dehaks. Now is the time to resist
and struggle. Now is the time to stand up against the oppressors.

<div>
  The historical experience of the Municipality of Paris has fully experienced that it is of extreme importance for the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat to own revolutionary armed forces.

  Speaking of the experience of the Municipality of Paris, Lenin cites an important thesis of Engels, that is, that in France, after each revolution, the workers were armed; The disarmament of the workers was therefore the first commandment for the bourgeois who were in the government of the state. Lenin believes that in this conclusion of Engels, "the essence of the problem, as the essence of the state issue (the oppressed class has weapons?), Is grasped in an admirable way".
  <br/>
  The Paris Commune was born during the fierce struggle between armed revolution and armed counter-revolution. The 72 days of the Paris Commune were 72 days of armed insurrection, armed struggle and armed self-defense. What caused a fear of panic among the bourgeois reactionaries was precisely the
  <span>

</span>
  fact that the proletariat of Paris had challenged the rifle. The fatal error of the Municipality of Paris resided precisely in the fact that it proved too Clemente towards the counter -revolution and did not immediately march on Versailles, what allowed Thiers to resume breath and to gather his reactionary troops to throw himself furiously on revolutionary Paris. How did Engels said: “Would the municipality of Paris last only one day if she had not served this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? On the contrary, one cannot reproach them that you have not served enough? "
  <br/>
<br/>
  Comrade Mao Tse-Tung has concisely recapitulated the important meaning of the armed struggle and the popular army and formulated the famous thesis according to which "political power stems from the rifle rod"
  <br/>
<br/>
  He underlined: "According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the main component of state power. Anyone who wants to take possession of state power and preserve it must have a strong army ".
  <br/>
<br/>
  Violent revolution is a universal principle of proletarian revolution. The Marxist-Leninist parties must firmly follow this universal principle and apply it to the concrete practice of their countries. Historical experience shows that where the proletariat and the oppressed peoples have seized power and won victory, they have done so by rifle force, under the leadership of the proletarian parties, in accordance with the specific conditions of their own countries, gradually building up people's armed forces and waging the people's war on the basis of the broad mobilization of the masses in the struggle and engaging in repeated struggles against the imperialists and reactionaries. This applies to the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, and the Revolution of Albania, Vietnam, Korea and other countries, without exception.
  <br/>
  On the contrary, when the proletarian parties do not try to create revolutionary armed forces or give up, they cause showers to the revolution; There are serious lessons in this regard. Having renounced challenging the rifle, some parties were taken abruptly in the face of an attack by surprise of imperialism and its lacquers and their counter -revolutionary repression and consequently millions of revolutionaries have been massacred; In other cases, since they wanted to obtain places of high officials in bourgeois governments or fell into the trap stretched by the reactionaries, some parties delivered them the popular armed forces, ruining the fruits of the revolution, when the revolutionary people had already challenged the weapons and the weapons Popular armed forces had already developed considerably.
  <br/>
  In these hundred years, many communist parties participated in the elections and entered Parliament, but none of them was able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat with this means. Even if a communist party obtains the majority in Parliament or enters the government, this does not mean that the bourgeois character of political power has changed and even less than the old state machine is demolished. The reactionary dominant class can proclaim the elections, dissolve the parliament or even resort to violence to omit the communists. If a proletarian party, instead of carrying out the work between the masses and engage in the armed struggle, supports the elections zealous
  <br/>
  parliamentarians, it will only fall asleep the masses and corrupt himself. The bourgeoisie buys the communist parties through the parliamentary elections and transforms them into revisionist parties, into bourgeois parties. Doesn't history provide us with numerous examples of this kind?
  <br/>
  The proletariat must conquer political power with the rifle and must also defend it with the rifle. A popular army under the direction of a Marxist-Leninist party is the solid pillar of the proletariat's dictatorship and the main factor between the various factors to prevent the restoration of capitalism. With a popular army armed with Marxist-Leninist ideology, you can face any situation, however complex it may be, in the class struggle both inside and outside the country and defend the power of the proletariat ...

 They are not welcome, we are not a country that welcomes dissent

International Regulations 15 Days of Prolonged Isolation
constitute to all intents and purposes torture and Ilaria has suffered a
isolation for 35 days, but above all he is not serving any

procedural procedure does not in any way guarantee the right to

 Bhagat Singh, SukDev and Rajguru have been hanged by power 
 British colonial to crush the liberation movement 
 anti-colonial of that time. The victory of the Bolshevik Revolution 
 he had influenced these three Indian revolutionaries who formed 
 of HSRA (Hindustan's socialist revolutionary association). The 
 Comrade Baghat Singh played a fundamental role in training 
 of the HSRA, and clearly stated that whatever the color 
 dominant classes, whether they are white, black or other skin, it must be 
 continue the fight against all exploiters.

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

<strong>
</strong>
<br>
  In our long history of people’s democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br br="">
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces, Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India, Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro- imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br br=""/>
  the Adivasi region. People’s resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP’S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this enemy’s machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and women’s organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

<p>
  On Thursday, March 21st, an event took place in the international center B5 on the occasion of March 18, the day of the political capture and anniversary of the Paris municipality. The Hamburg Palestine alliance invited to the event.
 </p>
<p>
  It started with a cultural contribution in which activists of the Red Federation sang the song "The Women of the Community". Then they explained the backgrounds of March 18 as the anniversary of the Paris community. The new interview with Professor Saibaba, which was recently released, was announced.
 </p>
<p>
  It was also reported by Young Struggle on the situation of political prisoners in Turkey and Kurdistan, the torture methods in the knots, prison types and explained how the prison system was expanded to accommodate the revolutionary capture.
 </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Representatives of the PrisonerInfo also reported on the background of the arrest of Daniela Klette, what she is accused of, how she is humiliated and on the rally that took place on Sunday, March 10 in Vechta, where solidarity was shown. The organizer of the rally, a member of the works council at the hospital in Bremen, has even been banned from the clinic where she works. In the meantime, the repression against this person has taken on such absurd traits that professional bans are once again in the air, only for political ideas that one has – i.e. basically justice of opinions.
 </p>
<p>
  In the discussion, once again, in the times when the masses in the world - especially in Palestine - fight and are also on the move in the FRG, important topics are set on the agenda. In this way, the discussion quickly came to important basic questions of revolutionary work and, above all, whether the revolutionaries should continue to wait to show the masses the right way to exemption, about whether they have to show in practice how this struggle is to be carried out. In short: whether missionaries are needed or an actual revolutionary vanguard.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  KP Sharma Oli, Chairman of the CPN-UML, has dismissed speculations regarding his party’s potential entry into the Socialist Front of Nepal. This came following a discussion with Prime Minister and Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre), Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
 </p>
<p>
  Contrary to earlier reports suggesting UML’s integration into the Socialist Front of Nepal, Chairman Oli clarified the party’s stance, refuting any such plans.
 </p>
<p>
  The decision came after a meeting between PM Dahal and Chairman Oli, where the matter was deliberated upon.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the Socialist Front’s earlier decision to extend an invitation to the CPN-UML, Chairman Oli’s statement firmly denies the possibility.
 </p>
<p>
  The Socialist Front of Nepal, formed on June 19, 2023, comprises four parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand.
 </p>
<p>
  With a collective representation of 54 lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the parties affiliated to the newly established Socialist Front of Nepal have made their presence felt in the political arena.

           The Yugoslavia war led to a deep split within the peoples in the Balkans. Under the pretext of "peace promotion", NATO intervened. From then on, the “peace” created after the war meant an area occupied by the UN troops named KFor (Kosovo Force). These troops are a military formation under the direction of NATO. The KFOR group is provided by 28 countries and has been comprising 4,443 soldiers since January 2024. Since then, Austria has also regularly sent around 500 soldiers. From April, a third of the company will be deducted from Kosovo in order to be able to provide Austrian soldiers for EU combat forces. Not only that neutrality has always been broken, the basis for the economic use of the Balkan countries for Austrian capital could be created from the start.

           The "Independent Republic of Kosovo" was proclaimed in February 2008. Nevertheless, Kosovo is led by the EU Council by a Mission (Eulex Kosovo). Among other things, this mission is intended to support the establishment of the Kosovar Republic in the rule of law and the maintenance of public order. This creates a means to secure the interests of the EU imperialists in the Balkans. With inserts of the flimsy "peacekeeping", the endeavor to expand the EU was also secured. There can be no question of an “independent” republic if the state is managed by an international military commission and permanent NATO base points are available in the country. This is the clear proof that the imperialists are not to support the "freedom" in the country, but only to secure their influence and power.

           The consequences of the Yugoslavia war can still be felt today. Even today, the ruling Austria also benefit from this war. Mass unemployment, corruption, poor living conditions are still partly the consequences of the war today. The peoples in the Balkans have been protesting against corruption, against pole age repression, against NATO base and also against the efforts to join the EU. In Croatia, as an EU member state, the population suffers from the introduction of the euro.

<p>
  In the International Military Tribunal, know as the Nuremberg trial, the Soviet Union together with Yankee, British and French imperialism tried crimes of the European Axis, mainly by the Nazis.
 </p>
<p>
  In the
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/nuremberg-tribunal-charter-1945">
   Charter of the International Military Tribunal
  </a>
  , war crimes is defined as follows:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ War crimes: ‘ namely, violations of the laws or customs of war. Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages,  or devastation not justified by military necessity;”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  In addition the Soviet Union proposed to include crimes against civilians, which were defined in the Charter as crimes against humanity:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ Crimes against humanity: ‘ namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The charter also established that not only the individual directly committing an act is responsible for the crime:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Regarding war crimes we have already
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/19/gaza-famine-is-imminent/">
   reported
  </a>
  on some of the violation of laws of war committed by the State of Israel. With neglecting to provide necessary supplies to the population under its occupation and further blocking other parties from delivering these supplies, in addition to destroying necessary infrastructure such as water wells and poisoning the groundwater with seawater, the State of Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. These acts violates

In addition more than 8,000 people are missing, likely dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings. With this the real death toll is likely closer to 2% of the Palestinians in Gaza. The imminent famine and continuing military attacks against civilians point toward even larger parts of the population being murdered. The State of Israel has also forcefully displaced almost

  , more than half of the homes of Gaza, have been destroyed or damaged. Only 12 out of 35 hospitals are partially functioning. 392 educational facilities have been destroyed or damaged. 83% of groundwater wells are not operational. 267 places of worship have been destroyed or damaged. According to
  <a href="https://undark.org/2024/03/13/satellites-show-damaged-buildings-gaza/">
   satellite images
  </a>
  an estimated 157,200 buildings have been damaged or destroyed. In densely populated areas more than half of all buildings have been destroyed. In northern Gaza almost three-fourths of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. There is no doubt that the State of Israel is committing “
  <em>
   wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity”.

  The mentioned war crimes are also crimes against humanity: “
  <em>
   murder, … deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population
  </em>
  ”. The
  <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf">
   Rome Statute
  </a>
  of the International Criminal Court expands on “
  <em>
   extermination

  ” as a crime against humanity:
  <em>
   “’Extermination’ includes the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The State of Israel is not only committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, they are carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. The
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/genocide-conv-1948">
   Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
  </a>
  from 1948, defines genocide as “
  <em>
   any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (a) Killing members of the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

<p>
<em>
   (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  We have already explained how the State of Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily harm, and inflicting upon them conditions of life such as starvation. Since last October Israeli officials have at many times publicly revealed their genocidal intention and have made direct and public incitement to genocide. Many examples of these are included in South Africa’s

  </a>
  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for charging the State of Israel for genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made many statements dehumanizing the Palestinian people and called for exterminating them. On the 15

  <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke-start151023">

  to the Israeli Knesset, he described the situation as “a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle”. In his “

  <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2023-10-13/israeli-president-says-gazans-could-have-risen-up-to-fight-hamas">
   stated
  </a>
  the following in a press conference: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.” He has also made
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/173933430267074594">
   handwritten messages
  </a>
  on bombs dropped in Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’
  <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel">
   stated
  </a>
  that Israel was “imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” He has further made the genocidal plan clear by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjHcnNB0E8">
   stating
  </a>
  the following: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”
 </p>
<p>
  On the 10

  of November the Israeli Minister for National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, clarified the government’s position,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1723784790682358189">
   stating
  </a>
  : “[t]o be clear, when we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy — they’re all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.”
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Heritage, Amachai Eliyahu,
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyau.a/videos/148918588283326/">
   stated
  </a>
  the following on the 1
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  of November: “The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes … We must talk about the day after. In my mind, we will hand over lots to all those who fought for Gaza over the years and to those evicted from Gush Katif” [a former Israeli settlement].
 </p>
<p>
  Israeli Army Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (‘Cagat’), Major General Ghassan Alian, Statted the following in an official
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5a0EWv-o7mE">
   video statement
  </a>
  addressed to Hamas and Gaza residents: “Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”
 </p>
<p>
  Giora Eiland, Israeli Army Reservist Major General, former Head of the Israeli National Security Council, and adviser to the Defense Minister, has, among many genocidal statements, incited genocide by targeting the water supply,
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5Ow2T0Na20BcoL2yautiobij8ldNsVK/view">
   noting
  </a>
  that water in Gaza “comes from wells with salt water unfit for consumption. They have water treatment plants, Israel should hit those plants.” He has also
  <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sju3uabba">
   stated
  </a>
  that “Israel needs to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, compelling tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Egypt or the Gulf … Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist”. If the genocidal intentions of the State of Israel was not already clear, Eiland makes sure to clarify this by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/TalulaSha/status/1726267178201362438">
   stating
  </a>
  that: “When senior Israeli figures say in the media ‘It’s either us or them’ we should clarify the question of who is ‘them’. ‘They’ are not only Hamas fighters with weapons, but also all the ‘civilian’ officials, including hospital administrators and school administrators, and also the entire Gaza population who enthusiastically supported Hamas and cheered on its atrocities on October 7th.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the facts of the ongoing genocide being clear, the signatures of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, including the imperialists, are obliged to prevent and punish it.
 </p>
<p>
  However, not only are the imperialists negating this obligation, some of the imperialists are also complicit in the genocide. We already

  to suppress the popular support for the Palestinian people. The British Home Secretary has sent a

  to police chiefs in England and Wales, stating that waving the Palestinian flag, and shouting slogans such as ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’, may be a criminal offense.” Accordingly German imperialism faces accusations of being complicit in the genocide at the ICJ.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialists have only widened their support for the genocide since this. Yankee President, Joe Biden, is currently working on giving a further

  While we here have focused on crimes committed in the current campaign against Gaza, the peoples of the world will not forget the other crimes committed by the State of Israel since it was established, and the crimes it is currently committing in the West Bank, such as the increasing amount of illegal settlements, as well as the crime of apartheid within the annexed territory.

The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information.

The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7.

No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2.

Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/><br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/><br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means. In particular, such measures shall  be implemented in the case of a victim of sexual violence or a child who is a victim or a witness, unless  otherwise ordered by the Court, having regard to all the circumstances, particularly the views of the victim  or witness.  3. Where the personal interests of the victims are affected, the Court shall permit their views and concerns to  be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court and in  a manner which is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial  trial. Such views and concerns may be presented by the legal representatives of the victims where the Court  considers it appropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. The Victims and Witnesses Unit may advise the Prosecutor and the Court on appropriate protective  measures, security arrangements, counselling and assistance as referred to in article 43, paragraph 6. <br/><br/>34 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court5. Where the disclosure of evidence or information pursuant to this Statute may lead to the grave endangerment  of the security of a witness or his or her family, the Prosecutor may, for the purposes of any proceedings  conducted prior to the commencement of the trial, withhold such evidence or information and instead  submit a summary thereof. Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or  inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial.  6. A State may make an application for necessary measures to be taken in respect of the protection of its  servants or agents and the protection of confidential or sensitive information.

Before testifying, each witness shall, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, give an  undertaking as to the truthfulness of the evidence to be given by that witness.  2. The testimony of a witness at trial shall be given in person, except to the extent provided by the measures  set forth in article 68 or in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The Court may also permit the giving of  viva voce (oral) or recorded testimony of a witness by means of video or audio technology, as well as the  introduction of documents or written transcripts, subject to this Statute and in accordance with the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the  accused.  3. The parties may submit evidence relevant to the case, in accordance with article 64. The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4. The Court may rule on the relevance or admissibility of any evidence, taking into account, inter alia , the  probative value of the evidence and any prejudice that such evidence may cause to a fair trial or to a fair  evaluation of the testimony of a witness, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  5. The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial notice of them.  7. Evidence obtained by means of a violation of this Statute or internationally recognized human rights shall  not be admissible if:  (a) The violation casts substantial doubt on the reliability of the evidence; or  (b) The admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of  the proceedings. 8. When deciding on the relevance or admissibility of evidence collected by a State, the Court shall not rule  on the application of the State's national law.  Article 70   Offences against the administration of justice 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over the following offences against its administration of justice when  committed intentionally:  (a) Giving false testimony when under an obligation pursuant to article 69, paragraph 1, to tell the truth;  (b) Presenting evidence that the party knows is false or forged;  (c) Corruptly influencing a witness, obstructing or interfering with the attendance or testimony of a  witness, retaliating against a witness for giving testimony or destroying, tampering with or interfering  with the collection of evidence;  (d) Impeding, intimidating or corruptly influencing an official of the Court for the purpose of forcing or  persuading the official not to perform, or to perform improperly, his or her duties;  (e) Retaliating against an official of the Court on account of duties performed by that or another official;  (f) Soliciting or accepting a bribe as an official of the Court in connection with his or her official duties. 2.

The conditions for providing  international cooperation to the Court with respect to its proceedings under this article shall be governed  by the domestic laws of the requested State. <br/><br/>35 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3. In the event of conviction, the Court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, or a fine  in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, or both.  4. (a) Each State Party shall extend its criminal laws penalizing offences against the integrity of its own     investigative or judicial process to offences against the administration of justice referred to in this     article, committed on its territory, or by one of its nationals;  (b) Upon request by the Court, whenever it deems it proper, the State Party shall submit the case to its  competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall treat such cases with  diligence and devote sufficient resources to enable them to be conducted effectively. Article 71   Sanctions for misconduct before the Court 1. The Court may sanction persons present before it who commit misconduct, including disruption of its  proceedings or deliberate refusal to comply with its directions, by administrative measures other than  imprisonment, such as temporary or permanent removal from the courtroom, a fine or other similar  measures provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  2. The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6.

Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  Thousands of Greenlandic women were involuntarily implanted with IUDs to prevent them from becoming pregnant in the 1960s-1970s by the Danish colonial authorities. This was done to reduce population growth in Greenland – a cruel and cynical expression of population control as part of Danish imperialism’s colonial policy in Greenland.

  During the 1950s to 1960s, the birth rate in Greenland increased by 80%, with 1.781 children born per year in 1966. In 1966, the decision was made by the Ministry of Greenland and the Danish National Board of Health to implant IUDs in 4,500 of Greenland’s 9.000 estimated fertile women, that is 50%. Greenland’s population at the time was around 40.500. The so-called “IUD campaign” reached its peak intensity in the period between 1966 and the 1970s, when the procedures were performed without the consent of young women, some as young as 12 years old. Danish imperialism succeeded in slowing population growth through its cynical abuses, but in 1974 it was forced to abandon the policy. Not because it regretted its failures, but because its policy had succeeded and it feared a backlash in the form of rebellion and criticism of its policy from the UN – several of whose conventions had been violated throughout the process.

  The forced state contraception was carried out during a period when Greenland had formally ceased to be a Danish colony – but still is in practice today. At this time, however, Greenland was still subject to the Ministry of Greenland in the government, which oversaw the introduction of the coercive measures in the so-called IUD Campaign. The abuses were allegedly done so that population growth would not prevent the modernization of Greenland, in other words: not to get in the way of Danish imperialism’s desire to continue its dominance over Greenland. Many people in Greenland do not speak Danish, yet only Danish was spoken in the operating rooms and the doctors were Danes. Many of the girls were not informed that they were being sterilized, both because of the language barrier, but also because it was kept secret from them and their families.

<p>
  Greenland’s population growth has never recovered since the IUD Campaign and the population of Greenland has stagnated since the 1990s.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the policy was officially abandoned in 1974, it was unofficially continued for many years. In 1992, the local authorities in Greenland took over the health sector, where the policy continued with a further 14 Greenlandic women having IUDs implanted without consent.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  The abuse has caused permanent damage to many women today, who experience many discomforts such as pelvic inflammatory disease, severe pain, irregular bleeding and permanent tissue damage and sterilization. The IUDs used at the time were of the Lippes Loop type and were much larger than those used today, and were only intended for women who had already given birth before. For this reason, among others, the IUD has led to permanent trauma in many women’s abdomens after being in place for decades.
 </p>
<p>
  Involuntary contraception is not just a thing of the distant past either. In an interview with 4 Greenlandic women, the British media BBC has revealed how at least 4 cases of involuntary birth control have been known to have been carried out by the authorities in Greenland since the turn of the millennium. Information has also
  <a href="">
   reported
  </a>
  on at least three involuntary induced abortions performed by the authorities in 2004, 2010 and 2013.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, 143 Greenlandic women are suing the Danish state, seeking compensation of 300.000 DKK [Note by translator: around 44.000 USD] each for their suffering. This case is currently receiving a lot of media attention. The bourgeois Danish state and the authorities in Greenland are currently using the case as part of a “historical investigation of the Danish-Greenlandic history”, 45 million DKK [Note by translator: around 6,5 million USD] has been allocated by the state for this purpose. This investigation is part of the ongoing process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands to go from colonies to semi-colonies. Danish imperialism therefore needs to admit many of its crimes and come clean about them in order to continue its exploitation of Greenland and its strategic position in the Arctic.
 </p>
<p>
  The transition from colony to semi-colony for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should be understood as a deliberate act of Danish imperialism. It is a way for it to refine its exploitation of the countries, as this is more stable than the official colonial form. At the same time, it is an expression of the fact that revolution is the main trend in the world today, it is a sign of the decay of imperialism and the collapse of the last remnants of the colonial system in the world. Danish imperialism has learned the lessons of the people’s anti-colonial struggles in mainly Africa and Asia and has chosen to stay ahead of them by dictating the process itself. The inter-imperialist contradictions must also be taken into account, with mainly Yankee imperialism taking a renewed interest in the Arctic in its struggle against Russian imperialism. At the same time, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has now attracted the attention of other imperialists who want to develop mining in Greenland.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
<img alt="" class="wp-image-10198" decoding="async" height="759" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SpiralCampaign_5.webp" srcset="https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SpiralCampaign_5.webp" width="900"/>
</figure>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should therefore be understood as a sign of weakness for Danish imperialism and imperialism in general, which is no longer able to maintain colonies, and that the masses in Greenland and the Faroe Islands defiantly continue to combat and resist.

  network of spy satellites called ”Starshield” under a classified contract with the US government. SpaceX has a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which includes personnel from the CIA and the Space Forces, to build a network of satellites able to quickly single out military targets almost anywhere in the world to support the ground forces of US imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  “The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,” a spokesperson for the NRO described the system. According to sources close to the project, the system would be so extensive that ”no one could hide”. The spy system would consist of low-orbiting satellites able to provide the US military with detailed images of the Earth, and it would also be

   more immun
  </a>
  e to disruptions, which the US says especially Russian imperialism would attempt to cause to its satellites. This system would provide information faster and near-constantly compared to old-type of higher-orbiting satellites.
 </p>
<p>
  Chinese social-imperialism has its own aspirations regarding the militarization of space, and its own spy satellite network program, and it immediately
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/world/china-s-military-state-media-slam-u-s-after-reuters-report-on-spacex-spy-satellites/ar-BB1k54mu">
   expressed
  </a>
  its concern over ”Starshield” and accused the US of escalating tensions and threatening “global security”. Russian imperialism
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/russia-warns-united-states-use-of-spacex-for-spying-makes-its-satellites-a-target/ar-BB1kdw8l">
   warned
  </a>
  the US that through using commercial satellites for military purposes, these satellites become legitimate military targets.
 </p>
<p>
  In one hand, as is highlighted in the mainstream media, Starshield reflects the US asserting its position as the sole hegemonic superpower over Russian imperialism, as well as Chinese social-imperialism, with a massive militarization of space, using the most advanced new technologies. In the other hand, and mainly, corresponding to the main contradiction in the world today, it is spearheaded against the oppressed nations, in order to increase repression against their struggle for liberation, “so that no one can hide” from the all-seeing eye of Yankee imperialism. Here it is necessary to note however that even though imperialists highlight how advanced, how “omnipotent” this technology is, faced with the peoples of the world it is only a paper tiger.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2021, the US Department of Defense (DoD) officials
  <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2629675/space-based-capabilities-critical-to-us-national-security-dod-officials-say/">
   said
  </a>
  that space-based capabilities are critical for the US and that the US has to be prepared to conflicts which extent to space or even originate there, not meaning that war would be waged in space but that space would play a role in armed conflicts on Earth. In this context, DoD described as the main threat the space aspirations of Russian imperialism and Chinese social-imperialism: “Russia and China view space as critical to modern warfare and consider the use of counterspace capabilities as both a means of reducing U.S. military effectiveness and winning future wars”, DoD principal director for space policy said.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX is the largest operator of satellites in the world. The first SpaceX satellite was developed under a contract with the US, and its Falcon 9 rockets have been used to transport US military payloads to space. Already before Starshield SpaceX had aspirations to sell its Starlink technology to the US Department of Defense, but what the US imperialism wanted was technology specifically engineered to meet its needs.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX has already around 5,500 commercial Starlink satellites orbiting the Earth. These provide internet for different actors, and it is used among others by the Ukrainian military for communications. SpaceX sent 22,000 Starlink terminals to Ukraine in the first year since the beginning of the war of aggression, and they have played a “significant role”
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/10/europe/ukraine-starlink-not-active-crimea-intl-hnk/index.html">
   according
   said
  </a>
  it has evidence Starlink has been used also by Russia. The war of aggression in Ukraine has therefore in one hand served to refine the technology for military purposes, and in the other it has shown the capabilities of such technology and the “necessity” of the increasing militarization of space for the imperialists. Therefore it has raised the interest of US imperialism to ensure such technology serves its interests only and can be used extensively for this – and to this the Starshield system answers.
 </p>
<p>
  It is
  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/airpower-after-ukraine/commercial-satellites-are-on-the-front-lines-of-war-today-heres-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-warfare/">
   claimed
  </a>
  that as the costs of launching satellites and rockets to space lower and more and more commercial companies pop up, it “democratizes” the space. This is of course a similar machination as the free competition and “the American dream” under capitalism, that today has reached the stage of imperialism, and the tendency of monopolization and struggle for hegemony is seen also in space and this commercialization of space is used by the imperialists to achieve their interests. It is openly stated by US experts that using commercial technologies for military purposes is the future, and companies are put to develop military technologies in close contact with the US government. Trae Stephens, a principal at Founders Fund, whose investments include SpaceX, said in 2023 that the war of aggression has woken up members of the financial oligarchy to see the potential in military technologies instead of civilian infrastructure. This means deeper militarization of society.

  As the general crisis of imperialism develops further and further, it becomes more and more urgent for the imperialists to develop all-encompassing militarization, that even reaches space. Technological advancement is put to serve destruction and the maintaining of oppression, the hegemony of the US imperialism in the world. This is a sign of weakness, and as has been seen multiple times, despite its technological overpower, it has experienced and keeps on experiencing devastating blows from the peoples of the world.

  Approximately 100 farmers organized by the Poor Peasant Association Jaqueira (Pernambuco) from various communities took back their water source, which had been fenced by a large farmer company.

<p>
  March 18, about 100 LCP farmer conquerors in Jaqueira, Pernambuco (PE) communities (Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabugi, Monteir, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa d'Andua, Tenório and Sítio Grande) combined their power He surrounded the large farming company Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A, owned by the farm of the farm Guilherme Maranhão.
 </p>
<p>
  Since 2015, when the robbery of countries and water sources began, the peasants have lived and produced the former Frei Caneca farm. Former Government Maranhãp, supported by former governor Paulo Camara, set up gun groups that threaten the entire population to expand cattle breeding to international export through the slaughterhouse.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite comprehensive evidence of water poisoning by the pest of the water (in addition to the pollution of cattle and the pollution), the Pernambuco Public Ministry (MPPE) and the Pernambuco Environmental Secretariat (CPRH) never began any criminal investigation by Agroopocuárin Mata S/A.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, at the People's Assembly, the peasants decided to implement a large act to take the water sources back from the large farm. The invitation reached the entire local population in flying markets and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts to clean and isolated water sources, 50 meters from the livestock farmer and eucalyptus plantations.

  To do all this work, the status advocates dropped José Ricardo's revolutionary area of peasants and young students in the Mangue Vermelho movement. They helped to clear the bushes and mark fences to protect water sources in the scorching sun. More, they met alongside the rest of the people, fighting the provocations of the gentlemen.

  As soon as the peasants had completed their joint effort with the first water source of the day, singing folk songs and shouting slogans, half -time rifle from large farms appeared with tractors, stage farms, motorcycles and quads. The gunmen arrived with the posts, thread and eucalyptus seeds to put them in the same area that the peasants had just cleared. When the peasant march faced bands, representatives of the farmland began to threaten the peasants with firearms. The voltage led to a confrontation, three guns were injured, and the droon of the big farm was destroyed by the furious folk of firearms.
 </p>
<p>
  This same March 18: A MPPE agricultural promoter, CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee to monitor agrarian conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the pasture commission (CPT) and Pernambuco workers and peasant federation (Fetape) perhaps A large farming company Agropecuária from Mata Sul S/A visited to study complaints of the peasants made by the farm. According to this information, this Commission did not visit the water sources of the peasants, but only to the places shown in the farm.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the powerful action of the peasants forced the entire Commission to introduce the act at the scene of the Aktio and to approve two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Folk Alliance (Abrapo) and the Commission of the Barro Branco Farm Association, and also had to accept the urgent conditions of the people in the public.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, Mppe approved the proposal for the peasants represented by Abrapo to create a "water corridor" to separate the water sources of the people. The status of the farm was ordered to pay the poles and the thread, the city administration sends employees and it was the responsibility of the State Environmental Department to investigate people's waters to determine pollution and to open a criminal investigation against the farm.
 </p>
<p>
  After hearing the court, Guilherme Maranhão's gunmen asked for reinforcements from the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to plant eucalyptus to one of the water sources, which had been cleaned up by the peasants, and the farm lawyer Eduardo Figueredo proclaimed that they would complete the milestone.
 </p>
<p>
  Two vehicles were sent to bring security to the gunmen to continue their anti -folk action. This is not a courage to show, but rather a cowardice in front of a small display of peasants connected and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how dedicated the military forces of this old state are about protecting the interests of the state of space and promoting the poverty of the poor in the country and in the city.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasants occupying the former Frei Caneca status are determined to take back all their water sources and their land from the hands of the farm. In this way, they invite all peasants in the southern forest area of the Pernambuco to rise against the rifle groups of large farms and the armed forces of this old state. Without destruction, large farms can never be entitled to the poor of the rural rural.

  On March 19, the São Benedito Peasant Community, in the municipality of São Bernardo, Maranhão, denounced in its social network criminal activities of land grabbers that threaten the life of the local population. In the video, a ten -year -old reports attempts at invasion and dirt theft, but that the peasants “won't leave”. It also shows the intense peasant production on site.
 </p>
<p>
  The community has over 200 years of existence, with lands passed from generation to generation, in which residents work in the fields for their subsistence. According to what was documented by them,
  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/asso_sao_benedito_ma/?g=5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   through social networks

  Similar situations have grown throughout the state of Maranhão, especially after the implementation of the “Grabbilage Law”, sanctioned by Governor Carlos Brandão. Being an updated version of the well-known Sarney de Land Law, the legislation that expands the possibility of regularization of public land from 200 to 2,500 hectares, serving as an instrument for landowners, on behalf of agribusiness, feel the right to commit Heinous acts of violence against the peasant people, indigenous and quilombolas.

   As we have already denounced (*), the Egyptian regime of Al Sisi is making a fence in the Sinai desert to lock the Palestinians on the run from Gaza, and thus facilitate the "ethnic cleaning" by Israel, in exchange for funding of the Ill.
  </p>
<p>
   The Egyptian regime is dominated by the military, who are also among the major capitalists of the country. "Pharaonic" affected business, such as the construction of the new capital (with enormous profits for themselves and for friends), have also magnified the debt of the state and now the only payment of interest on the debt weighs for over 10% of the GDP. Solution: print money, then create inflation, that is, cut the purchasing power of wages to maintain the profits of the owners, private, state and military.
   <br>
   In September 2023 the inflation had reached 40%, that is, the purchasing power of the already miserable wages and salaries had undergone a 40%cut.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Fearing the discontent for hunger wages also among public employees, the government has decreed the increase in the minimum wage from 4,000 to 6,000 Egyptian pounds (at the current gearbox, today 120 euros per month). For private employees, however, the minimum wage was brought to only 3,500.
   <br>
   In January, to workers who protested for the low wages, at Sisi he had the shamelessness of responding: “We don't eat? Let's eat. We don't drink? We drink, and everything works [and here he had made an obscene, sprinkling, comparison with the condition of the Palestinians deliberately hungry and thirsty by the Zionist state - ed.]. Are things expensive and some are not available? So?".
  </br></p>

</p>

</a>
<b>
   Mahalla al-Kubra in the Nile delta, who has more than a century of history and struggles, arrived on February 22nd.
  </b>
<b>
   Discaning the protest slogans went on strike in 3,700.
  </b>
  Despite the intervention of the guards to prevent them from accessing the Central Piazzale, and the descenda in the field of the official union against the strike, the strike, supported by an independent union, has extended to at least 7 thousand workers.
  <br/>
  The response of the masters and the government was: stick and carrot. Minimum salary at 6,000 le (a 70%increase), arrest of 13 "leader" of the strike (source: Labourstart), of which two still held on March 13, are also threatened with dismissal due to unjustified absence.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   Evidently masters and government count on the continuation of inflation (still at 31% in January 2024), which will remain the increases, and the arrests are a warning to anyone, in Mahalla or elsewhere, came to mind to return to the struggle.
   <br/>
   But letting the strike continues without concessions seemed too dangerous to the government: he would have risked a generalized explosion because he knows that the strong increase in the cost of living has increased the pressure between the workers.
   <br/>
   An explosion that could connect to popular support to the Palestinian cause that is in Egypt, although the military regime does everything that may not to show it, and to the more general discontent for the heavy working and life conditions of millions of proletarians.
  </p>
<p>
   On the same days, in fact, hundreds of workers of a large construction company owned by the billionaire Talaat Moustafa, in companies with the Saudi family of the Bin Laden, fell into struggle.
  </p>
  They protested against the dismissal of permanent workers (especially those who have undergone accidents at work or have fallen sick) to hire workers with precarious contracts, and asking for the payment of arrears, a wage increase for caravan, safety measures and devices protection on construction sites, greater health coverage.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   In this case it is significant that the company guards, who a week earlier had intervened to repress a protest of the employees, a few days later they refused to enter service, complaining about being paid the 3000 (60 euros) per month For 14 hours of work a day, and have obtained an increase.
  </p>
<p>
   The Talaat Moustafa group, which has become a giant with orders for the new capital, is now participating in companies with the ADQ of the Emirates group in a 35 billion dollar project for the construction of a tourist city on the Mediterranean coast, on land privatized by military.
  </p>
<p>
   These episodes of workers are indicative of a social temperature that is going up to Egypt as in other countries of the Middle East and which could lead to new explosions if the economic crisis will worsen, in connection also with the anger caused by the genocidal war of Israel against The population of Gaza.
   <br/>
   It is no coincidence that the IMF offers Al-Sisi billions in exchange for work dirty with collaboration with Israel; While on their part Meloni and Von del Leyen promise 7.4 billion euros to Egypt because he does the equally dirty work of retaining emigrants to Europe, as well as for other lucrative business.
  </p>
<p>
   We allow ourselves to repeat it: the only true friends of the Palestinians attacked and oppressed by Israel to Gaza and in West Bank are the workers and the exploited of the region and the world, not the Arab capitalist governments who exploit and repress their workers and are ready to do Business by collaborating with the imperialist metropolis in the repression of Palestinians and migrants.

    Thousands of workers strike for the increase in wages in the Ghazl al-Mahalla factory
   </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
   - Di Beesan Kassab, 25 Febbraio 2024
  </p>
<p>
   Ghazl Al-Mahalla's workers are on strike to obtain higher wages and more equipped bonuses.
  </p>
<p>
   About 7,000 workers met on Saturday morning in the central square of the Ghazl al-Mahalla industrial complex for a strike that has already lasted for three days.
  </p>
<p>
   They ask that their daily meal is increased to 30 the [= 0.57 euros], raising a choir in which the amount is said to barely cover "the price of a liter of milk".
  </p>
<p>
   They also ask for the application of higher wages, referring to a recent wage increase for the public sector based on instructions by President Abdel Fattoh Al-Sisi, in the midst of an inflationary wave that has raised the cost of living at national level . In other slogans, workers asked: "Where is Sisi's decision?".
  </p>
<p>
   The mega-phabbrica of public property uses tens of thousands of people in the sectors of spinning, textile and medical cotton, as well as a power plant on a huge area of land in Mahalla al-Kubra, in the Governorate of Gharbiya.
  </p>
<p>
   Until Sunday, the negotiations of workers with the parent company have failed, said the center for unions and services to workers in a release released on Saturday evening. The meeting was attended by a representative of the Presidency, of the Labor Office, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the President of the General Union of Filaure and Weaving.
  </p>
<p>
   Several men who work in the company were held on Saturday by the National Security Agency after being summoned to be interrogated by the safety body together with some workers, said Ctws, without specifying the number of prisoners.
  </p>
<p>
   The workers launched the strike on Thursday [February 22], they told Mada Masr, starting in the prevalence of female clothing factories, which historically were at the forefront of several famous strikes of the company.
  </p>
<p>
   Hanan*, supervisor of a clothing factory, told Mada Masr that the workers of his building began to mark slogans, finally interrupting the work while the songs spread from one factory to another.
  </p>
<p>
   At the same time, the security staff sealed the exits to prevent women from pouring into the central square of the complex, known as Piazza Talaat Harb. This safety measure was also applied to the power plant, according to Abdullah* who works there.
  </p>

   The security staff unlocked the gates of the factory around 15.00 on Thursday, half an hour before the end of the morning round, to make sure the workers left the premises and did not meet inside, said Hanan.
  </p>
<p>
   The company's workers described the low wages as a cause of dissatisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   The cost of living has increased throughout the country, with an inflation that will exceed 30% in 2024. A recent "presidential package", which will be launched starting from March, provides for an increase in the minimum wage for the 4,000 public sector At 6,000 per month, with increases ranging from 1,000 to 1,200 per various job categories.
  </p>
<p>
   Although it is owned by the state, the Misr Spinning and Weiving Company, which owns Ghazl al-Mahalla, does not fall within the context of the presidential package, told Mada Masr a source of the Ministry of Finance.
  </p>
<p>
   The wages of the company are instead guided by the decisions of the National Council for Salari, which last October raised the minimum wage of the private sector to 3,500 le.
  </p>
<p>
   But the increase in October did not serve to contrast the reduction of purchasing power caused by inflation. After more than 25 years of service, Abdel Aziz* told Mada Masr that his total gain does not exceed 4,000 a month. The figure is equivalent to about $ 130 at the official exchange rate, or about 80 dollars at the rate of the market parallel to the time we write.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdullah said that his salary is 4,200 Lee after 33 years of work with the company. Hanan, who is approaching the pension, receives a salary of about 6,200 he.
  </p>
<p>
   Several sources of work of the company said that days before the strike, Gharbiya governor had made a series of visits to inspect a convoy that provides subsidized assets to the company's workers.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdel Aziz added that during Wednesday's visit, the Governor inspected a medical convoy that supplies the workers and "a worker told the Governor that his salary does not exceed 3500 le".
  </p>
<p>
   According to a declaration of the Ctws published on Saturday, the workers now ask that the minimum salary is brought to 6,000 le, with wage increases based on the seniority of service and a reduction of tax appropriations.
  </p>
<p>
   They also ask that their daily allowance for meals increased to 30 le, for a total of 900 per month instead of the current 210 per month, with a song circulating during the strike in which it was stated that the amount covers a barely "the price of a liter of milk".
  </p>
<p>
   The Ctws declaration of Saturday [February 24] stressed that the members of the company's official trade union committee, affiliated to the Egyptian union federation aligned to the state, tried to dissuade workers from the strike and to intimidate them, but were expelled from the square .
  </p>
<p>
   A prominent figure of the company's official trade union committee declared on Thursday in Mada Masr, on condition of anonymity, that the committee "prefers negotiation to the strike, but supports workers' requests".
  </p>
<p>
   Ghazl Al-Mahalla acted as a catalyst in late 2006 for a rebirth of the union action at national level, when a strike of tens of thousands of workers in the factory reverberated in a movement of similar strikes in other factories in the country.

   Geneva - March 6, 2024
  </p>
<p>
   In a worrying development, the national security of Gharbia, in Egypt, would have retained at least five employees of the renowned textile company Ghazl El-Mahalla, despite the workers' decision to disperse their strike on February 29, 2024.
   <br/>
   The employees started the strike to request the application of the minimum wage.
  </p>
<p>
   Among the prisoners are Wael Abu Zuwayed and Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, currently held at the national security office for so much. They are added to three other workers, Sabah Ali Al-Qattan, Muhammad Al-Attar and Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, also detained.
  </p>
<p>
   Wael Abu Zuwayed was brought to the Cairo State Security Prosecutor's Office, where it was decided to retain it in pre -trial detention for 15 days. He is accused of having joined a group formed in violation of the law and of having released false information.
  </p>
<p>
   With a controversial move, on March 4, the direction of Ghazl El Mahalla issued notices of dismissal for the workers detained, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed and Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. The company claims that their absence from work lasted ten days, appropriately ignoring that it took place following their detention by national security.
  </p>
<p>
   The Justice Committee (CFJ) has condemned the prisoners, stating that the strike is a "spontaneous" reaction to the economic difficulties of Egypt and the confusion of financial policy. The CFJ underlines the need for a constructive dialogue and realistic solutions to deal with the legitimate requests of workers, instead of resorting to repression and intimidation. [...]

</p>
<p>
   In addition to suffering the pressures of the masses for the vile response of the Egyptian regime to the ruthless attacks by the Israeli state in Gaza, the president "strong man" Sisi has to face the growing anger of the workers. The dizzying increase in food prices hardly affected Egyptian low -salary workers, but there are signs of a resumption of struggle.
  </p>
<p>
   About 14,000 textile workers in the largest Egyptian factory, the Misr Spin-think and weiving Company, in Mahalla Al-Kubra, in the region of the Nile delta, started a week of strike on February 22. The workers of one of the major branches of the real estate company Talaat Moustafa Group, Alexan-Dria Construction, in Cairo, protested on February 28th.
  </p>
<p>
   It was the workers of the Mahalla clothing factory that started to mark the slogans that quickly spread from one building to another. The safety personnel blocked the exits to prevent these workers, as well as those of the on -site power plant, gathered in the central square. However, on the third day, 7,000 strikers gathered there. Dozens of people have been arrested. As usual, the official trade union committee managed by the state denounced the strike, but the workers kicked them off the event.
  </p>
<p>
   This event echoes the historic strike of 2006, when Mahalla's women began the strike that was a fundamental step towards the 2011 revolt that ended the 31 years of government of President Hosni Mubarak. In 2008, the city witnessed a revolt that would have repeated himself on a national scale three years later.
  </p>
<p>
   [...] The strike ended after a week, following the intervention of the Minister of the Public Sector. The management agreed to pay a minimum of 6,000 per month and most of the arrested workers were released. A previous offer, which included the payment of extraordinary, participation in profits and health insurance, was not accepted.
  </p>
<p>
   Protest of construction workers
  </p>
<p>
   Hundreds of workers from Talaat Moustafa protested in front of the company headquarters. The company has fired workers with permanent contracts and replaced them with temporary workers at worst conditions. The workers asked for backward payments, a bonus for the cost of living, a better health insurance and safety devices on construction sites.
  </p>
<p>
   The conditions of the construction sites are bad, there are no security devices and health coverage is insufficient. Many dismissed workers have been injured at work or suffer from chronic diseases.
  </p>
<p>
   The workers reported to journalists that the criteria for bonuses and increases are obscure, but are constantly provided to people related or connected to the managers. The managers and their assistants receive sumptuous benefits, while workers' salaries remain low.
  </p>
<p>
   Unusually, the police did not try to block the protest, even if in the past he stopped smaller protests. However, on March 4, a protest of the offices of the offices was prevented when the security forces blocked the gates.
  </p>
<p>
   But then hundreds of company security guards refused to start their turn! They asked for higher wages, best benefits, working hours and holidays. “Our salaries are very low, equal to 3,000 le. We work for over 14 hours a day, unlike the rest of the employees. We receive the quarterly bonus at a lower percentage than them, "explained a guard.
  </p>
<p>
   Within 30 minutes, a high manager met them, promising to pay an increase within two months, after which the protest ended.
  </p>
<p>
   Mubarak's regime remains
  </p>
<p>
   The Talaat Moustafa group had enormous contracts for the construction of the new capital that President Sisi supervised. Over the past year, he has tripled his activities in the real estate and hospitality sector, despite the economic crisis of Egypt. In recent months, the price of his actions has risen, gaining millions of dollars to his multimilionary main shareholder, Talaat Moustafa. One of the richest men in Africa was close to Hosni's son Mubarak, Gamal, hated by workers for pushing a vast privatization when the father was president.
  </p>
<p>
   In 2008, Talaat Moustafa was recognized guilty of having paid 2 million dollars to a former policeman to kill the Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim. The other main shareholders of the Talaat Moustafa group are the Bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.
  </p>
<p>
   In February, the company concluded a partnership agreement with the investment company of the United Ame Arab Emirates for the construction of a new and vast tourist city in Ras El-Hikma, on the Mediterranean coast, west of Alexandria. The 35 billion dollar operation, including the sale of land by the army, will greatly help the government of Sisi to pay the 42 billion dollars of debts and the interest it will have to pay this year. There are many questions raised, including the feasibility of the project, its environmental cost, the true value of the land, how to have the ownership of the army, what is the opinion of the local residents (who have not been consulted) e What checks will be on future profits in a "free economic area".
  </p>
<p>
   The desperate need for foreign currency of the Sisi government forced him to sell assets owned by the state. Ras El-Hikma adds to the growing list of Egyptian companies and land now under the property and control of the Gulf.
  </p>
<p>
   The serious inequalities, corruption and brutal repression of the opposition of the regime of the former president Hosni Mubarak have continued, and even increased, under Sisi. Recent strikes and workers' protests could mark the beginning of a new wave of actions of the working class, such as the one developed in the last years of Mubarak.
  </p>
<p>
   The awakening of the Egyptian working class could be a powerful factor to end the Gaza crisis, open the Rafah's pass to humanitarian aid and encourage workers and the poor of the whole Middle East and North Africa to dirty their mega-round rulers throughout the region.
  </p>
<p>
   To end capitalist poverty, war and destruction of the environment, it is necessary to build independent unions and workers' parties with socialist, democratic and internationalist programs.

  At least five collecting lawsuits in various provinces of Canada are currently running against both doctors and the Canadian government due to the forced sterilization of indigenous women.
  <a href="/index.php/de/t-proletarischer-feminismus/7939-zwangssterilisationen-in-den-usa">
   Similar to the United States
  </a>
  Also grew in Canada the "Eugeniker" movement at the beginning of the 20th century, which openly explained to "control" the indigenous population by means of an infertility.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   The provinces of Alberta and British Columbia operated in the 20th century by the Eugeniker movement, sterilization programs initiated,
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   which, together with the "Indian Act" - a racist and still applicable law, that the indigenous people, the "first nations", grants significantly less rights than the "white" and for them provides for them -

<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   suppress the development of the indigenous population

  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   .
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   From the 1960s to the 1980s, the birth rate of the indigenous people in Canada fell from 47 to 28 percent.
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   The abolition of Eugenik laws began in the 1970s, but the increasing complaints and investigations of the past few years have shown that
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   that forced sterilization is still a common remedy for Canadian imperialism, ethnic purges compared to the almost five percent of the total population of Canada
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   to take.
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   L
  </span>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   On the bourgeois politician
  </span>
  Yvonne Boyer has had at least 12,000 cases of compulsory sterilizations in Canada since the 1970s - often women were ignorant about it over a long time:
  <em>
   “For example, we were not yet in the north. We know: 26 percent of women in iglooic were sterilized. They brought them south with ships, made mass sterilizations and brought them back. ”
  </em>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   Boyer is not the only bourgeois politician who the topic
  </span>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   picks up for their purposes - even the Senate, at least after after

<span style="font-style: normal;">
   The crimes against the indigenous women continue to take place
  </span>

   This genocide sheds light on the intertwining between nationalist militarism 
 Israeli, the complicity of the United States, the experimentation of weapons 
 lethal and geopolitical objectives, which all converge towards the 
 objectives of a prolonged war, colonial expansion and 
 systematic eradication of the Palestinians. In particular, reveals the 
 measure that Israel's existence and function itself, such as 
 colonial training
   <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
   of settlement, is organically linked to a 
 expansive military-industrial complex that has shaped 
 basically his society and culture, the economy, the relationships of 
 foreign policy and external support.
   <br/>
<br/>
   The Foundation of Israel in 1948 laid the foundations for the development of a 
  vast military-industrial complex, intricate in its structures 
 economic, social and political, which extends beyond the traditional 
 scope of defense operations. This complex system incorporates 
 a wide range of capacity, including the production of advanced weapons, lo 
 development of double use technologies, innovations in the field of 
 private safety, strategic capital investments and 
 elaborate export-self-employment strategies. In addition, it offers vast 
 job opportunities in the public and private sectors.
   <span>
</span>
<br/>
   A series of different actors guides this militarized matrix, 
 expanding its impact beyond the boundaries of military domains and 
 safety, to include various financial actors. These include 
 investors, contractors and technological companies, Jewish capital, 
 especially those from the military and finance sector 
 American. The influence of Israel's military-economic initiatives 
 permeates even non -military sectors, establishing collaborations with 
 academic institutions, health organizations, unions and communities 
 scientific research.
   <br/>
<br/>
   This fusion of military objectives with civil life has favored one 
 perfect integration of military and economic interests in the 
 Israeli society. The result is a vast and interconnected network in which 
  The programs of the military-economic entities are profoundly 
 rooted in the Zionist Ethos, influencing a broad spectrum of processes 
 social and political.
   <br/>
<br/>
   This document aims to highlight four fundamental pillars that 
 They feed the expansion of the military-industrial complex of Israel.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Hyper-nationalistic militarism
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   Israel's founding ethos is deeply intertwined with the 
 militarism and nationalism, creating a distinctive militarized pact 
  between the state and its citizens. This bond is considerably more 
 pronounced compared to other nations that emerged after the second war 
 world, with the Israeli army that occupies a central role not 
 Only in the safety sectors, but which extends its influence to 
 Economic, social and cultural spheres. This nuance of the boundaries between 
 Military and civil sector challenges conventional theoretical expectations 
 civil-military separation of distinct roles and identities.
   <br/>
<br/>
   In Israel, the army is not only an entity of defense, but acts as 
 cardinal institution for integration and social commitment, influencing 
  a wide range of aspects of society, including education, i 
 judicial processes, media, economic initiatives and assimilation 
  of Jewish immigrants. As described by Baruch Kimmerling, the army is 
  the "central organizational principle" that binds the social fabric, 
 shaping the identity and collective values [2]. This militarism 
 pervasive is not only a transitory phase, but a belief 
 deeply rooted in the majority of Israeli Jews, who 
 indicates militarism as a fundamental ideology [3]. It is not surprising 
 that Israel is the most militarized nation in the world [4].
   <br/>
<br/>
   In Israel, the intertwining of militarism with education and the world 
 academic is profound, with the educational institutions that promote rules 
  militarists from an early age. This is evident in the way in which the 
  University are actively engaged in the development of technologies 
 military and in cultivating talents intended for the defense sector. 
 Elite programs like Talpiot and Havatzalot exemplify this 
 I wait, by equipping the students of the skills necessary to hold 
 roles in military and safety -oriented technological companies, 
 thus supporting the nation's war economy.
   <br/>
<br/>
   The Israeli High-Tech sector, strongly influenced by incubators 
  of military innovation, is a milestone of the national economy, 
 contributing to 18.1% of GDP and using about 14% of the force 
 work [5]. The growth of this sector is significantly pushed 
 from synergies with the army, through government contracts, 
 cooperation and investments initiatives attracted by the skills of 
 Double use of technologies. Such collaborations have favored a 
 dynamic high-tech ecosystem, rich in growing startups and companies 
  military and safety.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Military patronage of the United States
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   The relationship between the United States and Israel is basically 
 characterized by a patron-client framework, in which Israel yes 
 aligned with the strategic objectives of the United States in the Middle East in 
 change of substantial economic, military and diplomatic support, 
 establishing a reciprocal sub-imperial control.
   <br/>
<br br=""/>
<br/>
   A congress report underlines the transformative impact of this 
 assistance on the Israeli armed forces, without which the arsenal 
 Advanced military of Israel would be unattainable [6]. At the basis of 
 This support is the commitment of the United States to preserve the 
 qualitative military advantage (Qualitative Military Edge, QME) of 
 Israel compared to regional opponents, guaranteeing its continuous 
 military pre -finance.
   <br/>
<br/>
   The strategic partnership between the United States and Israel was started 
 moment of the foundation of Israel in 1948, but were the 
 geopolitical changes following the 1967 war to intensify 
 significantly their alliance. Recognizing Israel as a 
 critical bulwark against the rise of panorabism and influence 
 Soviet, the Nixon administration increased the support of the States 
 United, as shown by the dramatic increase in military aid from 360 
 millions of dollars in 1968 at approximately $ 2.2 billion in 1973, 
 marking an increase of 800% to the threshold of the Arab-Israeli war.
   <br/>
<br/>
   The report has further consolidated under the administration 
 Reagan, who designated Israel as an "important non-senior ally", one 
  move that has strengthened military and technological cooperation between 
 Two nations. This era was characterized by significant investments 
  of the United States in Israel's defense skills through efforts 
  of collaborative research and development, which led to integration 
  and to the dependence of Israel on US military technology. 
 This dependence is highlighted by significant defense projects such as 
  The Arrow Missilistic System, the Lavi Jet, the Merkava tank e 
 the Iron Dome system, which include American components or have been 
 developed jointly with a substantial financial contribution 
 American.
   <br/>
<br/>
   In 2016, the Obama administration raised the military assistance of 
  United states at a new level, thanks to an agreement that has increased the 
  annual aid package to Israel of 3.1 billion dollars a 
 3.8 billion dollars for the years 2019-2028, for a total of 38 
 billions of dollars, which represents the commitment of military aid 
 Bilateral more consistent in the history of the United States. This 
 Agreement represents more than 20% of the Israel defense budget.
   <br/>
<br/>
   The profound dependence on American military technology has shaped 
 significantly the competitive advantage of defense companies 
 Israeli, positioning them mainly as subcontractors in the 
 production of specialized components for US systems. 
 These include progress in GPS and navigation, simulations 
  training, optical technologies and cybersecurity measures. 
 This dynamic underlines a report in which the contractors of the 
 US defense largely establish the terms of the commitment, 
 illustrating the role of Israel as a subordinate participant 
 within the large US military-industrial complex.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    Palestine as a laboratory
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   Israel has established itself as an important developer and distributor of 
  advanced military technologies, exploiting its operational experiences a 
 Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon and Syria to market his 
 products such as "tested in battle". This denomination implies for 
 these technologies the fact that you have proven effective through 
 effective use in combat. However, the reality below is that 
 This effectiveness is often demonstrated through the use of these 
 technologies in highly brutal actions against populations largely 
 civilians [7].
   <br/>
<br/>
   Remote piloted aircraft (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAV), or 
 drones, they are a cornerstone of the Israeli war economy; The 
 Country is a dominant force in drones technology, with over 60% 
  of world exports in 2017 [8].
   <br/>
<br/>
   The progress and improvement of Israeli's technology technology 
  are significantly influenced by their operational use in 
 Palestinian territories. Drones have become a fixed point in 
 military operations of Israel, offering persistent surveillance on 
  Gaza. The use of drones in the wars against Gaza is brutal and aggressive, 
 leading to a series of targeted assaults, missile attacks and 
 Extraguditial kills. These operations caused the 
 Loss of civil lives and the widespread destruction of infrastructure 
 civilians.
   <br/>
<br/>
   Gaza has a dual purpose in the framework of the military-industrial complex 
 Israeli, transforming the acts of colonial aggression into 
 OPPORTUNITY TEST AND COMMERCIAL TEST OPPORTUNITIES. On the one hand, Gaza 
  It emerged as an open -air laboratory for war with drones, 
 laying the foundations for the biopolitical experimentation of new technologies 
 lethal. This situation throws a dark shadow on the commodification of 
 These technologies, rooted in practices that have nothing to do with 
  The "military necessity", but rather with a real cruelty. 
 On the other hand, Gaza provides a real scenario for defense companies 
 Israeli to show their technological progress, transforming of 
 made the besieged strip in hardware marketing platforms 
 military [9].
   <br/>
<br/>
   In every Israeli military offensive against Gaza from 2008 to 2023, i 
 Droni were central to the strategy. Models like Elbit Hermes 
 Systems and Heron Etan of Israeli Aerospace Industries, equipped with 
 advanced features such as self -targeted spike missiles, have been 
 fundamental for these attacks. Each offensive of Gaza has acted 
 like a test bench and a development platform for these drones, 
 leading to their improvement and commercial sale.
   <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
    The trade of weapons as a normalization tool
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   In recent years, Israel has positioned itself as a significant actor 
  in the global weapon market, with 70% -80% of its production 
 military directed to international customers. This aspect of trade is 
  Fundamental for Israel, as weapons exports 
 constitute about 25% of its total export income 
 industrial, demonstrating the vital importance of military sales 
 in its economic and commercial strategies. In the period from 2014 to 
 2018, Israel was classified as the eighth supplier of weapons a 
 global level, contributing to 3.1% of the world trade of weapons 
 [10].
   <br/>
<br/>
   Sales of Israeli weapons have recorded strong growth, 
 especially following the Abraham agreements of 2020, who opened 
  Opportunities in the new markets of the Arab States. In this period, the 
 Israeli military exports have reached levels without 
 previous, with a turnover of $ 11.3 billion in 2021 e 
 a further rise to 12.5 billion dollars in 2022, of which one 
 significant part has been attributed to sales in Arab countries 
 [11].
   <br/>
<br/>
   However, the importance of Israel's arms exports goes beyond 
  mere financial gain; they play a crucial role in his 
 international strategic positioning and in its foreign policy. 
 Defined "diplomacy of arms", Israel uses the sale of weapons for 
  achieve two main objectives: encourage normalization 
 relationships and strengthen alliances.
   <br/>
<br/>
   First of all, weapons exports are needed to Israel as via 
 strategic to expand its global diplomatic imprint, in 
 particular with the nations that historically abstained from 
 establish formal diplomatic relationships. A recent example of this 
 strategic use of military exports is the deepening of 
 links between Israel and some Arab States of the Gulf, a relationship that is 
 passed from secret interactions to formal alliances with the agreements of 
 Abraham. These agreements have facilitated a level of cooperation 
 Unprecedented military and security, with Israel who transferred 
 military and safety technologies for a value of about 3 billion 
 dollars to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrein [12]. This development 
 marks a significant realignment in the geopolitical panorama 
 Middle Eastern, with Israel exploiting his defense skills for 
 create diplomatic connections and extend its influence in 
 region.
   <br/>

<strong>
    Conclusion
   </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
   The genocidal events in Gaza serve to remember the rooted cycle of 
 Violence and intrinsic oppression to the Israeli colonial project. 
 The latter assault is not an isolated accident, but rather 
 emblematic of a historical continuum dating back to the 1948 Nakba and that 
  has perpetuated in the following decades of conflict and hostility against 
 The Palestinian population. At the basis of this model of aggression 
 There is the crucial role played by the military-industrial complex of 
 Israel, a multifaceted apparatus that not only allows, but draws 
 actively profit from the perpetuation of colonialism of 
 settlement.
   <br/>
<br/>
   The vast implications of the military-industrial complex 
 Israeli extend well beyond the immediate context of Palestine. 
  Its destabilizing impact places serious threats to the Region and the 
 peace and world security, and basically challenges the principles of 
 self -determination and justice sanctioned by international law. 
 As such, the response of the international community to colonialism of 
 Israeli settlement and the mechanisms with which it exercises 
 Oppression and war requires urgent multilateral action e 
 coordinated to impose boycott, divestment and sanctions 
  against Israel.

  Hereby we publish an unofficial translation of
  <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/oaxaca-sin-agua-sequia-o-saqueo/">
   an article
  </a>
  found in the Mexican website Periódico Mural.
 </p>
<p>
  During the last few months, more than 4,326 hectares of land were affected by terrible forest fires caused by the latifundium or surged as a phenomenon during the dry season. Additionally in various regions of Oaxaca such as the Valles Centrales, Mixteca and Costa, mainly, has been seen a water crisis that threatens entire populations, and now also public hospitals and schools.
 </p>
<p>
  The clear example is the situation of the General Hospital “Dr. Aurelio Valdivieso”, in the Oaxacan capital’s center, which on 22
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of February suspend work after running out of water. Obviously a hospital cannot function without providing minimum health conditions for patients and medical staff, and therefore the drinking water service is essential. In this regard, the Defender of Human Rights of the Oaxaca’s People began a precedents notebook and issued precautionary measures requesting
  <em>
   “comprehensive actions from the State
  </em>
<em>
   in order to
  </em>
<em>
   avoid causing damage that is difficult or impossible to repair
  </em>
<em>
   in
  </em>
<em>
   detriment of citizens’ right to health.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Now, in the same capital of the entity, it is reported that at least 6 public schools had to suspend work and return to online classes due to the total shortage of water in their facilities. The most recent have been the “Carlos A. Carrillo” Urban Morning Primary School, located in Colonia Reforma, and the “Enrique Pestalozzi” Morning Primary School, located in the City’s Center. Leaving children without access to drinking water within their schools also violates their right to education and health, among others contemplated within the best interests of children.
 </p>
<p>
  Until a few weeks ago, the shortage of drinking water was concentrated in the popular neighborhoods generally located on the periphery and hills of the city, nothing new. For decades there have been dozens of neighborhoods called “illegal settlements” where poor people do not have access to drinking water or other public services; hundreds of small schools are in the same situation in those same neighborhoods. The different governments in power have systematically ignored this situation, leaving the solution in the hands of the residents who have had to hire private pipes which take advantage of the dry season to speculate on water prices.
 </p>
<p>
  But now that the water crisis has reached the central area of the City and the “good” neighborhoods such as Reforma, San Felipe, etc. the situation has become a scandal; even more so when visible public institutions such as the General Hospital and the before mentioned schools had to suspend work due to the water shortage.

</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, in Oaxaca, soft drink companies and brewery companies continue to work normally, as do large hotels, restaurants, vice-centers and even spas that are preparing for Holy Week and beautiful tourism. None of these have a lack of water at all.
 </p>
<p>
  Are we facing a phenomenon of drought or looting? You can answer.
 </p>
<p>
  If during the pandemic a health emergency and suspension of work was declared for these industries and businesses, the same should be done in the midst of this water crisis, which is also a health crisis, besides to regulating the price of water sold by pipers organized in union mafias.
 </p>
<p>
  Guaranteeing universal access to drinking water as a fundamental right is a vital necessity and not the upcoming elections. The money spent on campaigns and candidates should be invested in community water collection and supply systems for the people.

<strong>
   Imperialism spreads out its claws
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The imperialist boots, of a different stripe, invade Ecuador, hunting for our land, natural resources, cheap labor, market (mainly arms), colluding and struggling for the distribution of the world. In Ecuador we face the expansion of the extractive mining monopoly.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialism, through transnational mining companies, spits out their narratives like poison, they say that they come with progress, sources of employment, industrialization, wealth, among other fallacies. The viper has little or no interest in the well-being of the oppressed peoples, on the contrary, their colonizing practices and their desire to get rich at any cost are obvious.
 </p>
<p>
  Those paper tigers want to break into Ecuador because the labor rights are violated and thus satiate themselves with other people’s work. So, mining companies are guaranteed cheap labor with relations of semi-feudal production. The bourgeois/landlord government of Noboa is going further beyond being a representative of the big comprador bourgeois faction, it is the incarnation of feudalism, a big landlord raised in the image and likeness of the Yankees to reproduce feudality, gamonalism, servitude, unpaid labor and semi-coloniality.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   INVASION OF PALO BURMADO-LAS PAMPAS
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The governments in power, since the fascist Correa, passing through Moreno, Lasso and today the big landlord of Noboa, together with other institutions of the old state, have bowed their heads before their imperialist masters. They have provided all the conditions for them to dispossess the lands of the peasant.
 </p>
<p>
  What is happening in Palo Quemado-Las Pampas of Sigchos, Cotopaxi province, is nothing more than the imperialist imposition of bureaucratic capitalism (semi-colonial/semi-feudal), they granted concessions of 2,200 hectares of Palo Quemado and Las Pampas in favor of the mining company La Plata SA, owned by Atico Mining Corporation SA, now it enters in the peasant communities with the aim of concentrating the land, exploiting minerals such as gold, silver, copper, among others.
 </p>
<p>
  Bureaucrats of the Ministry of the Environment and employees of the La Plata SA mining company have taken the task of carrying out mediocre workshops and socialization talks, distracting from the true social and environmental impact, offering sources of work, training, vaccines for children, education, trucks and machinery, simply trying to buy consciences. They do it in front of a few clueless and traitorous residents, under the pretext of a supposed socialization of the mining project, with that mechanism they enter the people to divide and oppose them.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Anti-imperialist resistance
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The old state activated its repressive apparatus on March 19 and 20, members of the National Police and Armed Forces, according to complaints from community members, in coordination with paramilitary mafias at the service of imperialism and power groups, attacked the peasantry. Furthermore, the State Attorney General’s Office criminalized the right to resist and protest, prosecuting around 72 community members, unusually, for the crime of terrorism.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite all the repression and persecution, the brave masses have resisted belligerently, the peasants carry out struggles to expel the invader, they burned two vehicles of imperialist lackeys and injured six police and military personnel.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Down with consultations and bourgeois/big landlord institutionality
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The farce of the previous, free and informed consults, popular elections, elections and spurious bourgeois democracy is developed. For example, the popular consultation for not exploiting the Yasuní ITT, what use has it been? What is the utility of electing an executioner as president every four years? The mining socializations in the Las Naves canton, what they were useful for? They only serve to numb popular struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  The traitors, revisionists, reformists and opportunists try to take the people’s struggle to the abyss, leading the masses into the electoral and institutional abyss, pushing them towards prior, free and informed consultation, which is rigged in favor of imperialist mining, that legitimize the invasion and becomes the extinguisher of the sparks of resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  We should not romanticize the struggle of oppressed peoples, this goes beyond water, nature, nor is an issue for indigenous people, mixed races, blacks or whites. Let’s open our eyes, the world is going through several imperialist invasions against oppressed peoples.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialism wants to take over our main means of production, the land and everything it contains, expelling our peasants from their lands. So, the people of Palo Quemado-Las Pampas, their main contradiction is against imperialism, against semi-feudality and against bureaucratic capitalism, in that order.
 </p>
<p>
  We cannot trust anything from the institutions of the old state, they are all at the service of imperialism and the groups in power, not even the Armed Forces and National Police that point their weapons at the poorest in the country for the benefit of the exploiter. And they will not hesitate to pull the trigger. On the other hand, there is the proletariat, the poor peasants, the democratic intellectuals, the brave people, who undertake the anti-imperialist struggle for the land.

 Every year on March 25, urban propaganda tries to inflate the minds of youth and the people with grandeurs tied up with religious "uplifting" (unity of nation and church), liar narratives and nationalist priests. It is therefore necessary, political and social spaces like the "crack", who want to be placed with the side of the people, their own history and its revolutionary traditions, to take response initiatives throughout this bombardment.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  The choice of presentation of the book "200+1 Years later" was moved in this direction, this purpose sought to satisfy and eventually - from the result - was justified.
 </p>
<p>
  The presentation took place at the "Two" bookstore on Friday, March 22. The short but very essential "opening" of the event was made by SYN. Sissy Panidou, and then - one of the two - writer Dimitris Manos, made a detailed and cohesive analysis of the characteristics and peculiarities of the Greek Revolution of 1821, the social groups that took part in it and the role of the Great Powers.
 </p>
<p>
  The suggestion created the ground for a rich debate, but it was unable to evolve in its entire range due to limited time by the bookstore, and also passed today and the needs of the barbarism of the system and its attack on its wide layers. Today's Greek society. Perhaps the most important contribution of the presentation was that he gave birth to more study and discussion, both to youth and older, which was also reflected in book sales.

  This last week new clashes have erupted between the old Indian State and the peasants. The struggle of these last ones, far away from being a specific phenomenon in Punjab-Haryana, is a constant struggle in the whole country, between the peasantry and the old bureaucratic-big landlord Indian State. In the last weeks, there are news of the peasant struggle in many places of the country.

  the peasants made a mass protest to interrupt the railway traffic in the country, affecting Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana. The protests were made in at least 95 places in Punjab and another three places in Haryana. In all, 49 trains were affected, 9 of them being canceled. Other many trains made shortened ways. This affected not only the regional or intercity routes, but also the main transport routes. People were detained in Haryana and Rajasthan.

  it was clearly seen how the peasant protests are not a specific phenomenon but something usual also in other parts of India. In this occasion the peasantry protested in Byadgi, Karnataka, state of Mysore. The peasants protested there due to the low prices of some of the crops, mainly chili. The buying price of this product in the local markets had decreased by almost 50% from one day to another. The peasants protested and attacked the office of the Agricultural Production Market Committee (APMC), setting it ablaze, as well as police vehicles and they pushed back the intervention by the repressive forces.

<p>
  The last news of a clash between the Indian peasantry and the old State has occurred in the Buxar district, Bihar. On

  </a>
  the peasants of the area protested against the construction of a thermic energy plant. The peasants protested against the lack of economical compensation after the confiscation of their lands, as well as for the lack of alternatives of employment. The police brutally charged against the protesters, and this is clearly seen in the recordings of the scene and this has upset the whole local population. The peasants bravely resisted and it is reported that there are more than 20 police officers injured, as well as 30 peasants been detained.
 </p>
<p>
  While the imperialists mass media mainly focuses in the farmer’s and peasants protests in Europe, the peasant struggle in India and other oppressed countries is being ignored, and often hidden. However this struggle has a fundamental character and is sharpening in all the semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries, as the struggle of the peasantry against the latifundium, monopolies and the bureaucratic-big landlord states is key for the liberation of the peoples of the world and the struggle against imperialism.

It should be noted that Haiti has a population of 11 million people, that means that almost half of the country is in serious trouble to eat properly. These figures are not a direct consequence of the current Haitian situation, but are part of the structural poverty of Haiti, a direct consequence of its condition as a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country, oppressed by imperialism, mainly by the yoke of Yankee imperialism, which has a long history of interventions in the country. The next intervention is already going on and recently the United States’ Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has announced that the

  Imperialist interventions have been frequent during Haiti’s history. Its subjugation and its condition as an oppressed country is evident. The Haitian economy has been in debt since the beginning of its history as a State. After formal independence from the French empire beginning in 1804 when Haitian slaves expelled the French colonizers, these used a war fleet

  the relationship of subjugation of Haiti towards American interests started, with the entry of Yankee financial capital on the island.

   In 1915
  </a>
  the US militarily occupied the island, keeping the troops in Haiti for 19 years. From that moment onward, the Yankees controlled the island’s budget directly until 1947, to ensure that Haiti would pay a new debt, this time acquired by the United States. Until that year Haiti used half of its Gross Domestic Product to pay its debts to France and the United States. During direct Yankee control, policies of social cuts were applied and the looting of the country began, sinking it into even deeper poverty than what they suffered from payments to their former French masters.

After this, serious attacks were carried out against the people that reduced a lot their democratic rights and their access to basic services such as education, health, food, etc. These deficiencies are still very present today and largely explain the vulnerability of the Haitian people facing any type of health crisis, natural crisis or any other type of crisis. To ensure the subjugation of the Haitian people to the interests of Yankee imperialism, a terrible regime led by its lackeys was established, first François “Papa Doc” Duvalier, and later his son Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier. A fact that may seem an anecdote, but that serves as an example of this total subjugation to Yankee imperialism, is that in the 70s

   Haiti became the largest producer of baseballs in the world
  </a>
  , exporting 20 million balls a year. Yankee imperialism supported a brutal dictatorship that, under the command of “Papa Doc” Duvalier, saw the birth of a paramilitary force of 60,000 soldiers, known as “Tonton Macoute”, which terrorized and repressed the people as much as was necessary to keep the interests of the ruling classes and Yankee imperialism intact. With the fall of “Baby Doc” Duvalier in 1986 at the hands of a popular revolt, many of the paramilitary leaders were executed by the people.

  After this revolt, Yankee imperialism maneuvered to maintain its dominance over the oppressed country.

  being first rejected by Yankee imperialism but later accepted. This president applied harsh anti-popular measures in his first term and was established in power directly by Yankee troops (more than 20,000 soldiers), who were directly occupying the country from 1994 to 2000. Aristide, in his second term from 2001 to 2004 he applied new harsh measures against the people. Masses rose up against

   these measures demanded by the IMF
  </a>
  , i.e. Yankee imperialism, which Aristide was applying and the lackey of Yankee imperialism was overthrown in 2004. The bourgeois media described his overthrow as a coup d’état and an intervention by gangs and criminals. After this revolt, Yankee imperialism once again militarily occupied the country along with troops of its lackeys. After this first direct occupation from Yankee troops, then came the troops of the so-called “peacekeeping” or blue helmets from the UN, among which the Brazilian troops and other lackeys of Yankee imperialism
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/07/haiti-foreign-intervention-history-peacekeeper/">
   portrayed an infamous role
  </a>
  . There were numerous massacres against the Haitian people, even diseases were intentionally spread against the people, such as the use of cholera spread by Prachanda’s Nepalese troops.

   The newspaper AND pointed out
  </a>
  how the Brazilian repressive forces committed crimes against the Haitian people and learned how to apply their terrorist methods against the Brazilian people, especially how to apply new repressive methods in the favelas. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) was present in the country until 2017.

  The interests of Yankee financial capital have continued to be present in Haiti. In 2021 instability grew again in the Caribbean country when President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by Colombian mercenaries,

   trained and financed within the framework of “Plan Colombia”
  </a>
  , financed by Yankee imperialism as part of its terror plan against the Colombian people and their revolts against the old State. Additionally Yankee imperialism was able to take advantage of these mercenaries for other destabilization plans, as was the case in Haiti. In this way, it was possible to perpetuate instability in the country, eliminate an obstacle to centralize and corporatize power even more, and thus to be able to deal with the growing protests and popular revolts in the country, which could put at risk the status quo of subjugation to Yankee imperialism. Ariel Henry laid the first stone,

   asking in 2022 for “help”
  </a>
  and police intervention to fight the gangs in Haiti. Subsequently, Yankee imperialism has prepared the future intervention that will take place in the country. The intervention that is being proposed will not be carried out directly by Yankee imperialism but they will rather use its lackeys for this purpose, just as was done with MINUSTAH. In this case Kenya will have a center role by sending thousands of police officers, and other countries such as Benin, Bangladesh, Chad, Barbados, Belize and Antigua and Barbuda have pledged that they will send troops.

   The President of Kenya, William Ruto, has remained faithful to Yankee imperialism
  </a>
  and has said that he will send the repressive forces when there is a government established in Haiti, that is, when the Transitional Council will be functioning. For this reason, Yankee imperialism has finally set up its plan of military occupation of Haiti: first Ariel Henry had to resign, then the new government or provisional authority has to be formed, and after that it would have legitimacy within the framework of bourgeois law, to receive the occupying troops at the service of Yankee imperialism. The next step will be the election of a new central authority, which will willingly accept to welcome the occupiers and serve to the Yankee interests.

  Haiti’s history is an example of the struggle of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world against imperialism and an example of the countless crimes and atrocities committed by imperialism. It is an example of how the imperialists have treated and treat those who have rebelled, those who have dared to fight and win. It is an example of how the Haitian people have been struggling against Yankee imperialism throughout the 20
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  century and the beginning of the 21
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  century, and how the emergence of the paramilitaries, the misery suffered by the masses and the total absence of social services, all of them are direct consequences of the role of imperialism and its local lackeys in the country.
