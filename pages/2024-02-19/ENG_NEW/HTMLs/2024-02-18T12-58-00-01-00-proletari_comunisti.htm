   The first to arrive were they: the 
 Women in black of Verona. Also this year they found themselves on time 
  at the opening of the Fair gates. Silent, behind the 
 gate and big signs in hand where they read written as «the 
 diffusion of weapons does not increase our safety "," we already have 
 Giulietta and Romeo, we do not need guns "," teaching to love and not a 
 shoot". Mostly ignored signs by the crowd of visitors who, 
 Since the first morning, he has been crowded at the entrance of Eos, acronym 
 For European Outdoor Show.

   <strong>
    The new guise
   </strong>
   of the traditional weapon fair 
 of Verona, after a long negotiation with pacifist associations and the 
 Common, has agreed to lower the tones and camouflage itself into one 
 exhibition dedicated to hunting, shooting and fishing, removing the 
 contested term "personal defense weapons". As if in our country, 
  in which all semi -automatic weapons are considered guning weapons, there 
  It was a distinction between a "sporting" gun and a defense.
  </p>
  <p>
   Just the "camouflage" of what remains a mere anyway 
 exposure of weapons, was considered unacceptable by the network 
 Veronese for Palestine, considering that among the approximately 300 exhibitors

  They also appear Israeli companies or in any case companies that provide weapons 
  to Israel, as well as to many other nations that do not shine for the 
 Defense of human rights. “Weapons are exposed to this fair that 
 They are used to repress dissent - explains Mackda Ghebremariam 
 Tesfau ', activist for the rights of the Palestinians - to exhibit their 
 Death products include the major weapons of the world, 
 Because those who sell hunting, shooting and sports weapons, defense 
 personnel, also equips the armies, which bring horror and 
 destruction through permanent global war. War falling 
  As always on the civilian population, as is happening in Gaza ».
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   About a thousand activists and activists accepted the appeal 
 of the Association and gathered behind the large banner «Stop al 
 genocide. We disarm Israel ». From Piazza della Fiera, the procession has 
 marched around the exhibition venue to conclude in front of the gates 
  entry where some scuffles occurred with the forces of 
 police who have not spared the batons. In the end i 
 Protesters, however, managed to exhibit a Pro Gaza banner 
 In front of the entrance and remained in the evening to shout slogan against 
 Israel and the war industries.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    Among the members
   </strong>
   to the event, associations 
 For rights, for disarmament, social centers, parties such as the Greens, 
 Left and re -foundation and also many animalistic organizations that 
 Of course they will not have liked the statements of the regional councilor 
 Veneto to sport, Cristiano Corazzari, who from the inside 
 of the exhibition remarked the fundamental role of the hunters, a 
 his saying, authentic environmentalists "who in perfect agreement with the 
 Region play a fundamental role in the environmental management of 
 territory to the fullest of the community ». Remarking below how 
  «People who are in here is the best because they are people who respect the 
  rules".

   Maybe, the commissioner did not refer to compliance with the ethical code - 
 a novelty of this year expressly desired by the Municipality - who asked 
 to the exhibitors not to put the weapons in the hands of children. Disposition 
 also supported by the Police Headquarters but which has been completely disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
   Giorgio Beretta, author of the book
   <em>
    The country of arms
   </em>
   (Other economics), he tweeted from inside the fair: «But the police station is 
 checking that its provision on the preload to minors of 
 handle weapons is applied? I saw many children with weapons in 
 hand with lots of images - with a darkened face - of children playing with 
  bigger rifles of them ».
  </p>
  <p>
   "How much hypocrisy! Do you think that at the wine fair entry to minors 
  It is rightly forbidden. Here, on the other hand, is even free! », He has me 
 a lady whispered with a sign written in her hand: «Also the 
 Weapons held legally killing women ».
