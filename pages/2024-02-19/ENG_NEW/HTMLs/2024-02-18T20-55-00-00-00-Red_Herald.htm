  The State of Israel, supported by imperialism, mainly Yankee, continues to carry out its genocide against the Palestinian people. Today it is

 <p>
  Meanwhile, imperialism, mainly Yankee, continue to support the Zionist aggression while hypocritically announce their concern or conversations with Netanyahu for the disproportionate use of force or due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The reality is that Yankee imperialism

  The National Resistance Front of Palestine
  <a href="https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/israeli-military-sites--settlements-under-gaza-resistance-s">
   continues to fight fiercely against the Zionist occupation in Gaza
  </a>
  . Actions against the supply lines of the Israeli army are reported in Khan Younis by the al-Quds brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, by the Al-Mujahideen brigades, and by the Martyr’s Brigades of Al-Aqsa. Objectives in Israeli cities such as Ashkelon have also been hit.

  The Arab lackeys of Yankee imperialism are providing help to the State of Israel and collaborating with the repression of the solidarity movement with the Palestinian people. The Jordanian people continue to protest and block the communications and supplies to the State of Israel from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that cross Jordan towards the territory occupied by the State of Israel.

  The Jordanian State
  <a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/jordanians-form-human-chain-block-trucks-israel">
   has sent its troops and has avoided blockages

  , isolating the protesters and dispersing them several times, thus fulfilling a fundamental role for the interests of Yankee imperialism, ensuring supplies for the State of Israel.

  Imperialism is also deploying its offensive against solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people that arrives from Yemen. Last month the White House decided to again call the Houthis a terrorist organization.

   Since Friday, February 16, this has become effective,
  </a>
  so now there is a justification within the bourgeois legality, to attack in every possible way the support of the struggle of the Palestinian people by the Yemeni people. On the other hand,
  <a href="https://www.defensemirror.com/news/36135/German_Cabinet_Approves_Bundeswehr_Mission_Against_Houthi_Threat_in_Red_Sea">
   German imperialism has already approved the deployment of troops

  in the Red Sea to combat the Houthis, a total of 700 German soldiers will be deployed at least until February 2025. The support of the Yemeni people has not languished facing the new attacks and threats of imperialism. The Houthies have recently successfully hit
