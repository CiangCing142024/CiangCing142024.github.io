 <p>
  The Israeli colonel:
  <b>

  </b>
 </p>
 <p>

  These war instruments are characterized by a very high shooting cadence, especially in the super quick version (120 shots per minute), for the anti-aircraft and anti-missile 'defense' and the naval and coastal bombing. Their maximum range varies from 9 to 20 kilometers away. They have a very high fire capacity thanks to the different types of ammunition used (perforating, incendiary, fragmentation, etc.), against short -range missile systems, planes, ships and terrestrial objectives ".
