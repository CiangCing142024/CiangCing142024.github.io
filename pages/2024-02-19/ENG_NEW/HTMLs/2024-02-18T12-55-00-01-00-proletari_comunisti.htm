    THE 
  prisoners freed from Hamas' custody “will have to receive one 
 close supervision and will be educated on what to say to the media and what 
 No ”, clarified the report.

 </p>
 <p>

   <span>
    To the 
  moment of publication, none of the freed Israelis of 
 Recent he had publicly spoke with the media. The apparitions of 
 prisoners in the Israeli media have become increasingly rare after the 
 Release of Yochaved Lifshitz, 85 years old, which was harshly criticized 
  for having tightened his hand to one of his custodians in Hamas and having 
 recognized that "they treated us with kindness".

 We had imagined "and, in the end, the custodians of the prisoners“ do not have 
 made to them of evil, "said the family member to the newspaper

   <span>
    A 
  Guest of the Israeli Channel Channel 13 News recognized that “it is 
 It is important to remember that many have accused [the former prisoner 
 Israeli] Yochaved Lifschitz [of unfair], but she said 
 Just these things. He suffered bad treatment and was 
 described as the cause of significant media damage, accused of 
 lie because of the prison of her husband, that Hamas influenced her, 
 making it the washing of the brain before its release. But each 
 Word he said was true, and these people do the same 
 statements ".
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    To the 
  time to leave Gaza for Israel, the Israeli prisoner 
 Danielle Aloni left a letter to his Hamas jailers 
 thanking them for "the unparalleled sense of humanity you have 
 shown to me and my daughter Emilia. You were like 
 parents for her, inviting her to your room every time you 
 he wanted. "

  concluded expressing gratitude for "the kind act you have shown 
 here despite the difficult situation you were facing you 
 themselves. And for the difficult losses they hit you here in Gaza. 
 I wish that in this world we could be friends. "

  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    During 
  The prison period, Aloni appeared in a video in which he foiled 
 Netanyahu for his inability to negotiate his release and that 
 of the other hostages.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    While 
  The Israeli government can argue that Aloni was forced to 
 Writing the letter under extreme constraint, has not yet allowed them 
  to speak publicly about his experience in Gaza.
