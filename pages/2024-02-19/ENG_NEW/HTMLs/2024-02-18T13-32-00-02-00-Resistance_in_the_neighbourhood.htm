   THE 
 Establishment of political marriage for homosexual couples was an obligation of 
 Government against the EU in order to complete its agenda in the name 
 of eliminating discrimination.
   <span>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 This famous agenda tries to settle 
 Problems of the bourgeoisie itself or to regulate to its advantage 
 Social groups problems, as their bourgeois people rank 
 some of their special features, to avoid reference to 
 social classes. In the name of always eliminating discrimination, they have 'solved' the 
 Issues of gender inequality. So they were able to, in the name of the equality, 
 to abolish a series of conquests of the female and labor movement, 
 such as early women retirement and legitimize the dismissal of pregnant women.

  First of all, 
 It is wrong to characterize any view in general and vaguely as 
 conservative or progressive. Must always be determined in relation to what 
 compared. Thus the renewal that the bourgeois brings to the form of the family with 
 the homosexual wedding, does not destroy it but instead reinforces it and 
 It adapts to the new data, it refreshes it. David Cameron, from their 
 Conservative leaders in Britain, he once said:
  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">
   "I do not support homosexual marriage even though I am conservative. Him 
 I support because I'm a conservative. "
  </i>
  The English Torks call themselves 
 'Conservatives' because they want to keep customs and customs, principles, tradition and 
 Institutions and above all the family.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt;">
  For the 
 Great class every country still marriage is an economic transaction 
 not done with private contracts (exceptions always exist) nor with 
 pre -empty, but with the mediation of hereditary family 
 civil law. The same laws regulate the possessions of petty bourgeois, only 
 who are dropped by complex and expensive. The same laws apply to 
 Labor family that does not solve it but cause her many problems, 
 since it is considered a privileged a worker who has a home and a car. Into 
 This legal framework is demanding that the bourgeois bourgeois pairs be included and to 
 They do not risk their wealth from sideways. By institutionalization 
 Marriage for same -sex couples do not only benefit the bourgeoisie. The bourgeois class 
 When he legislates, he does so in the name of all the citizens of the state. With 
 This is how other classes benefit. But the equilibrium in 
 Capitalism at the same time conceals and perpetuates class inequality.

  THE 
 Government has passed the controversial bill on their marriage 
 homosexual couples in spite of the lamps he had inward, which he equalized with 
 the influx of votes from the major and minor opposition. There are 
 real disagreements, beyond those reflecting political expediencies, from 
 Merchants of the bourgeoisie for the marriage of homosexuals and on the issues that 
 They are openly opened, which are not few. As sides of 
 The superstructure is related to the law of power and its management, 
 That is, the control of the people. Church, for example, draws its power 
 by the responsibilities given to her in control of their daily lives

 And racism because it disagrees with the political marriage of homosexual couples. Is a one 
 Wrong criticism. The KKE neither despises nor hosters homosexuals, 
 Lesbians, generally people with non -heterosexual sexual orientation. 
 Rightly characterizes the leadership of the LGBTKI "self -proclaimed" and exercises her 
 criticism of the sack of people with different class interests but 
 False lumps all the collectives of LGBTKI. He's the same forgot the 
 Class analysis when talking about marriage and family, parents and children. 
 Its placement is purely systemic. In fact, he possessed by himself 
 moral panic that characterizes bourgeoisie when he feels that the threatened

  The 
 KKE mentions two reasons why he disagrees with their political marriage 
 homosexual couples. The first and the basic, as he writes, is the further 
 commercialization of childbirth and childbirth (adoption). It is about 
 for excuse. It is such the size of the commercialization that already exists 
 with the heterosexual couples, which the homosexuals, much less in number, will simply 
 They are apparently in ready -made circuits. Many will fall victim to

  is that

  The following excerpt is characteristic: '

 More consciously he must also face individual responsibility in childbirth, 
 to realize his responsibility for the new life, which is objectively

 his attempt to justify his attitude towards homosexual couples

 the reality by saying that

  The 
 homosexual couples have the right to marriage and the ability to do 
 family. The point is not to justify marriage and family. Why the 
 marriage does not complete the happiness of two people loved, because it is a 
 Convention with the state on an economic basis, because vows of eternal love are 
 infected with selfishness. Fortunately there is the divorce that can cut off the 
 His lifelong bond, if needed. Family can exist without marriage, without 
 Children, with adolescent children, with only one parent, with same -sex parents, with the 
 A woman older than the man (another taboo and that!)…

  THE 
 Family is the cell of society, they say. She educates the child, 
 It lays the foundations on which every person's personality will be built. When 
 She is sick, all society is sick. In contrast to this dominant narrative, 
 Marxism makes it clear that family is not the cell that lays the 
 society but its derivative. Is part of the superstructure, affects and 
 adapts to society, changes from season to season, evolves to 
 course of centuries. Its evolution is determined by the economic relationships that 
 exist at the given level of production. Always holds two features that 
 appeared with the individual property. Its monogamy and lower position

 penetrate as ideas on all aspects of social activity, in all

 Among its members does not negate the fact that their relationships are unequal

  The

 their parents. The newborn's physical weakness and the child's need for

 Capitalism This position is inconceivable. For the child who is not recognized 
 No autonomy, there are either parents or institution. This situation looks 
 completely natural. The experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, 
 Particularly the conclusions from the cultural revolution raised the issue of 
 Child on a new basis. The socialization of domestic work allowed the 
 children not systematically depend on their mother for their daily 
 problems. Without stopping parents dealing with their children, the 
 Socialist society supported children as a whole. In simple words, the answers 
 on a number of issues related to education, upbringing, 
 Curator and adoption in the context of capitalism contain all errors 
 of the social system.

  Today, 
 Those who shudder with the marriage of homosexual couples invoke the 
 Child Rights. They cannot and do not want to see beyond 
 capitalist system. The KKE in its attempt not to identify with the urban 
 reactive standards and the darkness of the church claims that 
 Progressive changes in the law and work of the woman have balanced 
 the roles of mother and father in raising children. This is not 
 apply. Mother is burdened with daily care of children, deals with 
 almost exclusively with their progress at school and with education 
 their. When the woman has children radically changes her life and enters into 
 New base its relationship with work. When the man becomes a father not 
 similar upheavals are observed. Family in capitalism oppresses the 
 A woman who in turn oppresses children and oppresses them. THE 
 release of a woman by the child, leads to overthrow her role 
 maternity and paternity and ends up in the liberation of his own 
 Child. Woman cannot earn equality with men, if not 
 at the same time raise the issue of overthrowing the oppressive relationship of parents 
 to children.
