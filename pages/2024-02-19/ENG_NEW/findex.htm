  The revolutionary and member
  <em>
   in memoriam
  </em>
  From the editorial board of the New Democracy newspaper, Alípio de Freitas, was honored on February 17 at an event organized by the AJA Lisbon Center in the Portuguese capital. The day marks Alipio's birthday, which would have turned 95. The Poor Peasant League (LCP) of Brazil, which had Alipio as President of Honor, sent a message to the celebration, announcing that the revolutionary will be honored in several honors of workers and peasants of Brazilian lands. The note can be read in full at the end of the matter.
 </p>
<p>
  The message of the peasant organization was devoted to Alipio's wife, Guadalupe Portelinha. “Here in Brazil, the companions of the Belo Horizonte Construction Workers Union (popularly known for over 35 years by the name Marreta, the organization of workers who resumed the union's direction for the class expelling the interveners of the military dictatorship), and Also the Labor League, which together have one of the most heard radio programs in the capital of Minas Gerais, will pay tribute, which will be accompanied by peasants across the country in the revolutionary areas won by LCP, in dozens of acts of celebrations performed throughout the country, ”says the note.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the document, LCP 2024 calendars, decorated with images of the Palestinian National Resistance and the Revolutionary Area Tiago dos Santos, were also sent to Portelinha. They highlight the heroic resistance of the peasants in the revolutionary area who, in the 2021 battles against attempts at eviction, faced a war operation that “frustrated the attacks of the far -right government of the genocide Bolsonaro and the same generals who arrested and torture Alípio De Freitas ”.
 </p>
<p>
  The event aired Tiago Afonso's film “The Cause and the Shadow” and featured musical performances by artists Luanda Cozetti and Bruno Fonseca.
 </p>
<p>
  Alipio de Freitas was an important revolutionary and Portuguese journalist. Throughout his life, he was an important leader of the peasant alloys in Brazil, and became secretary of organization of the organization. During the period, Alipio formed important paintings of the peasant fight and was editor of Jornal das Ligas,
  <em>
   The league
  </em>
  . After the 1964 military coup, Alipio did not abandon the fight and went on to clandestinity. He even lived in Cuba, where he planned his return to Brazil. Back in the country, he was arrested in 1970 and was brutally tortured by the military regime gorillas. Torture did not heat it. In the 1980s, he worked in Agricultural Cooperatives of Mozambique, at the time directed by the then revolutionary Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo) and, until his death, Alipio continued active in political militancy. In 2010, he participated in an expanded meeting of the Poor Peasant League Commission in Goiânia, and in the same year joined the Editorial Board of

    Message from LCP-Brazil to Guadalupe Portelinha for the celebrations of the 95th year of birth of Alípio de Freitas
   </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
  On February 17, 2024, 95 years of the birth of the revolutionary Alipio de Freitas, president of honor of the League of the Poor Peasants-Brazil, are completed.
 </p>
<p>
  We greet your celebrations, how important it is to do!
 </p>
<p>
  Here in Brazil, the companions of the Belo Horizonte Construction Workers Union (popularly known for over 35 years by the name Marreta, the organization of workers who resumed the union direction for the class expelling the interveners of the military dictatorship), and also The Operária League, which together have one of the most heard radio programs in the capital of Minas Gerais, will pay tribute, which will be accompanied by peasants across the country in the revolutionary areas won by the LCP, in dozens of acts of celebrations conducted across the country .
 </p>
<p>
  Let's send you the audio, maybe arrive in time for your celebrations.
 </p>
<p>
  We are also sending them, attached, the LCP 2024 calendars, dealing with two very current topics, on which our dear president dedicated generous years of his indomitable struggle: Heroic Palestinian National Resistance and Agrarian Revolution ( the struggle for the conquest of the land by the Brazilian peasants). Until your hands are not coming to those we send, you can reproduce some copies, the art we are sending allows it.
 </p>
<p>
  We emphasize that the photo of the Calendar of the Agrarian Revolution, a peasant demonstration in the Tiago dos Santos Area during the confrontations that, at the time, 2021, frustrated the attacks of the far -right government of the genocide Bolsonaro and the same generals that arrested and torture Alípio De Freitas, It was taken in Vila Alípio de Freitas, as the peasants called the future urban area of the won lands.
 </p>
<p>
  And at the end of this brief greeting, we would like to manifest you, honorable companion of Alipio, and to the compatriots of this great internationalist, our certainty that today he would be vibrating with the blows of the anti-imperialist struggle dismissed by Palestinian resistance against imperialism and Zionism, the awakening of thousands of masses in this struggle, the failure of opportunism and revisionism around the world; That he would encourage us when he heard the latest reports of advances in our fight, solving problems he faced, he denounced, fought, but his generation could not find the solution. We will live a new wave of the proletarian revolution. May we be together! And we tell them that the verses in honor of Palestinian resistance have the inspiration of our president of honor.
 </p>
<p>

<strong>
   In connection with the 106-year mark of the Finnish working revolution and the boycott campaign against the presidential election, our comrades in Punalippu have posted an action report that we summarize here.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  On January 27, Finnish Maoists, as well as representatives of the Communist Labor Party (KTP) and the Marxist Labor Association (MTL) gathered at the Kalevankanka cemetery in Tampers to honor the class heroes of the Workers Revolution in 1918. Flowers and lights were placed on the grave of the fallen red guardians, followed by the International and speeches.
 </p>
<p>
  The Maoists held the first appeal that dealt with the events and experiences made during the Finnish worker revolution, in addition, it took up the necessity of rejecting reformism and embracing the armed struggle. The election father was also the theme, as well as the international situation. The appeal ended with the slogans: "Living the Finnish working revolution!", "Eternal honor to the 1918 class heroes!", "Live the 130th anniversary of chairman Mao's birth!", "For you under Maoism!", "Fight for the reconstruction of SKP ! »! And "choice, no! Revolution, yes! "
 </p>
<p>
  A representative from the Marxist Workers' Association followed up with a speech about the in -depth crisis in imperialism, the danger of a World War II and the old Finnish state's role as recently incorporated a member of NATO.
 </p>
<p>
  It is interesting to mention that two police officers appeared during the mark. They first stood a little at a distance to observe, and then try to seek out the participants to ask what kind of plans they had for the rest of the day.
 </p>

<p>
  After the mark on the burial ground, the revolutionaries went to the center of Tampers where a demonstration train was held against the bourgeois electrical circus. They marched with red tabs and Palestine flags while shouting slogans as "choices, no! Revolution, yes! "," For you under Maoism! "," Viva Marx, Viva Lenin, Viva Mao Tse-tung! "," Down with the butcher's state! "," For socialism, against imperialism! "," From the River to The Sea, Palestine Will Be Free! ”.
 </p>
<p>
  The march ended at the polling stations in the center of the city where one of the revolutionary participants held this short appeal:
 </p>
<p>
  “The choice of recession is underway, where bourgeois democracy does not even give us the illusion of a choice. Each candidate is pushing for stronger militarization of society, the interests of Finnish imperialism and also the interests of Yankee imperialism against the oppressed people in the world. They support accelerating exploitation of the oppressed countries and justify the Zionist occupation of Palestine and the genocide of the Palestinians. The working class in Finland and the nations in the world has only one alternative: crushing the rotten imperialist system. We too will crush Finnish imperialism with a socialist revolution. Down with the butcher's state! Long live the socialist revolution! ”
 </p>
<p>
  Several appeals were also held on the central square. The Maoists raised much of the same points they had in the appeal at the burial ground, but also added how none of the presidential candidates oppose the Zionist state of Israel. They quoted Lenin there in his time have been talking about how limited the bourgeois democratic dictatorship actually is. It was also concluded here with powerful slogans.
 </p>
<p>
  The Marxist Labor Association again followed up with a speech about the ever deeper crisis of imperialism, NATO's function as a world police and the ever -increasing misery of the Finnish masses. It ended with a strong call to revolution to overthrow the old Finnish state.

<p>
  By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>
<p>
<strong>
   Last Friday, the Technical Calculation Committee posted figures on how last year's wage settlement went. They conclude that last year Norwegians received a reduction in real wages of 0.4 per cent. LO leader Peggy Hessen Folvsik tells NRK that TBU's report makes it possible for this year's wage settlement to be "more spacious" than last year's.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Støre expresses that he "understands" that people expect increased purchasing power, and that he thinks there is hope - but not for everyone. It is the parties that have great responsibility, says Støre, but of course it is not the workers themselves who are at the negotiating table. The negotiations go between the bourgeoisie parties, while their "representatives" in LO "deals on their behalf".
 </p>
<p>
  - We talked about how the economic outlook is, that there is hope that we will see prices and interest rates on the way down, that there is hope that we can increase the purchasing power of people, says Støre.
 </p>
<p>
  When asked if he sees a risk that we enter a payroll and price spiral, he continues:
 </p>
<p>
  - It is in the interest of Ingen. I think the parties in the working life are aware of their responsibilities, and the front -line model has built -in qualities that can secure us against it.
 </p>
<p>
  Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum votes in and agrees with Støre's assessments.
 </p>
<p>
  - We are in a better place when we were last year. It is also the Ministry of Finance's professional assessment that price growth is on the way down and that we have the highest price top behind us, says Vedum pleased.
 </p>
<p>
  NHO's CEO Ole Erik Almlid points out that not everything still goes as greased, and that the construction industry in particular is struggling in particular.
 </p>
<p>
  - I think it is important that there is a balance between expectations you have on both sides. We are committed to showing that there are also companies that are struggling, for example in construction. They must also be taken into account, he says.
 </p>
<p>
  LO leader Peggy Hessen Feelsvik believes that there are good opportunities for employees to have real wage growth this year. However, last year, prices raised "wage growth" does not prevent the LO leader from referring to last year's settlement as good and fronts the same optimism as Støre and Vedum.
 </p>
<p>
  - That said, they made a good settlement last year, and then it turned out that price growth took us again. We will make sure that employees get their share of value creation, she says.
 </p>
<p>
  While the LO leader himself can mix with an annual salary of NOK 2 million, ordinary people are still waiting for it to be their turn this year as well.
 </p>

  Action against Victoriahem's attack on tenants
 </h3>
<p>
  On February 6, the news agency Järva reported that the rental company Victoriahem has sent out a letter where they threaten that tenants have to pay the monthly price of water consumption to tenants in Tensta, west of Stockholm. In the same letter, Victoriahem threatens the tenants that they will send them the crown bailiff if they refuse to let in the landlord to make the installations for this change.
 </p>
<p>
  In response to this, activists conducted a graphite action at the Lätingbacken in Tensta, where those who received the threatening letter live. During the action, the activists were met by tenants in the area who showed their support by cheering on the activists.
 </p>
<p>
  This new attack on the suburban tenants is a continuation of a large number of attacks that Victoriahem has implemented in recent years. Victoriahem runs campaigns to gentrify Stockholm's suburbs and degrade the conditions in the houses they rent out. At the same time, they are constantly raising the rent every year. In 2023, Victoriahem was on the list of Sweden's worst landlords.
 </p>
<p>
  This new requirement for tenants to pay for water is a decision made with the Lesis Association (HGF, our note). This shows the betrayal and the class cooperation of HGF and their total lack of support for and from the tenants. As a counterpart to this class cooperation, there is "Ort to Ort", an alternative tenant organization that oppose cooperation with the landlords. In Husby, they have had a campaign for four years against Victoriahem to push them away from the area. Lately, blockades have been carried out against Victoriahem where the landlord responded with an attempt to throw out the tenants, despite the fact that this fought on this slum host who is what Victoriahem is.
 </p>
<p>
  We travel the slogans:
  <br>
  Water should be free!
  <br>
  Victoria Home Ut Ov Tension!
  <br>
  Support the tenants' struggle!
 </br></br></br></p>

  As the story shows, comrade Lenin, on January 21, 1924, the great leader of the working class and the oppressed people of the world, the other great milestone in Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, became immortal, and left a great legacy of invaluable value. Comrade Lenin's teachings, which transformed the "world of future", whose foundation were laid by Marx and Engels, from an abstract opportunity to a concrete reality, is still fully relevant after a century and major upheavals in the world. In order to be able to position itself correctly in the class struggle, one must accept this 'timeliness' and orientate to it. This "timeliness" is also a cure for reformist, revisionist and parliamentary Cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise of prevailing ideologies of all kinds. It is the guarantee of faith and determination that a communist world can be created.

<strong>
   Lenin as the teacher of communism who broke the ice and paved the way to the international reaction and revisionism
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  To identify the contradictions in the history of the class struggle correctly, to understand moments of historical break and to be clear in these moments of bride was the most excellent feature of the whole friend of Lenin's struggle up to his immortality. After the death of Marx 'and Engels' death, the leadership of the International Proletariat was taken over for a long time by opportunism in the second international, and with mate Stalin's words:
  <strong>
   »
  </strong>
<strong>
   A period when the parties in the second international were unable to take over the theoretical struggle to free the international proletariat and the world's oppressed people from the influence of these opportunistic and class -promoting social democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle for the liberation of the international proletariat and the oppressed people of the world, he developed with the founding of the communist international an organizational and fighting form that suited the dynamics of the class struggle in the new period of capitalism.
  </strong>
<strong>
   «
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Comrade Lenin transformed the Communist Party and the Communist International into a war instrument against the bourgeoisie by freeing the Communist Party and the movement of the Communist International from the Legal Forms' Links:
  <strong>
   »
  </strong>
<strong>
   Instead of a revolutionary policy, philisminism and dirty political negotiations, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary intrigues were escaped. For the sake, of course, "revolutionary" resolutions and passwords were adopted…
  </strong>
<strong>
   «
  </strong>
  , but as it "stores in the offices of the offices", freed from the grip of legal forms of fighting.
  <strong>
   »
  </strong>
<strong>
   Meanwhile, a new period was approaching imperialist wars and the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat. The old fighting methods appeared obviously inadequate and impotent towards the omnipotence of financial capital. It became necessary to revise the entire international activity of the other international, the entire working method, and to expel all philistinism, narrowness, politics tricks, Renegat

<strong>
   name
  </strong>
<strong>
   , social chauvinism and social pacifism. It became necessary to investigate the entire International Arsenal, to throw away all that was rusty and outdated, forced new weapons. Without this preparation, it was useless to go to war against capitalism. Without this work, the proletariat risked finding itself inadequately armed, or even completely unarmed, in future revolutionary struggles. The honor of implementing this general overhaul and general cleansing of other international Augias stable accrued to Leninism.
  </strong>
<strong>

  </strong>
  . (Stalin, about the basis of Leninism)
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Comrade Lenin, with his genius, caught the core of contradiction and realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking the burdens that weigh the back of the international proletariat, without fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses of these views true character in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary connection between the "internal struggle" and the "external struggle", he led the double battle.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Comrade Lenin left us communists the extremely important lesson that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of prevailing reaction. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be purified of revisionism and opportunism.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Keep Lenin's teaching loud in the imperialist system's sharpened contradictions
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The imperialist system that Comrade Lenin analyzed in detail in the early 20th century has survived over the past period, but its contradictions are sharpened and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the integration process in the capitalist system that China underwent preventing the contradictions of exploding for a while, the law of the unequal development of capitalism continued, and the interimperialist rivalry evolved into the "disintegration stage" with regional wars. It shows which crisis system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who for a long time maintained their crisis by moving the system's burdens to the semi -colonies and deepening the plundering of the semi -colonies, have also reached a dead end here.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  One of the explosive points of the inherent problems of the imperialist system that has evolved in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism is that the inter-imperialist struggle that has manifested itself in various forms in recent years is currently being fought in regional Wars. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the interimperialist contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  We can see that the development is in line with comrade Lenin's considerations of the nature and contradictions of imperialism:
  <strong>
   »
  </strong>
<strong>
   The second contradiction is the contradiction between the different financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for sources of raw materials, for foreign territory. Imperialism is the export of capital to the sources of raw materials, the crazy struggle for monopolistic possession of these sources, the struggle for a new division of the already divided world, a struggle that is led with special rage by new financial groups and powers seeking a

<strong>
   space in the sun
  </strong>
<strong>
   «
  </strong>
<strong>
   Against the old groups and powers, which stubbornly hold on to what they have conquered. This crazy battle between the different groups of capitalists is remarkable because, as an inevitable element, it includes imperialist wars, wars for annexing foreign territories. This circumstance, in turn, is remarkable because it leads to a mutual weakening of the imperialists, to a weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to an acceleration of the coming of the proletarian revolution and to the practical necessity of this revolution.
  </strong>
<strong>
   «
  </strong>
  (Stalin, on the basis of Leninism).
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Russia and China, the former socialist countries, which have given the imperialist system a respite with their new markets, have become the main players of the interimperialist rivalry with the hegemonic power of the United States. This means that the scope and nature of the contradictions have grown as new and powerful actors have been involved in the struggle for the redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with Russian imperialism's invasion in Ukraine took place on this background. It is predictable that this trend will be elaborated and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, the areas where the division wars are waged, semi -colonies and colonies. The semi -colonies of the world and oppressed people will continue to pay the price of these wars until the imperialists declare each other direct war.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  With this
  <em>
   will the division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries
  </em>
  - Masterfully analyzed by Lenin - become even more elaborated. The third contradiction is sharpened with the imperialist looting and looting, and the semi -colonial and semi -feudal uprising in powerful national liberation wars and folk wars shaking the imperialist system.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Parallel to the process that imperialism undergoes during the interimperialist contradictions, and the contradiction between imperialist countries and oppressed people and nations becomes all parts of the prevailing system, especially the imperialist states, more centralized, militaristic and warlike than before, which paves the way for All fascist feelings to bring society into a similar ideological format. This is fulfilled either by so -called right -wing extremists or under the guise of social democratic or liberal parties. The Communists and the oppressed people in the world who face a system that becomes more reactionary and aggressive day by day needs a Leninist party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power, as outlined by comrade Lenin, to organize a Strong resistance to this reaction. Only such a party, today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Party, can lead an irreconcilable battle against the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Lenin's great heritage, the Leninist perception of the Party: The General Staff of the Proletariat
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
<strong>
   A revolution is no dinner party or like writing an essay or painting a picture or embroidering; It cannot be particularly refined, particularly stylish and gentle, especially moderate, friendly, polite, restrained and magnificent. A revolution is an uprising, an act of violence through which one class overthrows another.
  </strong>
  (Mao Tsetung).
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they position themselves in relation to development. In the hundred years that have passed since comrade Lenin's death, the imperialists have transformed their ruling structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police, intelligence services, etc. are equipped with capacities that are incomparable to the past. On the other hand, a significant part of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionary" ignore this reality (although it appears to be theoretically accepted) and is far from positioning themselves in accordance with it. But by following an ideological and practical reconciliation line that locks the working class and the oppressed masses stuck in the ruling system, they dampen the anger of the masses and act as breakwaters. While the imperialists and the ruling exploitation structures are equipped with increasingly violent devices and institutions, it is necessary, as supporters of comrade Lenin, to have a strong ideological fight against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionary" and "communists ", Moving further and further away from the reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. Taking comrade Lenin's relentless struggle against opportunism in the second international as a guide to these views is one of the important tasks of doing comrade Lenin justice in the 100th anniversary of his immortality.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Comrade Lenin defined the new type of Communist Party as the "proletariat's war organization". This definition was necessary because of the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution, and the civil war that broke out with the October Revolution, were the specific reasons why comrade Lenin called the Communist Party "the proletariat's war organization". It is a necessity that the Communist Party, which will lead the proletariat's and the oppressed masses, have this trait, while the counter -revolution is armed from top to bottom with violence and funds and commits all these terrible massacres against the working class and the oppressed people. A revolutionary war needs a fighting party to lead it. Only fools and unresolved revisionists who are dependent on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
<strong>
   Some people make fun of us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war", yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; It's good, not bad, it's Marxist. The rifles of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We want to create a democratic republic. Experience in the class struggle in the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only by the power of the rifle that the working class and the working masses can beat the armed bourgeoisi and the armed gentlemen; In this sense we can say that only with rifles can be transformed with rifles.
  </strong>
  (Mao Tsetung).
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At its founding conference, IKF defined the building and reconstitution of communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party developed by Comrade Mao Tsetung is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party that Comrade Lenin outlined, and which was also enriched by Stalin, and it is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party in Marxism- Leninism-Maoism's ideology. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions that we are in, the Communist Party, which is capable of opposing the growing aggression of the imperialist reaction and leading the proletariat and the oppressed people of the world to liberation, must have the quality of a 'proletariat's war organization '.'
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  An essential heritage from Lenin is the question of political power as the basic question of any revolution. Lenin showed how

 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  After Lenin's death, it was his successor Stalin, who brilliantly defined Leninism, further developed it and made it the basis of the entire international communist movement. On the shoulders of the great Lenin, President Mao was able to lead the proletarian world revolution to greater heights and develop the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism, which today is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, must be embraced, defended and used today.

  As an IMF, we will continue to perform the tasks that the great Lenin raised and make good use of the inheritance that Comrade Lenin has left us.

</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  The blocks and agricultural mobilizations that have been erupted throughout the country for weeks have to continue, can win!
 </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  With their long -term mass and nationwide uprising, the farmers forced the government to retreat and maneuver. She was forced to take back what she was saying about "motivated" mobilizations and now appear "open to dialogue". And on the other hand, along with "carrot" we also have the "whip" with the threats of Chrysochoid, prosecutors, etc. The announcements, promises and "we are open to dialogue" are "ash in the eyes" of farmers and were done under the pressure of the mobilizations. The measures announced are rural measures aimed to "deflate" the rural uprising, to break up the farm front and-in particular-to keep it away from the other racing front, the students' front and the youth that these days give Their own great struggle against private universities.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  The farmers left Maximus "with empty hands". Mitsotakis announcements are just what the EU and the anti -graduate CAP allow. The "scratching of the barrel" and the "fiscal stability" that Mitsotakis says is the anti -populist politics that impoverish the people, who destroys workers, who ends up in the poor. The measures for the EFK, the current etc do not solve the fair demands for the survival of the peasantry, to replenish lost income, so as not to apply the CAP that brings cuts to subsidies, for compensation to 100% of the losses, for prices for products and prices and prices and prices for products and prices. for income that covers the cost of life.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  Rural mobilizations are fair. The major and acute problems created by the government's anti -graduation policy, the CAP and the European Union. A policy that year by year poor farmers, leads to abandonment of crops, deserted the villages, captivates the poor, brings the gathering of land and production by neo-cliffs and neo-cigarettes and deepen the country's nutritional dependence.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
  The races can win! Farmers can win! Continuing and escalating the race. With a common front with the other parts of the working people and youth. The many streams of rural uprising can and should become a large river. And this river can swell more if it unite with the other large river of youth and workers and drags anti -populist and anti -anti -anti -anti -anti -anti -rush policy.

  In the photograph above we see four of the six civil surgical instructors who, as volunteers, rushed to the Falkland islands to join the health team that worked at a frantic and incessant rhythm at the Puerto Argentino Military Hospital. However, if the high time in the early days of that June 1982 had made the presence of specialized professionals essential during the stages of the surgical procedure that had become more and more diverse and complex; on the other hand, the intensity of the battles, the ammunition
  <em>
   tracers
  </em>
  Side by side and the growing stage of the explosions made it impossible to land the six young women in the island territory - they remained aboard the Ara Almirante hospital ship Irar that was attracted to Bahía Groussac, in the line of fire, in front of Puerto Argentino .
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, Irizar complied with all the requirements defined by the Geneva Convention of August 1949: the white -painted hull; Several red crosses scattered in visible places; the speedboats adapted for the transport of injuries; the helicopters for their air transfer was also painted white and with the red cross; the evacuation of any and all onboard weapons, ammunition or explosive

  Newly come to the theater of operations of a war that extended by land, sea and air evoke the tension and gravity of what was living. According to Jorge Muñoz, Maria Marta Lemme described her wonder when she realized that a large part of the fired projectiles passed boiling nearby

  . Silvia Barrera told us that at dawn on June 14, where numerous surgeries had been performed, a group of camouflaged English, near the hospital ship, wanted to attack an Argentine troop on the beach. The crew of Irizar, breaking with the awake in Geneva, lit one of the giant reflectors and warned the detachment of Argentines that they were for being attacked.
 </p>
<p>
  Ourselves from Silvia Barrera:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   It was a widespread shooting between the English and the Argentines who were on the beach, and on this day there were people from the irreat who also shot. This has made the rules of the Geneva Council on both sides break. By the time this was happening, we didn't realize, we were in a series of surgical procedures. And in thinking that the irzazing was one of the targets of the shooting… If any projectile reached the oxygen tubes we had to go through the air.

<p>
  On a rainy morning of the autumn Portene, Silvia Barrera offered to receive me for an interview with me a little of her condition as a veteran of Falklands. Silvia suggested to me the place: the internal facilities of the Central Military Hospital of Buenos Aires where 41 years still works from that already distant year 1982.
 </p>
<p>
  I had contacted it by
  <em>
   whatsapp
  </em>
  And I asked you to take some photographs and documents from your personal file - so I could illustrate the article. Silvia said she didn't worry about this. He said he has been visiting several primary and secondary schools for years to explain to students what the Falkland islands and the other South Atlantic Islands were; What is its strategic importance from a historical, economic and geopolitical perspective; its natural riches, oil; the proximity of Antarctica and the Strait of Magalhães, the only place of passage to the Pacific; Silvia tells them what was and how the war came; the work without rest of the health team; the bravery and disaste of those who fought for the sovereignty of a territory that had been claimed in the main international forums within the limits of diplomatic actions for decades; And by his tireless work of social and collective memory, Silvia reinforced me, had a material already prepared to introduce me. It is that, according to her, in her student time what was learned at school was only that the Falklands were Argentine, who were located in the South Atlantic, that the English had usurped them to the Argentines and that one day the islands would pass to be national territory. No more than that.
 </p>
<p>
  In other words, Silvia says that when asked if she would accept to collaborate in the health team in that principle of June 1982, it was for these evil, epic and distant, that she offered to go.
 </p>
<p>
  Says Silvia:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   The petition arrives at the Central Military Hospital on June 7. They gathered all in a room and wonders which of us would accept to go to Falklands. Those who were married and had children said no. And we have been five of us. As the request was 10 instrumentalrs, the petition is referred to the Military Hospital of Campo de Mayo, and one more willing to go. Everything was absolutely new to us, including us. The oldest was 23 years old. All skinny and with the hair to the shoulders at least. We only had summer clothes to take - that's what they gave us. There were no winter clothes in the hospital. Imagine that it was not any winter, but the patagonian winter. We were all civilians without any military instruction. At that time, neither were military women. The clothes that handed us were men's clothes, two numbers above ours. We have not received helmets. We had to bend our sleeve to work. It was all new and improvised. What's more, it was all urgent for yesterday. Aware that on June 7th, we got it right. On the 8th, at four o'clock in the morning, we took the flight towards Río Gallegos. Without any documentation. When we got there, no one was waiting for us. It was in a war. The call message that had left Puerto Argentino to Buenos Aires, days before, had been short, straightforward and objective: we need instrumentalrs. The response from Buenos Aires to Puerto Argentino was equally direct: we sent six.

  And the amazement doesn't stop there. At the journey to Irhzar from Buenos Aires, Susana Maza, Silvia Barrera, María Marta Lemme, Norma Navarro, María Cecilia Richieri and María Angelica Sendes would enter, take off, fly, land and leave an Aerolíneas Argentine plane; They would do some of the route already in Río Gallegos in a jeep without hood, then in a truck and finally rose for the first time in his life in a helicopter. And then the landing on the hospital ship. All entirely new, adrenaline in the heights, but despite that Silvia Barrera states that
  <em>
   We knew that the only women living such a thing would be us, and that was tremendous to us!
  </em>
<em>
   When the helicopter landed on the irzar and unlocked the doors and we went down, it was a general shock. Until then no one had seen women dressed in the military uniform

  It was still June 8, 1982 when the work of
  <em>
   girls
  </em>
  it started. They were distributed in different sectors: Silvia Barrera was crowded in the intensive care and general surgery sectors; Susana Maza in the screening of injuries and cardiovascular surgery; María Marta in General Surgery; Norma Navarro and Cecilia Richieri in traumatology and, finally, María Angelica was concerned with the ophthalmology sector. New injuries arrived at all times, and they were not patients such as they were used to watching at the Central Military Hospital in Buenos Aires. They were wounded that came from the battlefield of a war that advanced toward their ragters. During the interview, Silvia Barrera seemed to make a chronology of the stages of war from the typology of injuries and medical occurrences.
 </p>
<p>
  In its terms:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   (…) Another type of wounded Puerto Hospital are beginning to arrive: the patient with multiple injuries, pump fragments, firearm wounded, are injured with a degree of complexity in growing after a whole month in the whole month Falkland conditions. And then they begin to arrive soldiers with a trench foot, with immersion, with a trench hand, and start to arrive in large quantities. (…) In the specific case of the trench foot, the member becomes black, cutting the circulation, is the freezing of the foot of the combatant that remained sometimes a whole week inside the trenches. Depending on the stage, it is possible to reverse this with anticoagulant medications, with the hyperbaric chambers. Irízar had this equipment. It was an antarctic ship. But if you could not reverse the picture in a day or two, if you had to do the amputation. About five trench foot amputations were made at Irízar.

  Let us go a little about the specific cut that meets Silvia Barrera's report, and here we evidence the testimony of a recruit
  <em>
</em>
  [
  <em>
   colier
  </em>
  ] who suffered from the hardships described by our instrumental in the battlefield itself. This is Daniel Cepeda, born in Villa María, in Cordoba. Cepeda was incorporated in February 1982 and boarded March 26 on the ship
  <em>
   Cabo San Antonio
  </em>
  under the orders of the Warrant Oscar Reyes. It is in the first wave of combatants that will arrive in the Falklands. Cepeda had both feet amputated by freezing. He suffered from the indescribable hardships of the trench foot. If your report invokes the borderfish condition of pain, at no time is it self -industry or loaded from the victim inks. It is important to note that, upon returning from the War Operations Theater, he did not immediately lowered as a certain contingent of recruits, Daniel Cepeda remained hospitalized at the Central Military Hospital until November 1982. Case similar to his is his partner Regiment, the recruit Carlos Moyano, born in Arias, another city of Cordoba. Moyano also suffered amputations on both feet, also by freezing. Remained hospitalized at the Central Military Hospital until his full rehabilitation in 1985. Daniel Cepeda and Carlos Moyano received the military distinction in the form of the medal
  <em>
   The Argentine army to the injured in combat.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Let's look at the testimony of soldier Daniel Cepeda:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   Near this bluff there was a house, like two kilometers. There we got some quilts, one covered, five or six covered for eleven. My feet were already very swollen and I had to stay there for two days. I couldn't walk, I hit my head against the wall of such pain. They made a kind of stretcher and took me. Reyes made us stop: "Please, I ask you, you can't give you, you have to walk." And I wanted to kill him because I couldn't stand the pain, but he was right, then I could recognize the effort he made to carry on us, to motivate us. I remember the first time we set up a fire, he put his feet near the fire, warmed and cried two nights in a row of pain. I asked us to do the same. If we had done just like him, we might cry two days as well, but we would have ridden ourselves. But it was the fate of each of us.

<em>
   The house was abandoned. The only thing we found was a little sugar and flour, and there were some horses. The warrant officer told us to see if we could get some to follow and arrive faster, but they were very rods. Cepeda felt a lot of pain. He took his socks to make a kind of tourniquet and when he wanted to put on his boots again. Neither he nor the Godoy cable could follow. The last to fall was me. When I took the boots it was worse. (…) Just that day I say: “I will try to go out and make signs with the cover”. Because every moment the helicopters passed. The cable said to me, "Hold on a little more than someone will appear." And said and done, before ten in the morning reyes appeared with the English

  Following this, let us follow what Oscar Reyes, the warrant officer of the 25 Infantry Regiment, from the city of General Sarmiento in Chubut, and a conductor of the regiment in which Carlos Moyano and Daniel Cepeda were, among others. Oscar was 23 when the war began. Participated in
  <em>
   Rosary Operation
  </em>
  and was moved to Darwin-Goose Green. Subsequently, it was sent to Marco 234 in the Strait San Carlos, where the British troops landed. By its performance received as a distinction to
  <em>
   Medal to value in combat.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Listen to what the Oscar Reyes Warrant Officer tells:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   They were dying little by little. Godoy no longer wanted to eat, Cepeda and Moyano couldn't get around. In the early hours of the morning I made a weak sun that soon disappeared with the bruked, and I enjoyed this sunshine to get the sick out of the trench. He took his socks so that his feet were airy because they could no longer their boots. The skin becomes yellow, and as soon as there is a pink tone and some stains that then become dark, the sole of the feet becomes hard and turns out to be quite dark. When you will handle it is the gangrene. The boys did not want to surrender, cried and said to me, "Please follow you, leave us here, otherwise they will die eleven instead of three." And so I realized that the best way to help them was to follow the people who were in a position and send the soldier Clot to San Carlos to surrender and request the rescue of the injured. I prepared you, I taught you some phrase in English to ask for help: I'm Soldier… We Need Help…, I left the injured in the highest and so far as possible, I left them food and asked the clot to give me one day of advantage so you could distance the rest of the troop.

  Silvia Barrera recalls that the English bombarded every night because they knew that the Argentines did not have the equipment needed to overcome the absolute pitch of the patagonian night. Daniel Terzano, another
  <em>
   colier
  </em>
  Fighting in Falklands states that the effects of brightness and lighting that was displayed came from the use of signs. And the English made continuous use of this resource. According to him, sometimes, after the canes, he listened to the bangs of mortars and cannons. They were like guides for artillery shots, or for troop advances, or announced the lifting of helicopters.

  When he dawned, in the few hours he lasted the day, the [Camilleros] machines went out to collect the wounded and the dead in combat. Such machiners were 18 -year -old soldiers, chosen to finger. They unfolded from preventing the wounded from uncomposed in pain when they were placed in the stretchers. Silvia draws our attention to the fact that the sale's terrain is stony, with small elevations. Makers countless times, they were forced to run with the wounded in the crossfire of a ongoing war until they arrived at a rescue post where there was a nurse or nursing student who sought to stop the bleeding to prevent bleeding from advancing during the helicopter transfer to the Puerto Argentine hospital. In those days of June, the temperature reached 5 degrees below zero and the winds were absolutely incessant.

  Silvia Barrera says that many of these patients were operated already in the hospital of Puerto Argentino, or if it were not possible, if she stabilized them so that she could resist the transfer to the continent. However, certain patients could not stand the height, the pressurization of the Hercules plane, and behold, the process had to be done through helicopters to hospitals. In the Argentine case, it was Bahía Paradise or Irreat.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end of the war, the Puerto Argentino hospital collapsed, in the terms of Barrera, and it is then that it completely modifies the diagram of what can be in hospitals. Silvia Barrera tells us the case she experienced with her companions and the entire medical staff on the ship Irízar:
 </p>
<p>
  Then we started receiving another type of patient. A patient who is in living flesh, who has to break his clothes, wash it, disinfect him. They are men who haven't bathed for over a month because they were in the trench; And we had to see if there was bleeding, and if there was, where it was bleeding. Of course all this without any anesthesia - because first we had to see where the wound was, if it was just a wound. (…) In the case of
  <em>
   Sparks
  </em>
  - Wounds caused by explosive fragments, cannot be sutured. Just think what the picture was: the splinters entered your skin and what they entered, they carried the material of the clothing, besides the accumulated dirt, add to that, the earth, the snow, the vegetation, all inside, then, then It had to be taking everything around the wound - which has to remain open so that it is not infected.

  I ask Silvia if they were sorting patients, and if this first care was something they, like surgical instructors, were used to doing:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   It was the doctors who evaluated if such a patient went to the operating room, or if this patient could expect. We didn't have any rest time at Irízar. The ship's staff - the drivers, the crew that was responsible for the most diverse internal services of a ship, all had their work routine. We at health did not have. It was zero of rest, and practically zero of food. About what you asked me, yes, we started to accumulate functions. We were nurses, makeshift psychologists. When I say 'nurses' I am referring to the nearby professional, who takes care directly from the patient, who contains him, who takes his arterial, bloodthirsty measures. They are also those that often do and undo bed, which give food, medication, which help locomotion, care essential with hygiene. We are surgical instructors, our preparation is of another order. The patient, under normal conditions, when he arrives at the operating room is already half slept, has already been sedated with a pre-anesthetic. In general, no one knows who the instrumental is in a operating room. We thought that in Falklands it would be exactly the same as we were used to, and there we met another world. Listening to Homeric Shouts, Ensite Straights, things we never imagined seeing and listening, all of this we saw closely, from inside the scene, as protagonists who welcome the patient who feels that he lost everything, the war, a body part or that is on imminence To lose it, this wounded that has become a decapacitated, who does not even know how to remain alive, who has no idea how to have to touch the life that fits him later. We were the ones who welcomed this combatant.

  Silvia Barrera tells us that one day Irízar began to move to 45 degrees, lean, and they had a surgical procedure ahead. They had to tie with pieces of cloth the surgeon, the assistant, the instrumenter (who was she) and that it was necessary to move as in a choreography of rehearsed gestures, as in a contradening. It was a complex surgery that lasted all night - because there were multiple wounds, a bullet in one hand, a
  <em>
   Sparge
  </em>
  In the stomach, and a lot of them in the legs. Everything came out, she says. But it was all absolutely unusual, something that completely escapes the medical routine to which a health team is prepared. Symptom of a war symptom in which the whole world is turned up to head - where it should not extend improvisation or disorganization; Where the lack of organicity between commands and the various links of a plot that is composed of the combatants of different echelons can generate a fatal misconception, an unforgivable strategic error that will inevitably result in the sacrifice of the innumerable human lives.
 </p>
<p>
  Let's look at the testimony of Daniel Terzano:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   It had snowed all night and followed snowing, the earth was totally white and our uniforms could be seen a thousand kilometers away. Not so far, just five hundred meters on the hills in front, while we started our last withdrawal (it was the dawn of June 14) we saw a row of English commands walking just over the mound crest: they walked slowly, no doubt with the Safety of the mission to fulfill, and almost with the absolute certainty of triumph. On the other hand, we were marched quickly on the snow, south, to locate ourselves on the other side of the hill and so it wasn't seen so easily… And that was all we knew we had to do: there was no mission anymore, Only the precipitate, the erratic, the look one and the back, the pure improvisation of survival. (…) So, little by little, without anyone transmitted and no one disobeyed to an order, our direction was twistingly twisting, distractedly, to the west, to the people. Explicitly no one said anything, but the instinct, this cold, white morning of defeat, was invisibly guiding our steps to the place where, by surrender or massacre, would end everything.

  Although the heroism and bravery of those who fought, or speaking otherwise, for this reason, is always highlighted by the immense gesture of devotion of those who were there as anonymous protagonists, sometimes and At so many times, the unpreparedness and disorganization of military commands, or the political capital with which such commands sought to raise themselves for their mistaken choices are equivalent to crimes of Lesa Fatherland or Lesa Humanity.

  It was June 14, 1982. Let's look at this excerpt from the “dialogue” between General Mario Benjamin Menéndez, Military Commander of the Argentine Armed Forces and Governor of the Falkland Islands and the de facto president, General Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri:
 </p>
<p>
  Gal. Benjamin Menéndez: (…) and knowing the responsibility I have to assume, I feel the need to express you all that I said a possibility that I believe viable, which I see as viable. The other clarifies you, general, that as commander I do not see it as viable. I was in the middle of the troops right now, before talking to you, I saw the troops fighting on battle fronts when there is no way to do it… I saw heroes taking and bringing what they can. Perhaps there are also people who retreated because there was no ammunition, many people have been overwhelmed for lack of ammunition… my general, this troop can no longer require more after what has already fought. I had told him yesterday that… this… last night and today would be crucial. We are at noon today and this is as I had expressed it. We have not been able to keep the detachments advanced, we have no space, we have no conditions, we do not count on the support we need and, I believe, my general, who we have to assume a great responsibility to the soldiers will continue to combat a combat without possibilities on time of a few hours more and will cost many lives. This must communicate as commander in Falklands. Exchange.
 </p>
<p>
  Galtieri:… (
  <em>
   silence)
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Benjamin Menéndez: I have nothing more to clarify, my general, I wanted to know if I can wait, after your reflections, that you answer me something. Exchange.
 </p>
<p>
  Galtieri:… (
  <em>
   inaudible
  </em>
  )
 </p>
<p>
  Benjamin Menéndez: My General, I thank the last word, but really, in the last hours of today, I don't know what will be the Falklands anymore. And in this I am willing to assume all the responsibilities that may then fit me. If you have nothing more for me, I cut and that's it.

  According to Silvia Barrera was a shock, as if they all suddenly disinfect when the cease was announced, the surrender of June 14. They didn't even think of this possibility. It had been a few days since they had left their foundations in Buenos Aires thinking that Argentines were keeping their positions in the theater of operations, not that they were winning the war, but they were holding the British's advance and ensuring the defense of the territory. And since then, everyone from the hospital ship health team had to act very quickly and skill. They saw many Argentine combatants humiliated on the beach, in short shorts, at a temperature of five degrees below zero; The British demanded that they would arrange for all uniform and weaponry. How and how much they could, in the irreat, they sought to bring on board the largest possible contingent of Argentine soldiers so that they would not fall prisoners. And they went on this mission until June 18 when the food was over - the ship was full in its maximum load. On the 19th, they landed in Comodoro Rivadavia. On the ship, the work was still incessant. In addition to the numerous injuries, this picture was watched in diarrheal state - it is that numerous soldiers about two months ago only took water in the ponds on the Falkland islands. On June 20, they arrived at Palomar airport at night to avoid the presence of reporters.
 </p>
<p>
  Silvia states:
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   The next day we came to work as if nothing had passed us. No one asked us anything. Everything had already become a thick block of silence. The order was that no more from Falklands was spoken. The men who were welded were not wanted to hire because they said they suffered from post-traumatic stress. And the men were silent to get work. There have been many cases of former combatants who committed suicide. Our group of surgical instructors, when we come back, followed in automatic in our tasks, and over time, we got married, we had children, we were busy with our families and obligations. And all journalists, television programs, did not matter to them what concerned the subject of Falklands.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Silvia also says that the army made them sign a confidentiality document in which it was mentioned that we could not tell anything, absolutely nothing, of what they had lived. Already when they went down in Comodoro Rivadavia, all were put in line, and went to a table in the one that there was a soldier who told them
  <em>
   ‘You have to sign here’
  </em>
  And everyone had to do it. If this was a strategic way of preserving a military secret, it was also a way of repressing/recalcating their experienced experience, this block of past that, according to Silvia, has always returned to them strong and intense. For years in a row, they remained silent after more than a decade began to speak those who were more resilient. Beginning to speak, process in their heads what had been lived, how those months, those weeks, those days who never sinks into the distant and untouched past were lived. And in such a way that even today, more than forty years old, there are those who can not speak. Of the six, there are people who say nothing. That preferred to stay silent. Silvia Barrera was the first to witness, and never stopped doing so. She says you need to know much more than to know those of their generation.
 </p>
<p>
  Before we said goodbye, after the photograph ballooned to the personal archive, I ask Silvia if she volunteers once again if, by chance, the fate of Falklands demanded her effort and sacrifice. She laughs sneaky and sincere and answers me
  <em>
   Of course, and it would be easy, I'm ready, Falklands is in me.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  For over 5 months, the Nazi crime of the Zionists in the Gaza Strip continues with the blessings and support of American imperialists. Without the two "basic" goals of the Israeli leadership have been achieved since the start of the invasion, namely the elimination of Hamas and the overall Palestinian resistance and the release of prisoners. Along with these two goals, the void has fallen in the void of the longing for the Zionists, the Nazi inspiration "final solution". The mass displacement, the genocidal slaughter and the disappearance of the Palestinians from their homeland.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The armed Palestinian resistance has managed to put obstacles and reach significant successes against the plans of the occupation forces. No operational possibility of resistance (which really seemed to have) would be enough if it did not have the support of its people. The heroic Palestinian people are stubbornly refusing to leave their territories despite the mass killings and crimes of the fascist-Sionists.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The cowardly Israeli invaders, because they cannot bend the heroic resistance, crumble and blast as many houses as their bombardment has left. In the face of the important international outcry and the magnificent solidarity demonstrations throughout the globe. In the face of the pressures of US bosses and European imperialists to sign a cease agreement, threaten and blackmail with a large invasion operation on Rafa. Where they have fled more than a million displaced from the Gaza Strip North, a development that will mean a multiple blood bath. At the same time on the West Bank, the pogroms and the murders of the army in collaboration with fascist settlers are intensifying with the aim of displacement of the Palestinians.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The wider developments in the Middle East are very dangerous not only for the peoples of the region but also of the whole planet. The ongoing bombings of American and English imperialists in Yemen. Israeli's adventurous missile attacks on Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, the murderous bombing in Iran a few weeks ago, as well as the deaths of three US soldiers, raise the confrontation and competition at levels of generalized escalation.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The continuing slaughter of the Palestinian people by the Zionists and their support by the Americans and Europeans is a message to the peoples of the world. This will be the treatment and fate of those who resist. The Greek people and the youth, who have been on the streets against anti -educational measures for six weeks, must continue to show its solidarity with the fair struggle of the Palestinian people for freedom massively massives. Require the country's unblocking from the war dangers that the government and bourgeoisie are willing to drag by sending frigates to American and European war missions.

    A 
  "exciting" service of a company of tanks all

 admissions by the captain of the twenty year old - identified only as 
 "Karni" - who was ordered by a soldier "in panic" of 
 open fire on the homes of the Kibbutz holit, regardless of the 
 fact that contained civilians or not.

 compatriot simply replied "I don't know" and ordered them to 
 "Shoot" however a tank shot against the buildings.

    While 
  the Israeli government and its army of international propagandists 
  They only blamed Hamas for a series of macabre killings on 7 
 October, together with unfounded statements of rapes, torture e 
 beheadings of children, the comments in the N12 report are added to 
  a growing body of tests that show that the bombings of 
 Israeli tanks are responsible for many of the victims suffered 
 in Israeli Kibbutzim. According to the soldiers interviewed, among others 
 killed by the company of tanks in question are alleged 
 Palestinian militiamen to whom they say they have crushed them to death the

    The 
  revelations that Israeli troops received 
 the order to open the fire indiscriminately on the communities

 Desperate efforts to control the narrative of the Gaza war.

<span>
    TO 
  followed by an agreement of ceased the temporary fire it saw 
 Dozens of Jewish prisoners released by Gaza starting from 24 
 November, Israel channel 12 revealed that the authorities of Tel 
 Aviv have established new rules that require that the Israelis 
 freed they are strictly monitored when they give interviews.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    THE 
  prisoners freed from Hamas' custody “will have to receive one 
 close supervision and will be educated on what to say to the media and what 
 No ”, clarified the report.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    To the 
  moment of publication, none of the freed Israelis of 
 Recent he had publicly spoke with the media. The apparitions of 
 prisoners in the Israeli media have become increasingly rare after the 
 Release of Yochaved Lifshitz, 85 years old, which was harshly criticized 
  for having tightened his hand to one of his custodians in Hamas and having 
 recognized that "they treated us with kindness".

</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    THE 
  Recent comments from a relative of another elderly Israeli woman 
 Released on November 24, Ruth Munder seem to validate this 
 Thesis.

  The period spent by the Israelis in Gaza, the family member said:

  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    Contrary 
  to our fears ”, Munder“ did not meet the horrible stories that 
 We had imagined "and, in the end, the custodians of the prisoners“ do not have 
 made to them of evil, "said the family member to the newspaper 
 Israeli Jerusalem Post.

<span>
    At the 
  same way, the sister of a Thai worker taken hostage a

 "Treated very well" and "seemed happy" when it was released.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    A 
  Guest of the Israeli Channel Channel 13 News recognized that “it is 
 It is important to remember that many have accused [the former prisoner 
 Israeli] Yochaved Lifschitz [of unfair], but she said 
 Just these things. He suffered bad treatment and was 
 described as the cause of significant media damage, accused of 
 lie because of the prison of her husband, that Hamas influenced her, 
 making it the washing of the brain before its release. But each 
 Word he said was true, and these people do the same 
 statements ".
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    To the 
  time to leave Gaza for Israel, the Israeli prisoner 
 Danielle Aloni left a letter to his Hamas jailers 
 thanking them for "the unparalleled sense of humanity you have 
 shown to me and my daughter Emilia. You were like 
 parents for her, inviting her to your room every time you 
 he wanted. "
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    Has 
  concluded expressing gratitude for "the kind act you have shown 
 here despite the difficult situation you were facing you 
 themselves. And for the difficult losses they hit you here in Gaza. 
 I wish that in this world we could be friends. "
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    During 
  The prison period, Aloni appeared in a video in which he foiled 
 Netanyahu for his inability to negotiate his release and that 
 of the other hostages.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    While 
  The Israeli government can argue that Aloni was forced to 
 Writing the letter under extreme constraint, has not yet allowed them 
  to speak publicly about his experience in Gaza.

<p>
  The United Arab Emirates (EAU) announced that three of their soldiers and a Bahrain military officer were killed in an attack on General Gordon's military base in Mogadiscio, Somalia's capital, on February 10. Initially the information pointed out that, in addition, two soldiers were injured and later it was reported that one of the injured had died. Among the dead soldiers of the United Arab Emirates was Colonel Mohamed Mubarak al Mansouri. The attack was claimed by the armed al-Shabab group, which is waging an armed struggle against the Somalian government.
 </p>
<p>
  Several imperialist countries act in Somalia under the justification of “stabilizing” the country. The dead soldiers were part of the EAU troops that train soldiers from the Armed Forces Somalis in the General Gordon field to combat Al-Shabab's armed struggle in the name of Yankee imperialism, mainly. The EAU Armed Forces have been operating in Somalia for decades. In addition to the EAU, the Somalian military receive military support and training directly from USA and its minions, such as Turkey. There is also an African Union “Peace Maintenance” mission supported by the UN in the country, but it is slowly withdrawn and passing responsibility to the Somalian Armed Forces. We have already reported earlier about the action of Al-Shabab against this operation. In an analysis by a
  <em>
   think
  </em>
<em>
   tank
  </em>
  From the US, it is described that the presence of EAU troops is important to USA's interests in the horn of Africa, for which al-Shabab represents a great danger, as the USA admitted.
 </p>
<p>
  The United Arab Emirates, as well as several Arab states, such as Egypt, condemned the attack and asked for more international efforts to combat “terrorism,” revealing their true sectional nature of American imperialism, despite great speeches.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite all the efforts of the imperialists and their minions, Al-Shabab continues to control much of Somalia and has the constant support of the masses in these areas. In 2022, the organization was forced to retreat in some areas by the Somali government forces, but managed to launch a counterfensive, intensifying actions against military bases.

   The first to arrive were they: the 
 Women in black of Verona. Also this year they found themselves on time 
  at the opening of the Fair gates. Silent, behind the 
 gate and big signs in hand where they read written as «the 
 diffusion of weapons does not increase our safety "," we already have 
 Giulietta and Romeo, we do not need guns "," teaching to love and not a 
 shoot". Mostly ignored signs by the crowd of visitors who, 
 Since the first morning, he has been crowded at the entrance of Eos, acronym 
 For European Outdoor Show.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    The new guise
   </strong>
   of the traditional weapon fair 
 of Verona, after a long negotiation with pacifist associations and the 
 Common, has agreed to lower the tones and camouflage itself into one 
 exhibition dedicated to hunting, shooting and fishing, removing the 
 contested term "personal defense weapons". As if in our country, 
  in which all semi -automatic weapons are considered guning weapons, there 
  It was a distinction between a "sporting" gun and a defense.
  </p>
<p>
   Just the "camouflage" of what remains a mere anyway 
 exposure of weapons, was considered unacceptable by the network 
 Veronese for Palestine, considering that among the approximately 300 exhibitors
   <span>

</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
  They also appear Israeli companies or in any case companies that provide weapons 
  to Israel, as well as to many other nations that do not shine for the 
 Defense of human rights. “Weapons are exposed to this fair that 
 They are used to repress dissent - explains Mackda Ghebremariam 
 Tesfau ', activist for the rights of the Palestinians - to exhibit their 
 Death products include the major weapons of the world, 
 Because those who sell hunting, shooting and sports weapons, defense 
 personnel, also equips the armies, which bring horror and 
 destruction through permanent global war. War falling 
  As always on the civilian population, as is happening in Gaza ».
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   About a thousand activists and activists accepted the appeal 
 of the Association and gathered behind the large banner «Stop al 
 genocide. We disarm Israel ». From Piazza della Fiera, the procession has 
 marched around the exhibition venue to conclude in front of the gates 
  entry where some scuffles occurred with the forces of 
 police who have not spared the batons. In the end i 
 Protesters, however, managed to exhibit a Pro Gaza banner 
 In front of the entrance and remained in the evening to shout slogan against 
 Israel and the war industries.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Among the members
   </strong>
   to the event, associations 
 For rights, for disarmament, social centers, parties such as the Greens, 
 Left and re -foundation and also many animalistic organizations that 
 Of course they will not have liked the statements of the regional councilor 
 Veneto to sport, Cristiano Corazzari, who from the inside 
 of the exhibition remarked the fundamental role of the hunters, a 
 his saying, authentic environmentalists "who in perfect agreement with the 
 Region play a fundamental role in the environmental management of 
 territory to the fullest of the community ». Remarking below how 
  «People who are in here is the best because they are people who respect the 
  rules".

   Maybe, the commissioner did not refer to compliance with the ethical code - 
 a novelty of this year expressly desired by the Municipality - who asked 
 to the exhibitors not to put the weapons in the hands of children. Disposition 
 also supported by the Police Headquarters but which has been completely disregarded.
  </p>
<p>
   Giorgio Beretta, author of the book
   <em>
    The country of arms
   </em>
   (Other economics), he tweeted from inside the fair: «But the police station is 
 checking that its provision on the preload to minors of 
 handle weapons is applied? I saw many children with weapons in 
 hand with lots of images - with a darkened face - of children playing with 
  bigger rifles of them ».
  </p>
<p>
   "How much hypocrisy! Do you think that at the wine fair entry to minors 
  It is rightly forbidden. Here, on the other hand, is even free! », He has me 
 a lady whispered with a sign written in her hand: «Also the 
 Weapons held legally killing women ».

   THE 
 Establishment of political marriage for homosexual couples was an obligation of 
 Government against the EU in order to complete its agenda in the name 
 of eliminating discrimination.
   <span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 This famous agenda tries to settle 
 Problems of the bourgeoisie itself or to regulate to its advantage 
 Social groups problems, as their bourgeois people rank 
 some of their special features, to avoid reference to 
 social classes. In the name of always eliminating discrimination, they have 'solved' the 
 Issues of gender inequality. So they were able to, in the name of the equality, 
 to abolish a series of conquests of the female and labor movement, 
 such as early women retirement and legitimize the dismissal of pregnant women.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt;">
  First of all, 
 It is wrong to characterize any view in general and vaguely as 
 conservative or progressive. Must always be determined in relation to what 
 compared. Thus the renewal that the bourgeois brings to the form of the family with 
 the homosexual wedding, does not destroy it but instead reinforces it and 
 It adapts to the new data, it refreshes it. David Cameron, from their 
 Conservative leaders in Britain, he once said:
  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">
   "I do not support homosexual marriage even though I am conservative. Him 
 I support because I'm a conservative. "
  </i>
  The English Torks call themselves 
 'Conservatives' because they want to keep customs and customs, principles, tradition and 
 Institutions and above all the family.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.2pt;">
  For the 
 Great class every country still marriage is an economic transaction 
 not done with private contracts (exceptions always exist) nor with 
 pre -empty, but with the mediation of hereditary family 
 civil law. The same laws regulate the possessions of petty bourgeois, only 
 who are dropped by complex and expensive. The same laws apply to 
 Labor family that does not solve it but cause her many problems, 
 since it is considered a privileged a worker who has a home and a car. Into 
 This legal framework is demanding that the bourgeois bourgeois pairs be included and to 
 They do not risk their wealth from sideways. By institutionalization 
 Marriage for same -sex couples do not only benefit the bourgeoisie. The bourgeois class 
 When he legislates, he does so in the name of all the citizens of the state. With 
 This is how other classes benefit. But the equilibrium in 
 Capitalism at the same time conceals and perpetuates class inequality.

  THE 
 Government has passed the controversial bill on their marriage 
 homosexual couples in spite of the lamps he had inward, which he equalized with 
 the influx of votes from the major and minor opposition. There are 
 real disagreements, beyond those reflecting political expediencies, from 
 Merchants of the bourgeoisie for the marriage of homosexuals and on the issues that 
 They are openly opened, which are not few. As sides of 
 The superstructure is related to the law of power and its management, 
 That is, the control of the people. Church, for example, draws its power 
 by the responsibilities given to her in control of their daily lives

 And racism because it disagrees with the political marriage of homosexual couples. Is a one 
 Wrong criticism. The KKE neither despises nor hosters homosexuals, 
 Lesbians, generally people with non -heterosexual sexual orientation. 
 Rightly characterizes the leadership of the LGBTKI "self -proclaimed" and exercises her 
 criticism of the sack of people with different class interests but 
 False lumps all the collectives of LGBTKI. He's the same forgot the 
 Class analysis when talking about marriage and family, parents and children.

  The 
 KKE mentions two reasons why he disagrees with their political marriage 
 homosexual couples. The first and the basic, as he writes, is the further 
 commercialization of childbirth and childbirth (adoption). It is about 
 for excuse. It is such the size of the commercialization that already exists 
 with the heterosexual couples, which the homosexuals, much less in number, will simply 
 They are apparently in ready -made circuits. Many will fall victim to 
 Aetonians, as the heterosexuals fall.

  is that

  The following excerpt is characteristic: '
  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">
   The more man evolves socially, the more 
 More consciously he must also face individual responsibility in childbirth, 
 to realize his responsibility for the new life, which is objectively 
 Dependent of parents and especially the mother for a significant time

 Maternity is removed as conquering the long development of man »

 In short, he refers to classic urban conservative position how destination of 
 It is a human being to give birth and how childbirth is an individual responsibility. Disintegrates 
 the concepts of paternity and maternity from their class trunk when he claims

  The 
 homosexual couples have the right to marriage and the ability to do 
 family. The point is not to justify marriage and family. Why the 
 marriage does not complete the happiness of two people loved, because it is a 
 Convention with the state on an economic basis, because vows of eternal love are 
 infected with selfishness. Fortunately there is the divorce that can cut off the 
 His lifelong bond, if needed. Family can exist without marriage, without 
 Children, with adolescent children, with only one parent, with same -sex parents, with the 
 A woman older than the man (another taboo and that!)…

  THE 
 Family is the cell of society, they say. She educates the child, 
 It lays the foundations on which every person's personality will be built. When 
 She is sick, all society is sick. In contrast to this dominant narrative, 
 Marxism makes it clear that family is not the cell that lays the 
 society but its derivative. Is part of the superstructure, affects and 
 adapts to society, changes from season to season, evolves to 
 course of centuries. Its evolution is determined by the economic relationships that 
 exist at the given level of production. Always holds two features that 
 appeared with the individual property. Its monogamy and lower position

 Capitalism This position is inconceivable. For the child who is not recognized 
 No autonomy, there are either parents or institution. This situation looks 
 completely natural. The experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, 
 Particularly the conclusions from the cultural revolution raised the issue of 
 Child on a new basis. The socialization of domestic work allowed the 
 children not systematically depend on their mother for their daily 
 problems. Without stopping parents dealing with their children, the 
 Socialist society supported children as a whole. In simple words, the answers 
 on a number of issues related to education, upbringing, 
 Curator and adoption in the context of capitalism contain all errors 
 of the social system.

  Today, 
 Those who shudder with the marriage of homosexual couples invoke the 
 Child Rights. They cannot and do not want to see beyond 
 capitalist system. The KKE in its attempt not to identify with the urban 
 reactive standards and the darkness of the church claims that 
 Progressive changes in the law and work of the woman have balanced 
 the roles of mother and father in raising children. This is not 
 apply. Mother is burdened with daily care of children, deals with 
 almost exclusively with their progress at school and with education 
 their. When the woman has children radically changes her life and enters into 
 New base its relationship with work. When the man becomes a father not 
 similar upheavals are observed. Family in capitalism oppresses the 
 A woman who in turn oppresses children and oppresses them. THE 
 release of a woman by the child, leads to overthrow her role 
 maternity and paternity and ends up in the liberation of his own 
 Child. Woman cannot earn equality with men, if not 
 at the same time raise the issue of overthrowing the oppressive relationship of parents 
 to children.

  Press Release
 </p>
<p>
  Date: 21-1-2024
 </p>
<p>
  Hail the heroic raid by the militant PLGA red warriors on Darmavaram Police camp on 16th Jan, 2024
 </p>
<p>
  Central Regional Bureau of CPI (Maoist) hail the unprecedented heroic attack of PLGA on the Central Armed Police Force Darmavaram camp in Pamed area of Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh established to suppress the revolutionary movement as an integral part of carpet (grid) security. Our PLGA red-fighters along with the involvement of thousands of revolutionary masses were successful to execute such heroic raid on the fascist paramilitary forces. Let us hail their militant raid in the background of “Operation Kagaar-surya Shakti” and salute them. Let us appreciate and convey our revolutionary greetings to those revolutionary masses who participated in the raid.
 </p>
<p>
  Around 7:05 PM on 16th January, 2024 the PLGA forces surprisingly carried out the raid on the enemy camp, and it lasted till 10:05 PM. In this 3-hour raid, our PLGA guerillas fired more than 600 hundred grenade launcher shells and other country made grenades with rapid firings before enemy came to know about what is going on. According to our reliable confidential report, 35 police personnel were wiped out and more than 40 were seriously injured in this raid. Our guerillas prior to this raid took under their control the entire periphery of the police camp. To disable the movement of additional forces during the raid the local people blocked the roads with huge tree logs and the militia kept land mines to explode the incoming additional forces. Our 3 beloved comrades Com. Devalu, Coy Commander, Vikram Battalion member and Madkam Devalu People’s militia member who fought bravely and became martyrs in this raid. While trying to reach the epicenter of the camp these three comrades came in the rapid firing of LMGs fitted MPVs. All ranks and files of the Party, PLGA and United Front pays its revolutionary homage to those 3 martyrs beloved comrades who fought with supreme revolutionary spirit against the enemy forces.
 </p>
<p>
  The Police officials and the state and the central government are silent regarding the raid and putting all efforts to keep the numbers of police casualties in the 16th January raid in darkness. The enemy remains very serious to hide the losses it suffered to keep the morale of their forces on the eve of “Operation Kagaar-Surya Shakti” which was declared very recently to take Maad area in their hands and began their operation. The police have barricaded the total area and even not allowing the journalists to cover the facts and figures of the raid. Such an act by the enemy amounts to fabrication of facts and injustice to its own personnel who died in the raid and even their ‘sacrifices’ for their corporate masters and police bosses will remain in vain.
 </p>
<p>
  Why the police bosses are silent on the casualties? In this month thousands of police personal has been deployed in Bastar division particularly Narayanpur District to establish several new police advanced base camps. In order to keeps the morale high of those recently deployed new forces the police higher officials hiding the facts. Further reason is that the opposition parties will criticize the newly elected BJP government in Chhattisgarh state as it is impotent to tackle the Maoists. The ongoing Ram-Jambhoomi temple consecration politics of BJP- RSS does not get any diversion, keeping this in mind there remains silent from the police officers regarding the casualties they suffered. Finally, in the lieu of the upcoming 2024 General Election and to preserve its power at the center, the BJP under the leadership of Narendra Modi has kept the causalities hidden from the public. After all this, Amit Shah has recently stated in the Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) forces foundation ceremony that the BJP government under the leadership of Narendra Modi will finish 80 percent of Maoist movement in the coming three years.
 </p>
<p>
  16th January attack is a befitting reply to the recently launched fascist “Operation kagar-Surya Shakti” by the Imperialists watch dogs, the Brahmanical Hindutva fascist rulers to eradicate the Maoist movement, and to the ongoing onslaught on the Adivasi people by the military and police forces. It is a peoples’ fitting reply to the enemy’s violence which has been unleashed for the loot of the natural resources by the big corporate sharks like Adani from the tribal belts. 16th January raid by our PLGA forces is a militant resistance to the corporatization-militarization of the forest lands which is causing to massive displacement of Adivasis people from their forest lands and heavy destruction to environment. Revolutionary people will not tolerate the injustices meted out to them anywhere and our Party and PLGA always hail their rights and just demands. The brave masses of Dandakaranya are learning the war through war since the last two decades. They are tirelessly fighting against one after another fascist military campaigns and against corporatization and militarization of their lands and forests since the separate state of Chhattisgarh was formed in the year 2000.
 </p>
<p>
  Central Regional Bureau of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all mass organizations, friends and well-wishers of Indian revolution and oppressed masses to celebrate and propagate the heroic and valiant raid by the PLGA forces on the highly militarized police camp in Dharmavaram in Pamed area of Chhattisgarh on 16th January, 2024 and demand the government to come out with facts to express its grief to the Jawans families. Our Party appeals to all mass organizations, Human Rights activists, Trade Unions, Peasant organizations, students, journalists and democratic and well – wishers of tribal and toiling masses to continue their resistance against the corporatization and militarization of the forest lands, privatization of public sectors and against the ongoing repression on the tribal people and the oppressed masses by the fascist BJP forces under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Our Party earnestly requests to the deceased police families and all police families to call your dear ones from the police camps established in the revolutionary people’s struggle area and appeal them to leave the undignified police jobs. Our Party is once again assuring that that it will carry its revolutionary movement forward whatever and how much fascist military campaigns may be carried out against it, but it will fight until the end of this rotten system.

  Dear Revolutionary people!
 </p>
<p>
  We are going to celebrate 114 Bhumkal Diwas on 10th of February. In 1910 Adivasi people of Bastar revolted against British imperialism and established in Barsur their ‘Madiya Raj’ (state). Our heroic Madia people celebrate Bhumkal Day in the memory of that great people’s revolt. After the establishment of Madiya state on 10th February Jantana sarkar was practiced for 40 days. Let us say Jai Sewa and Jai Johar to martyr Gundadhar and all his comrades- inarms who sacrificed their lives while revolting against British colonialism for the establishment of Madiya state. By continuing the glorious history of Bhumkal revolt and by forging unity between Adivasi and non-Adivasi people of Dandakaryana, and carrying forward the ideals of great Bhumkal heroes who laid down their lives for the establishment of Jantana Sarkar, let us pay our revolutionary homage to them. Central Regional Bureau conveys its revolutionary greetings to the people of Dandakaryana who are marching relentlessly on the path laid down by the great Bhumkal warriors.
 </p>
<p>
  Dandakaryana (DK) is predominantly an Adivasi area which is composed of different tribal communities. The area is abundant with mineral resources. Adivasi people of DK are struggling for water, land and forest, identity, self-respect and to seize political power since 1980 under the leadership of CPI (Maoist). They are consolidating in the revolutionary mass organizations and struggling against the loot and plunder of natural resources by the Indian state which is a big tool and suppressive machine in the hands of feudal and compradors classes supported by the imperialists. Under the banner of “Land to the tiller-All Powers to the Revolutionary people’s committees”, the people of DK have established alternative Political Power organs- Jantana Sarkara and are democratically executing the people’s power. This jantana Sarkar organs are presenting a new alternative development model in the country. The predatory ruling classes of India are continuously trying to dismantle the alternative people’s state power through its military force. It is trying to legitimize its repression through bourgeois reforms. But our jantana Sarkar is giving a befitting reply to all anti- people measures and machinations to wipe out jantana Sarkar and people are showing extraordinary resilience against the exploitative ruling classes’ actions and policies. Hail the revolutionary DK people who are fighting for the protection, consolidation, and expansion of the jantana Sarkar.
  <a>
</a>
</p>
<p>
  The Indian Central government enacted PESA in 1996 by replicating Jantana sarkar programs and policies to divert the masses from the revolutionary path. As per this law in all 10 states that comes under the fifth scheduled area of the Indian constitution, adivasi people are having guaranteed rights over their forests. The essence of the act is that it is imperative to take the consent of the gram sabha to do any work in the fifth scheduled area. 28 years has lapsed since the enactment of the PESA by the central government but it has never been implemented properly by the state governments. In the various areas of the fifth schedule the Adivasi people are exposing the deceitful nature of the government in the implementation of PESA and they are demanding for the implementation of the act. The state governments are suppressing their just struggles by hook and crook. Adivasi people are continuing their struggle for their rights even during the intensification of severe repression. It is time to take a pledge on 10th of Feb by declaring that “this forest is ours, and it is our birth right over the natural resources of the forests, we have to exercise it, and we will never leave this struggle.”
 </p>
<p>
  Why the central government and state governments are suppressing our Jantana Sarkar? Our people must understand this issue conscientiously. Central and state governments are working to hand over all the natural resources including forests to the big corporate houses and MNCs. In the name of the development of nation and people, mess has been created in the lives of the people by the ruling classes. In the name of development multiple mining projects have been started without taking the consent of gram sabha as per PESA.
 </p>
<p>
  Unprecedented destruction has happened in all those areas where the mines are in function. And people in huge number have become victim of displacement. In the mining zones people’s agricultural productive lands has turned into toxic and are becoming unsuitable for the agriculture due to capitalist pollution. Drastic destruction of environment is happening at lightning speed. To understand this naked dance of destruction, Surjaghad (Gadchilori), Raoghat (Naryanpur), Amdai (Kondagoan) and Hasdeo (North Chhattisgarh) are few glaring examples in front of our eyes. By hiding this catastrophe and depicting it as development, every one right from PM Narendra Modi to MLAs are signing the same tune of development. By looting our natural resources, the exploitative governments and mischievous political leaders are deceiving people especially our youths in the name of jobs and Job fairs. Giving security guard posts and other menial jobs in mines on meager wages, the government is plundering our invaluable natural resources on an extensive scale. The local middle men of corporate houses are creating a rift among the local people in the name of jobs and development. Actually, they are hiding the real plight of the people.
 </p>
<p>
  The central and state governments are colluded with MNCs and Indian corporate houses turning the forests into corpratiztion-militarization. Recently chief minister of Maharashtra, Ek Nath Sindhe has announced that the naxal affected backward Gadchilori district will be transformed into an industrial hub by 2030. On the other side, Chhattisgarh Home Minister and Deputy Chief Minister stated that there is no development without mining projects. All state governments in the fifth scheduled is organizing in the name of vibrant conferences to delight the NRIs entrepreneurs and signing number of MoUs amounting to hundreds of billions dollars and majority of those MoUs are in mining sector.It is crystal clear to the people that their lives will be destroyed in the near future if they allow the execution of those MoUs. So, it is a suitable occasion to take a pledge to save your lives, forests and environment.
 </p>
<p>
  The newly formed BJP government of hindutva forces in Chhattisgarh has opened some new police stations on war footing manner in the name of liquidating the Maoist party. Similar steps are being followed in other states like Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, etc; of the central region and in Eastern regions states like Jharkhand, Bihar, etc. In this process the central government has started new military operation in the name of “operation kagaar” (Final War). The stated task of this military operation is to get control over the Maad hills to eliminate the central leadership of the party. But the hidden agenda behind this fascist operation is to grab the hills to exploit the natural resources. So, our party appeals to the masses on the Bhumkal Day occasion to save the pious Maad hills which are abode of tribal gods and goddess, and remains as an ancestral heritage. At the same time our party appeals to all democrats, human rights activists, well-wishers of tribal, students, lawyers, journalists, poets, writers, artists, employees, workers, peasants’ organizations to stand steadfastly behind the particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) of Maad region. To safeguard our major achievements in more than 4 decades, it is our prime duty and responsibility to retaliate and defeat the fascist “Operation Kagaar”. At the same time our party appeals to friends of Indian Revolution abroad to take militant solidarity programs.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   *Let us take pledge to protect Jantana sarkar, make it strong and expand it.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   * Let us take pledge to retaliate and defeat “Operation Kagaar”.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   * Let us take pledge to continue militant struggles to achieve rights on forests.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   * Let us take pledge to fulfill the ideals of the martyrs who laid down their lives for the construction of Jantana Sarkar.

<p>
  Fascism has its particularities so differs in forms and carries specific characteristics in different concrete
  <br>
  conditions. In Indian concrete conditions, the nature of fascism is Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism. Rise of Hindutva forces to political power is fundamentally aligned with bogus Indian Parliamentary democracy.
  <br>
  Even at this unprecedented moment of crowning glory, the Hindutva saffron brigade is showing no such
  <br>
  serious threat to the parliamentary system as because the latter is proving to be no real threat to its
  <br>
  kingdom of animosity. Such poses a serious question to the very set up of parliamentary democracy.
  <br>
  Ambedkar has rightly opined in his ‘State and Minorities’ that political democracy never been an aspect
  <br>
  of Indian state, but on the contrary Indian democracy is predominantly communal majoritarian upper-
  <br/>
  class democracy. Hindutva Fascism in India finds its breeding ground in the farcical structure of
  <br/>
  parliamentary democracy. We will try to understand the politics of Hindutva forces in the background of
  <br/>
  the inauguration of Ram Temple on 22nd January.
  <br/>
  The construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya and its consecration by PM Modi has taken the ignorance
  <br/>
  of our argumentative minds to a next higher level. Mainstream media who are nurtured under the care
  <br/>
  of Narendra Modi government and RSS has played formidable role in perpetuating such ignorance and
  <br/>
  denial of truth deep into the veins of our society. We failed to resurrect our critical thinking and became
  <br/>
  slave to the state sponsored banality of lies regarding Indian civilization, religion, history, and the idea of
  <br/>
  India. With all its fan flare and media sensualization, consecration of the Ram temple was able to
  <br/>
  inadvertently normalize the injustice suffered to the Muslim minority due to the demolition of the
  <br/>
  historic magnificent Babri Masjid structure by the Hindutva Strom-troopers. The effect is so ignominious
  <br/>
  that there was an enforced support for the Ram-temple event by the Muslim community. PM Narendra
  <br/>
  Modi’s speech on the day of Ram temple consecration on 22nd January that the birth-place of Ram has
  <br/>
  become free from hundred years of destruction directly contradicts the Supreme Court judgment on

  Ayodhya delivered on November 9, 2019. In the judgement, Supreme Court has rightly opined that Babri Masjid was not built after demolishing any standing temple, and further stated that the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 was an “egregious violation of the rule of law”. However, all the culprits in the demolition of Babri Masjid were given clean chit and extolled as great Patriots and
  <br/>
  freedom fighters by PM Modi. Lk Advani who led the Ramjambhoomi Rath Yatra movement from the
  <br/>
  forefront that resulted in ransacking of Babri Mosque and massacre of thousands of innocent lives. Such is the scale of travesty of Justice in the Brahmanical hindutva fascism. While fascist forces were busy with their grievous hatred and divisive agenda, we all concerned citizens failed to show our moral spine in a tumbling world. We all by some degree or less were victim of this mass fascist program. This is how fascism functions in both tacit and latent manners, call it as an aesthetics of fascist techniques.
  <br/>
  With the rise of imperialism i.e., the age of finance capital, the nation- state which emerged with
  <br/>
  growing capitalism, became hurdle for the free movement of capital. However, fascism that emerged in
  <br/>
  20th century with Imperialism and the crisis of capitalism, the notion of nationalism was perceived by
  <br/>
  the fascist forces through the microscopic lens of purity of race and blood. Thus, emerged racist and
  <br/>
  cultural fascist nationalism that construct internal border and opposite binary of self and other within a
  <br/>
  nation. RSS and BJP belong to such tenets of cultural nationalism that tries to enforce single exclusive
  <br/>
  identity based on religion, language, and culture. Everywhere in the world where this chauvinistic-Jingoistic nationalism has wherever usurped to political power, it has decimated the democratic
  <br/>
  structure and inflicted severe repression on the toiling masses with the helping hand of imperialism.
  <br/>
  Following in the footsteps of Savarkar, for BJP the interest of Imperialism and the interest of hindutva is
  <br/>
  same. Hindutva pioneer leaders were in bed with the British Imperialism. Today in the name of cultural
  <br/>
  nationalism, BJP and RSS is handing over the nation’s resources to Imperialist Powers, and playing its
  <br/>
  nefarious game to impose unidimensional Brahmanical Hindutva culture. Hence, BJP and RSS have used nationalism to create rift in society and incur super-profit to corporate houses. Jingoistic Nationalism in India was a by-product of hindutva fascists since its inception in 1925. Along with PM Modi the entire mainstream media projected the construction of Ram temple as a national glory, a pinnacle of “Indian civilization”, and as an inalienable act of nationalism.
  <br/>
  With the aim of enlarging its social base and to counter the growing influence of communism, RSS took
  <br/>
  various steps among them the primary one was forming several mass organizations. In 1948 RSS
  <br/>
  founded ABVP (Akhilya Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sangatan), a student body whose primary aim was to combat the Communist influence on Indian Universities. In 1952, it formed Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram with the aim to counter the Christian organizations and the proselytization and conversions of tribals by the Christian missionaries. Behind this their main agenda was to baptize Adivasis with Hinduism. At the same time RSS formed a political party i.e., Bharatiya Jan Sangh (this was changed in to Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980) to capture political power for its Hindu Rashtra agenda, which exposed its cultural nationalism. In 1955, RSS formed Bharatiya Mazdoor Shang, a worker’s union to desiccate the Communist base among the working classes in India. In 1964, in close liaison with Hindu clerics, the RSS formed Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) which played a prominent role in forging unity among various Hindu sects that bequeathed a “centralized structure” to a hitherto decentralized religion. All these organizations were stubborn in their communal fascist movements and played a pivotal role in the destruction of Babri Masjid. Today these organizations have membership in lakh and thousands of their branches spread its tentacles all over the country. This is a serious issue of concern for all democratic and revolutionary forces at present juncture.
  <br/>
  RSS did not shy to convey its support to the Congress Party in 1984 General election as the latter was
  <br/>
  playing hindutva and communal politics far more effectively than the Congress party never with whole –
  <br/>
  heartedness followed the tenets of secularism. In a highly charged communal political atmosphere, the
  <br/>
  RSS woke up the issue of Ram temple which was in slumber for many decades. Specially for the purpose of Ram temple, Bajrang Dal was formed in the summer of 1984 in Uttar Pradesh as a militant wing of VHP. Its members were recruited from the lower castes and unemployed/underemployed youths, which became the foot soldiers of Hindutva. Within few years it had an estimated membership of 100,000 youths.
  <br/>
  With the collapse of the Soviet Russia Social Imperialism in early 1990s the Indian economy underwent
  <br/>
  in a deep crisis as Indian ruling classes were highly dependent on Soviet capital. There was a severe
  <br/>
  balance of payment crisis. This was fertile ground for the infiltration of IMF and world Bank policies in
  <br/>
  India. The entire Indian economy was opened for the foreign capital and began the phase of what is
  <br/>
  popularly known as Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization. To mask the impediment social and
  <br/>
  economic crisis, with the collision with Imperialist forces Hindutva organizations dragged the Indian
  <br/>
  masses in consternated politics. In 1989 General election, from 2 parliamentary seats in 1984, the BJP
  <br/>
  shot up to 85 seats in Lok Sabha. And after the conclusion of Ram Rath yatra, in 1991 general election,
  <br/>
  BJP was able to gather 119 seats. BJP won majority of the the seats from where the rath yatra passed.
  <br/>
  The 1991 election was one of the most expensive communal election in the Indian political history
  <br/>
  where all political parties were indulged in ugly cockfight game of communal vote bank majoritarianism.
  <br/>
  Majoritarianism and fascist communal politics of RSS- BJP led the carnage of Godhra in 2002. Communal Politics has intensified with the rise of BJP to power at the center in 2014. One thing has clearly happened in the past one decade is the hinduisation of the Indian politics. Nobody can deny this with all their political consciousness!
  <br/>
  Consecration of Ram temple has brought forth the issue of building protective shield for the
  <br/>
  fundamental notions like nationalism, secularism, democracy, and citizenship from the unbridled attack
  <br/>
  of Brahmanical hindutva fascism. But simply preparing ourselves for being a guardian for these notions
  <br/>
  that defines today the essence of being human, is at same time providing these notions a weak
  <br/>
  protection. What is required at present along with protection is undergoing critical thinking and
  <br/>
  restructuring these notions to give it more endurance.
  <br/>
  RSS machineries knows that the cultural domain is manufactured and it molds the subject for specific
  <br/>
  political goals, turns them as its political agent. By constructing as territorialized and semitized Hinduism, hindutva fascism has constructed a culture of hindutva that promise for a psychological unity among the highly diverse Hindu religion. Today we can see this effort going at a brisk pace that obfuscate other social identify like class, caste, and gender. These social identities need to be suppressed by the Hindutva forces because it poses hurdle to the Hindutva ideology as those identities builds movements cutting across religion. RSS-BJP categories citizenship with the primordial category of religion. This is exactly what Savarkar says about who are citizens of India when he pronounces that those whose punyabhoomi and Pitrabhoomi is India they only belong as a true citizen of this country. By stating on a national media that Dev se Desh and Ram se Rashtra, PM Modi has openly disclosed its agenda of Hindu rashtra to the whole world. Further, PM Modi stated that “God has made me an instrument to represent all the people of India during the consecration.” This is nothing but a fascist divine theory of rule. Hitler too cultivated such religious ardency to maintain his grip over the masses. Both Modi and Hitler, political godmen, the same fit cut from the same cloth.
  <br/>
  Mainstream left parties have welcomed the congress stand of boycotting the Ram- Temple event as an
  <br/>
  ideological stand of “Nehruvian Secularism”. Apart from the loopholes of the so-called “Nehruvian
  <br/>
  Secularism”, the parliamentary opposition parties gave a paradoxical explanation for their stand of
  <br/>
  boycotting the event of 22nd January. Congress and the left had invoked secularism and the four
  <br/>
  Shankaracharya to explain their position. This they argue make them distinct from the BJP ideologically.
  <br/>
  On one hand Congress and left parties quibble against the mixing of religion with politics, on the other
  <br/>
  hand they defend secularism by giving explanations of the religious sheers. CPI (M) in its political
  <br/>
  mouthpiece Peoples Democracy argued that “But the main reason why the charge of `anti-Hindu’ will
  <br/>
  not stick is because the four Shankaracharyas of the main Hindu Peeths – Puri Govardhana Peeth,Jyotir Math, Dwarka Sharda Peeth and Sringeri Sharda Peeth – have made known their intention not to participate in the ceremony at Ayodhya on January 22.” All those four Shankaracharya have had
  <br/>
  advocated for Hindu rashtra on main stream media in past. If such is the case congress party and the left parties have tried to show that they are no less Hindu than BJP. Aam Adami Party which is a member of the United Opposition alliance called INDIA, held religious program across 70 constituencies in Delhi just before Ram-temple consecration. All mainstream political parties were immersed in this “opium” as Karl Marx used it metaphorically for religion. It is not very difficult to predict that the theme of 2024 general election will revolve around the religion and ram-temple. There will be immense polarization of society on religious background by the RSS-BJP political machineries. We are totally heading towards a Middle- Ages under BJP rule.
  <br/>
  Ruling classes parties has utterly failed to build a secular society. Since 1950s, religions perceptions and symbols have predominantly defined the political mobilizations by the mainstream political parties.
  <br/>
  Despite of the fact that, section 123 of the Representative of the people’s act of 1951 forbids any
  <br/>
  political party or individuals to use religious symbols or religious themes as a conduct of elections. But
  <br/>
  there have been no elections in India where religious themes have not dominated the elections. For
  <br/>
  Gandhi, religion was more important than politics and he aspired to create the kingdom of God that is
  <br/>
  Ram Rajya in India. Such Hindu and upper caste biased political culture was continued by congress even after 1947. Later, appeasement of conservative Muslim clergy in the Shah Bano case of 1985 by Rajiv Gandhi and at the same time giving permission to hold rituals by the Hindutva right wing forces at the disputed Babri masjid ignited the communal flare that finally engulfed the entire nation into it. With
  <br/>
  laws pertaining to uniform civil code, CAA and NRC, Indian state under BJP has made clear its apathy
  <br/>
  even with the formal secularism as enshrined in the constitution.
  <br/>
  This hindutva state, this Brahmanical society, put in iron chains the feeble and exhausted muscles of the toiling masses. It keeps their belly half filled with 5 kg of grain and half filled with days long paltry. Even after toiling like a slave under scorching heat of summer or under the shivering cold of winter,
  <br/>
  oppressed masses of the country always remain victim of malnutrition. The social principles of Hindutva
  <br/>
  justify the colonization of India, glorifies the serfdom of the Middle Ages and the slavery of antiquity.
  <br/>
  Further, it gimmicky defends the oppression of the toiling masses and labels it as their unavoidable fate.
  <br/>
  It continues the exploitation of labour and oppressed masses at a glaring pace. It finds any democratic
  <br/>
  and secular space to be anathema to its ideology. In fact, it considers them pacifistic and unmanly, in
  <br/>
  their place it advocates centralization of power, subservience to authority and violence to terrorize the
  <br/>
  opposition forces. What we must do for the destruction of the Hindu rashtra? To answer this
  <br/>
  unavoidable question is not as simple as like breaking a castle made of glasses. But without going into
  <br/>
  the complexity of the answer, we must do what the Great Revolution of 1789 did to French Monarchy,
  <br/>
  what the Bolsheviks Party did to Tsar of Russia and what our Freedom fighters did to British colonialism

  In Milan last night there was the appointment at the columns of San Lorenzo symbolically facing the Hungarian consulate.
 </br></div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  We started in the procession through the streets of the Milanese nightlife by chanting anti -fascist slogans, attracting the attention of those who were engaged in the celebrations for the carnival.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  In the document read several times during the procession, in addition to the request for the release of Ilaria Salis, it was recalled that Hungary has issued another 14 European arrest mandates for other companions who participated in the anti -fascist event in Hungary a year ago.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  The deployment of the police was very high, but the procession paraded undisturbed to end in via Gola.
 </div>
<div style="background: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  padding: 3px 6px;">
  We participated with one of our banners to express and make our solidarity and our anti -fascism visible.

  The world of evaluation, "which was based on Marx and Engels, from an abstract opportunity to become concrete reality, are still relevant after a century and great upheavals in the world. In order to be correctly positioned in a class struggle, you need to accept this "actuality" and orientate. At the same time, this "actuality" is a remedy against reformist, revisionism, and parliamentary critics, which means capital and compromise with all kinds of dominant ideologies. It is a guarantee of trust and determination that the communist world can be created.

<p align="justify">
  In order to identify the contradictions correctly in the history of class struggle, to stick to the moments of the historical breakthrough, and being ready at these breaks was Comrade Lenin's most excellent feature of his immortality. After the death of Marx and Engels, the leadership of the international proletariat was hijacked by another International, and in the words of Comrade Stalin:
  <b>
   “
  </b>
<b>
   The season in which the parties of the second International could not take over the theoretical battle to release the international proletariat and the oppressed nations of the world due to the influence of these opportunistic and classmate Social Democrats.

   In addition to the theoretical battle, to release the international proletariat and the oppressed nations of the world, with the establishment of a communist international, she developed the dynamics of class struggle in the new season of capitalism.

  </b>

<p align="justify">
  Comrade Lenin converted a communist party and a communist international as a tool against war against the bourgeoisie by freeing the communist party and the communist international movement of the legal shapes:
  <b>
   “
  </b>
<b>
   Instead of revolutionary politics, there was a peak reindeer balcony and dry rail politics, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary compositions. For the sake of course, it was accepted

  However, they "keep in the desk box", released from the legal shapes of the battle.
  <b>

  </b>

   But a new period of imperialist wars and proletariat revolutionary battles made its way. Old combat methods proved to be obviously inadequate and ineffective against the Almighty of financial capital. We had to check the entire operation of II Internationale, the entire work method, to clean it from reindeer herding, short-sightedness, politician, dungeon, social-chauvinism and social pacifism. We had to check the entire weapon warehouse of II Internationale, to be discarded everything that was rusty and rotting, forging new weapons. Without such pre -work, there was no going to war against capitalism. Without it, there was a risk that the proletariat would be inadequately armed, even in the unarmed new revolutionary matches. This honor, the general inspection and major cleaning of the II Internationale in Ageia, fell to part of Leninism. ”
  </b>
  (Stalin, the basics of Leninism)
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Comrade Lenin, his genius, firmly grabbed the core of the conflict and realized
  <span style="color: #c9211e">
   ,
  </span>
  that the battle against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking the burden of the international proletariat, without a struggle against revisionism and opportunism, without showing the true nature of these views in theory and in practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By setting a dialectical and essential connection between the "inner battle" and the "external battle", he wore a double battle.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Comrade Lenin left us with extremely important teaching that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be distinguished from the battle against imperialism and the dominant recession against all forms. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be cleaned of revisionism and opportunism.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
<b>
   Log high in Lenin's teachings in the escalating conflicts of the imperialist system
  </b>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  The imperialist system, which Comrade Lenin analyzes in detail at the beginning of the 20th century, has survived the past period, but its contradictions are escalating and is in the cycle of unresolved antagonistic contradictions. Although the breakdown of SNTL and China -through the capitalist system The integration process prevented conflicts from exploding for a while, the law of uneven development of capitalism continued, and the inter -imperialist competition evolved to the degree of "distinction" with regional wars. This shows the crisis where the system is and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. Imperialists who longed for their crisis by transferring the burden of the system to half -transfer and deepening the robbery of the semi -transplant countries have also reached a dead end.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  One of the explosive points of the built -in problems of the imperialist system, which has evolved, in line with Lenin's definition of imperialism, is that an inter -imperialist battle that has expressed itself in a variety of forms in recent years is now a fight in regional wars. When Lenin listed the conflicts of imperialism, he mentioned the interior of the imperialist contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  We can see that development is in line with Comrade Lenin's observations regarding the nature of the conflicts of imperialism:
  <b>
   “
  </b>
<b>
   Another contradiction is the contradiction between different financial groups and imperialist powers in their fight for raw materials and foreign areas. Imperialism is the export of capital to the sources of raw materials, a fierce struggle for the monopolistic ownership of these sources, the struggle for the redistribution of the world, the struggle that new financial groups and states, search
  </b>
<b>
   “
  </b>
<b>
   Place under the sun
  </b>
<b>
   “,
  </b>
<b>
   They go with special rage against old groups and states that firmly hold on to what they have stolen. This ferocious battle between different capitalist groups is special about the fact that it contains an essential material imperialist wars, wars to conquer foreign areas. This fact, in turn, is significant in that it leads to the weakening of the imperialists between each other, usually to the deterioration of the position of capitalism, to the practical necessity of this revolution.
  </b>
<b>
   ”
  </b>
  (Stalin, the basics of Leninism)
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Russia and China, the former socialist countries that gave the imperialist system a respite with their new markets, have become the main players in the Imperialist competition, with the United States of hegemonic power. This means that the dimension and nature of contradictions have increased with the growing participation of new and strong players in battle for regional redistribution. A major confrontation with Russian imperialism invasion in Ukraine took place against this background. It is predefined that this trend will deepen and expand further away. As long as there is no direct confrontation between imperialists, areas where Jakosotia is conducted are semi -transfer and colonies. Semi -transplants and oppressed nations in the world will continue to pay the price for these wars until imperialists declare the direct war against each other.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  With this
  <i>
   the world division of a handful of imperialist nations and the majority of oppressed nations
  </i>
  - What Lenin is masterfully analyzed - deepens. The third contradiction is escalated with imperialist robbery and robbery, and semi -colonial and semi -functional countries rise to the strong wars and folk wars of national release, which shaking the imperialist system.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Similarly, with this process that imperialism goes through inter -imperialist contradictions, and between the nations and nations of imperialist countries and oppressed; All parts of the prevailing system, especially the imperialist states, are becoming more centralized, militarist and militia than ever before, smoothing the way for all fascist concepts will bring society to a similar ideological formation. This is enforced either by so -called right -wing xtremist or social democratic or liberal parties. Communists and the oppressed nations of the world, encountering the reality of the system that becomes more recently and aggressive day by day, need the Lenin Party to lead a proletariat for political power, as Toveri Lenin outlined, to organize a strong resistance against this recession. Only such a party, today, Marxist-Lenin-Maoan, can lead to a non-restored battle against the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
<p align="justify">

   Lenin's great heritage, Lenin's perception of the party: The General Staff of the Proletariat

  “
  <b>
   The revolution is not about being in dinner invitations or writing an essay, painting a painting or a jewelry sewing; It cannot be so sophisticated, so sluggish and subtle, so moderate, friendly, polite, restrained and sublime. The revolution is a rebellion, a violent activity in which one class defeats the other. ”
  </b>
  Mao Tse-Tung).
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  It is crucial how communists define existing contradictions and how they position themselves in the face of development. In one hundred years after Comrade Lenin's death, imperialists have transformed their power structures into even bigger war machines. Their army, police, secret services, etc., are equipped with unmatched abilities. On the other hand, a significant part of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionary" ignore this reality (although it seems to be awarded in theory) and are far from positioning themselves accordingly. In any case, following the ideological and practical line of mediation, which locks the working class and oppressed troops into the prevailing system, they dampen the troops' anger and act as a breakwater. As the imperialists and the power structures of the deprivation are equipped with increasingly violent machinery and institutions, it is necessary to follow the strong ideological battle of Comrade Lenin, contrary to the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionary" and "communists" are shifted further away from the reality weapons and violence. Taking the second International Opportunism of Comrade Lenin's Battle Battle as a guide to these views is one of the important tasks to do the right to Comrade Lenin in the hundred years.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Comrade Lenin defined the new type of communist party as a "proletariat war organization". This definition had become necessary due to the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process leading to the October Revolution and the Civil War that broke out of the October Revolution were concrete reasons why Lenin called the Communist Party as a "war organization of the proletariat." It is a necessity for a communist party that will lead to the liberation of proletariat and oppressed troops should be this feature when the counter -revolution is arranging itself on the toes with violence's apparators and tools and performing all these harsh massacists against the workers' and oppressed nations. The revolutionary war needs a fighting party to run it. Only fools and hardened revisionists who lean on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  “
  <b>
   Some people mock us as the "Alliance" of the war. Yes, we are the half of the Revolutionary War of the Revolutionary War; It's good and not bad, it's Marxist. The rifles of the Russian Communist Party created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. The experience gained during the imperialism period in class struggle teaches us that only the rifle of the working class and working troops can win the armed bourgeoisie and the space; In this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be changed with rifles. ”

  Mao Tse-Tung).
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  In his founding conference, KKL defined the construction and reconference of communist parties as an important task in battle for the Proletarian World Revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party, developed by Comrade Mao Tung, is in line with the understanding party outlined by Toveri Lenin, and also by Stalin enriched by Stalin, and is the implementation of the Leninian understanding in the ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions, where we live in a communist party that is capable of opposing the growing aggression of imperial imperialist recession and leading the proletariat and oppressed nations of the world must be a feature of the "proletariat war organization".
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Lenin's essential inheritance is about political power as a basic issue for every revolution. Lenin showed how
  <b>
   “
  </b>
<b>
   The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois machinery and without replacing it with a new
  </b>
<b>
   “
  </b>
  and how
  <b>
   “
  </b>
<b>
   All without power is an illusion
  </b>
<b>
   ”
  </b>
  . Under the personal leadership of Lenin, the world's first socialist, proletariat's state of dictatorship was established, in concrete the power of the proletarian road and its preservation.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  After Lenin's death, his successor Stalin, who brilliantly defined Leninism, further developed it, and made it the basis of the entire international communist movement. Based on the shoulders of the Great Lenin, President Mao was able to promote the proletarian world revolution to greater heights and develop the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism, which is today Marxism-Leninism Maoism, has to embrace today, defend and apply.
 </p>

  As a KKL, we will continue to perform the tasks raised by Lenin and use the legacy of Comrade Lenin well.

 In an interview with the specialized site Israel Defense, Lieutenant Colonel Steven, an officer in force at the third fleet of the Israeli Navy, specified that the unit deployed in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Gaza can count on 15 missile corvettes of the SA class' ar, "models 4.5, 5, and 6, the latest arrivals and that
 <b>
  "Most of the weapon systems were produced by Israeli industries, except 76mm cannons, which were produced by the Italian company Oto Melara instead".
 </b>
<p>
  The Israeli colonel:
  <b>
   "Used cannons to fire on Gaza"
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  "We have been at war for four months now and already three weeks after the start of the fighting we participated in the battle with a double mission: surveillance and fire".
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   The Israeli Navy patrols the coasts of the Gaza Strip, as well as the northern coast of Israel and the Red Sea.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  What are the Oto Melara 76/62 cannons provided by Italy in Israel
 </p>
<p>
  Antonio Mazzeo explains this to Fanpage.it: "The Oto Melara 76/62 are multi -rinse cannons produced by the group of the same name
  <b>
   Leonardo Spa with headquarters in Rome and plants in La Spezia and Brescia.
  </b>
  These war instruments are characterized by a very high shooting cadence, especially in the super quick version (120 shots per minute), for the anti-aircraft and anti-missile 'defense' and the naval and coastal bombing. Their maximum range varies from 9 to 20 kilometers away. They have a very high fire capacity thanks to the different types of ammunition used (perforating, incendiary, fragmentation, etc.), against short -range missile systems, planes, ships and terrestrial objectives ".
 </p>
<p>
  Specifically, Mazzeo continues, "the 76/22 Oto Melara cannons Armano the four launches corvettes of the Sa'ar-6 'Magen' class delivered by Germany to the Israeli Navy at the end of 2020, currently used in war operations against Gaza. The same Italian production cannons were provided to Israel to arm other missile naval units, such as the Sa'ar 3 Class, purchased in France in the late 1960s; Le Sa'ar 4, produced starting from 1973 in Israeli shipyards ; Le Sa'ar 4.5 Class, also launched by the Israel Shipyards Ltd. group and used to bomb the South of Lebanon in the two-year period 1984-85 ".
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   What Italian weapons and technologies is employing Israel in Gaza
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   In the last ten years the collaboration between the Italian and Israeli military industrial complex has been Florida.
  </b>
  "The major war industries of the two countries-explains Antonio Mazzeo again-have promoted countless co-production programs and even a merger of financial capital to establish themselves in the international weapon market. Only in the three-year period 2019-2021 did the Italian government issued to national authorizations to the transfer of weapons to the Israeli Armed Forces for the
  <b>
   total value of 80 million euros
  </b>
  . The largest deal, however, dates back to 2012 when Israel purchased 30 M-346 'Master' products in Venegono Inferiore (Varese) in the factories of Leonardo/Finmeccanica spa.; The aircraft were assigned to the 102nd Air Force Squadron stationed in the Hatzerim base to prepare the drivers at the helm of new generation huntbubeders, but were also used for ground attacks with bombs and air -ter or antinave missiles ".
 </p>
<p>
  The Italian Air Force - adds the expert - "instead purchased two sophisticated Caew light aircraft based on the Jet Gulfstream G550 platform developed by the American Aerospace Gulfstream, specially modified and enhanced by Elta Systems Ltd, a group of group IAI - Israel Aerospace Industries.

 Libya is "non -safe port" and facilitating the return of migrants to the Tripoli authorities is a crime. Now there is a definitive sentence, which will have consequences on the processes and investigations in progress, as well as repercussions on political choices. The Court of Cassation confirmed the sentence for the commander of an Italian tug that had rescued 101 migrants and then entrusted them to a Libyan patrol boat.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Receiving indications via radio from an official never identified by a private company, also remained unknown to the investigations, and of which the captain never wanted to reveal the identity, the tugboat instead of heading towards Italy took the Libya route where "He brought back the 101 shipwrecked shipwasters, making them translative on a Libyan patrol boat, providing them with serious damage, consisting of their collective rejection, as a conduct prohibited by international conventions".
 </p>
<p>
  For the maximum court, performing this order means illegally rejecting migrants and forcing them to land "in a non -safe port", due to the high risk of being "subjected to inhuman or degrading treatments in detention centers for foreigners".

   a recent statement
  </a>
<em>
   from the Front for the Defense of the Struggles of the People in Ecuador.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Seed [The President of EL Salvador] is a member of a generation that comes from the rubble of an internal conflict recreated by the Revisionism of the FMLN [Frente Farabundo Marbundo Martí for La Liberacón Nacional – Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]; The Paramilitism of Arena [Alianza Republican Nacalonist – Nationalist Republican Alliance] and the US Mercenaries in the 80’s of the last century.
 </p>
<p>
  As expected, with the capitulation of the FMLN, many guerrillas and paramilitaries, without a political direction and bearers of an outdated ideology, began to form criminal gangs, either in the streets, like those who were absorbed and domesticated in the Assembly or in the struggle to take control of the old bureaucratic big-landlord State.
 </p>
<p>
  That is to say, the genesis of violence, internal gangs, hitmen, etc., responds to structural problems, but it also goes hand in hand with an entire failed political process that generated uncontrolled and at the same time functional violence, like what happened in Ecuador.
 </p>
<p>
  Obviously, the masses became disenchanted with the FMLN leadership that “took out its nails”, became bureaucratized and became another component of that bureaucratic bourgeoisie that longed to be close to the state apparatus to reproduce itself politically and economically. It was no different with ARENA and the far right, a bunch of thugs of the comprador bourgeoisie closely linked to the repressive and intelligence apparatuses of imperialism. In that scenario, any newcomer, regardless of his class origin but with a good political narrative refreshed by postmodernism and the needs of imperialism for that country and the region, was going to penetrate a society betrayed by the guerrillas and the bloodily beaten by the comprador bourgeoisie, and they created the conditions for a young man, with fascist pretensions, to assume the presidency, developed a political and economic program very close to fascism, which, alien to a classic format, adapts to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, conflictive, with deep contradictions, where any gainer who raises the story of “peace”, “freedom” outside of the weaknesses or bankruptcy of the structure, was going to have support.
 </p>
<p>
  Bukele has been shown to the world as the new model of ruler. Young, radical, informal, decisive, bossy, irreverent and, above all, he has managed very well the discourse of “peace”, of neutralizing the gangs, of annihilating violence and placing, as he points out, El Salvador, in ” a safe country to live in.”
 </p>
<p>
  The slogan of security, above all, of classes, of contradictions, of production relations, of misery, of unemployment and bureaucratic inefficiency (except for shooting or repressing the masses), has given rise to a fate of “light dictatorship” that oppresses the people, violated bourgeois democratic freedoms and institutions and handed over strong and consolidated power to the repressive apparatus of the State.
 </p>
<p>
  However, El Salvador, in economic terms, is a disaster. It has an annual growth that barely reaches 1%, one of the lowest in America; it has the highest poverty rate in America. It has an external and internal debt that reaches no less than 85% of GDP. It owes the huge amount of $10 billion to workers’ pensions. 50% of Salvadorian people has no employment or work in informal jobs.
 </p>
<p>
  The life expectancy of men in El Salvador is one of the lowest on the continent, 66 years, women: 75 years. It is the country with the slowest growth in the region. It has the highest incarceration rate in the world, incredibly 1.6% of the population is detained in prisons. The educational system at all levels is critical, lacking adequate infrastructure, but it has the most modern prisons in the region. Not only that, it “exports” its prison model to other countries, like ours.
 </p>
<p>
  El Salvador, like Ecuador, their States are parasites of remittances. The contribution made by the millions of Salvadorians who emigrated to the US is on the order of 26% in relation to GDP. A brutality, without a doubt.
 </p>
<p>
  That is to say, there is a crisis of bureaucratic capitalism and its old State, but they have an important sector of the population imprisoned; which, in addition to having been observed for the permanent violation of human rights, has given rise to a new generation of boys and girls who do not live with their parents, either because they are prisoners or have emigrated to the United States. Can we hope that this will not generate a new army of violent people in the short term?
 </p>
<p>
  In Ecuador they sell us the idea that the “bukele” model is the one we should follow; What’s more, they compare Daniel Noboa with Bukele; They compare him as his successor, or worse still, his “double.” In fact, Noboa tries to copy his irreverent style, and the first thing he did was go out to chase and imprison low-level criminals, but also tattooed boys, young people who pass by on the corners in poor neighborhoods; where being poor is already a stigma to be attacked, detained and prosecuted as a terrorist. Not only that, he wanted to go “live” by declaring war material as scrap metal and handing it over to the US, putting the country in an international crisis due to the responses issued by Russia.
 </p>
<p>
  It must be understood that all these government models aim at three specific objectives: strengthening the Yankee imperialist presence in our countries, currently weakened by the lack of response from their allies in Ukraine and, to some extent, in Gaza, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Iran. Recover or strength bureaucratic capitalism in third world countries, mainly in America, its “backyard”, to avert the revolution and further corporatize the masses and people, putting presidents and servile lackey authorities in front to the US and that they can show themselves “firm”, “determinant”, regardless of whether they explore or engage in fascist behavior, in the end, the propaganda machinery of imperialism knows, to a great extent, how to manage and manipulate the consciousness of the masses.
 </p>
<p>
  Bukele and Noboa are parasites of the US; They are fascists on the rise and must be fought accordingly!

   recent statement

<em>
   from the Front for the Defense of the Struggles of the People in Ecuador.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Military intelligence detects a drug collection center. 22 tons of cocaine captured. Record drug confiscation in the country! They say that that capture has been the product of intelligence work; however, something is very bad. The drugs are seized, but only the caretaker of the property is captured. If it was “intelligence” work, why wasn’t the gang that owned it captured? Because, like the famous “armed takeover” on channel 10, it is a hoax, a circus that has a background, a specific objective.
 </p>
<p>
  What were these false positives for? First: to declare state of commotion and internal war, thus justifying all the constitutional changes demanded by the banana big-landlord government. Furthermore, at that time, the US military delegation was already on its way. With that capture of cocaine, everything that the US had been proposing was going to be accepted. Everything that the US orders will be applied. Military forces, technology, not only this but the presence of members of the FBI is also reinforced to enhance processes of “searching” in the country; the visit of the US vice-secretary for Anti-Narcotics and… What comes next? Military bases and we will end up being a colony of the USA.
 </p>
<p>
  They manage our currency, the dollar; It’s not ours! They have eroded the economic structure of the country, we are a subjugated and oppressed country to Yankee imperialism, fundamentally; the USA; they control the prosecutor’s office, the president, the Armed Forces and police. The Assembly has relative independence, although the majority is pro-Yankee. They have just given way to the 13% increase in VAT (surely Noboa, due to his powers and inaction of the Assembly, raises it to 15%). Regarding the consciousness we are deeply contaminated, whether from the productive/commercial structure to the manipulation of the media. What it’s left to be a colony? Very little, obviously, as long as we allow it.
 </p>
<p>
  The main contradiction that has been dealt in the country has been masses-feudality; However, in recent months, given the levels of penetration of Yankee imperialism, the main contradiction is giving way to a new one that is above all, but equally, intimately articulated to the remaining ones (masses-feudality, big bourgeoisie-workers):
  <strong>
   nation-imperialism
  </strong>
  ; In that sense, strategy and tactics must be aligned to this new context.
 </p>
<p>
  The presence of the imperialist delegation in the country is not for free, it is product of everything we lived. We always said it. Gang violence is functional for the State and imperialism. Now, what we are living and what the government is doing confirms it again, everything is clear.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, they have us, with a circus, living a “false war”, where of one side is the State and its repressive apparatus, not at all professional, by the way, and on the other, corner thieves, stoners, chamberos [Translator’s note: human traffickers], arranchadores [Translator’s note: thieves], and not only that, ordinary people who, because they live in a poor neighborhood where, at style of the fascist Bukele, it is enough to have a tattoo or not respect the Emergency State, is captured, outraged, humiliated and imprisoned, in the name of terrorism. The so-called “Phoenix Plan” has become the “rulay plan”
 </p>
<p>
  Like a big idiot, the vice-president, “exiled” by the government in Israel, she reports that she has managed to get 25,000 jobs in that country. What they cannot generate in Ecuador, they want to sweet-talk us to another country where, our young people, with all certainty, will end up in the devices repressive of Zionism, they will end up being Nazified and sent to assassinate boys and girls in the Gaza Strip, Yemen, Syria or any other country in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  The government and its consort, the press, have sold us the idea that the violence is only expressed in hitmen, vaccines, drug trafficking, robberies, etc., etc., but no, it is also shown in homes where services are lacking basics, where there is hunger, illness, lack of medical care, resources, transportation, work. The same official sources report that 10% of Ecuadorians live in extreme poverty, with incomes less than 50.75 dollars per month, that is, they live with just 1.7 dollars per day. Information made up, manipulated, but, even so, it is dramatic.
 </p>
<p>
  How much longer must we wait for our people to react? Are we going to allow the indigenous, union and popular leadership to continue keeping people’s organizations hostage?
 </p>
<p>
  There are those who say: we are going against the State, the government and the imperialism. But with whom? Ah, with the masses; correct, but who have them shackled, trapped, slept, stabled, corporatized? Revisionism and opportunism. So, we see that the task is bigger, more than it seems. It is not enough to combat those who oppress us, it is important to neutralize and combat those who collaborate with fake people’s flags and even pseudo-revolutionary flags.
 </p>
<p>
  If we do not combat revisionism, we will have done nothing!
 </p>
<p>
  There is police and military takeover of the class-conscious element and of the people. Dozens of revolutionaries are pressured, monitored, intimidated and persecuted under the pretext of the Emergency State and the “internal war”. Is it a reason for inaction? No! Impossible! We must reorder forces, organize ourselves, as the central slogan of the FDLP-EC says for the period, we must
  <strong>
   organize,
  </strong>
<strong>
   combat
  </strong>
<strong>
   and resist!
  </strong>
  If we don’t do that, well, imperialism will be all-around us, the government will approve whatever they want, the Armed Forces will consolidate the extraordinary powers that they has been granted by the government and the country will end up being taken over entirely by the USA.

  Meanwhile, imperialism, mainly Yankee, continue to support the Zionist aggression while hypocritically announce their concern or conversations with Netanyahu for the disproportionate use of force or due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The reality is that Yankee imperialism

  <a href="https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/israeli-military-sites--settlements-under-gaza-resistance-s">
   continues to fight fiercely against the Zionist occupation in Gaza
  </a>
  . Actions against the supply lines of the Israeli army are reported in Khan Younis by the al-Quds brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, by the Al-Mujahideen brigades, and by the Martyr’s Brigades of Al-Aqsa. Objectives in Israeli cities such as Ashkelon have also been hit.

  The Arab lackeys of Yankee imperialism are providing help to the State of Israel and collaborating with the repression of the solidarity movement with the Palestinian people. The Jordanian people continue to protest and block the communications and supplies to the State of Israel from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that cross Jordan towards the territory occupied by the State of Israel.

  Imperialism is also deploying its offensive against solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian people that arrives from Yemen. Last month the White House decided to again call the Houthis a terrorist organization.

  in the Red Sea to combat the Houthis, a total of 700 German soldiers will be deployed at least until February 2025. The support of the Yemeni people has not languished facing the new attacks and threats of imperialism. The Houthies have recently successfully hit

  It was successfully held on Friday, February 16 at the Chania Labor Center, the screening of the documentary "Gaza Fights for Freedom" by the Resistance Initiative. A documentary that highlights the timeless struggle of Gaza residents against the inhumane and degrading exclusion of the Zionist state of Israel and the fascist type of their protest, resulting in thousands of dead and injured from 1948 to 2019. . But mainly through the words of the Palestinians themselves, he sends a message of resistance and determination that they will not stop fighting for a lighter homeland.
 </p>
<p>
  In a short position by a member of the Resistance Initiative, the need to re-enter our city the anti-imperialist movement and to demonstrate our solidarity in the Palestinian resistance, demanding that the country be not involved in the slaughter of the Palestinian people. In particular, it was emphasized that the unfolding of the anti -imperialist struggle supplies and is fueled by the struggles of farmers and students because they are struggles that oppose the policy of dependence, oppression and war.

<strong>
   With their long -term mass and nationwide uprising, the farmers forced the government to retreat and maneuver.
  </strong>
  She was forced to take back what she was saying about "motivated" mobilizations and now appear "open to dialogue". And on the other hand, along with "carrot" we also have the "whip" with the threats of Chrysochoid, prosecutors, etc. The announcements, promises and "we are open to dialogue" are "ash in the eyes" of farmers and were done under the pressure of the mobilizations. The measures announced are rural measures aimed to "deflate" the rural uprising, to break up the farm front and-in particular-to keep it away from the other racing front, the students' front and the youth that these days give Their own great struggle against private universities.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   The farmers left Maximus "with empty hands".
  </strong>
  Mitsotakis announcements are just what the EU and the anti -graduate CAP allow. The "scratching of the barrel" and the "fiscal stability" that Mitsotakis says is the anti -populist politics that impoverish the people, who destroys workers, who ends up in the poor. The measures for the EFK, the current etc do not solve the fair demands for the survival of the peasantry, to replenish lost income, so as not to apply the CAP that brings cuts to subsidies, for compensation to 100% of the losses, for prices for products and prices and prices and prices for products and prices. for income that covers the cost of life.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Rural mobilizations are fair
  </strong>
  . The major and acute problems created by the government's anti -graduation policy, the CAP and the European Union. A policy that year by year poor farmers, leads to abandonment of crops, deserted the villages, captivates the poor, brings the gathering of land and production by neo-cliffs and neo-cigarettes and deepen the country's nutritional dependence.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   The races can win! Farmers can win!
  </strong>
  Continuing and escalating the race. With a common front with the other parts of the working people and youth. The many streams of rural uprising can and should become a large river. And this river can swell more if it unite with the other large river of youth and workers and drags anti -populist and anti -anti -anti -anti -anti -anti -rush policy.

<strong>
    introduction
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The "Milei phenomenon" has surprised own and others. That is why I understand that we must redouble efforts in your research. In this text I try to provide some elements for the analysis of the phenomenon and its alliances. It is already impossible to cover everything in a single text and in turn even what outlines here requires a deep research and analysis. All this must do so in a period of great struggles where Argentina is being
   <em>
    row
   </em>
   For the government of Milei, with the Argentines inside and in a world where the crisis of the capitalist system and the inter -imperialist dispute were aguded more and more.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    II. About the State and the class struggle
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The role of the State and even its own existence has been put into discussion in the world especially after the sharpening of the crisis of post-pandemic capitalism of COVID 19. The capitalist state that is apparently based on the development of individual freedoms He has necessarily had to restrict those "freedoms" (mainly circulation and work). This contradiction, in this phase, accelerated the crisis of legitimation that has occurred to the beat of its overproduction crisis cycle.
   <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">
<sup>
     [1]
    </sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
   This phenomenon appears as novel, but it is not, the criticism of the existence of the "State" as a pillar of the capitalist system has been as many years as the birth of it. We can read writings from the anarchism of Proudhon, Marxism, European liberalism (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, etc.), American liberalism (Thoreau, Murray, etc.), among other theories. While this article exceeds, it is important to study them to understand the theories that exist behind phenomena. Many present themselves as an exit response to the crisis, but they are class collaborationists as it happens with Proudhonian anarchism or liberalism.
  </p>
<p>
   I will analyze the issue proposed from Marxist philosophy (which in my opinion is adequate to analyze capitalism), so I will start from historicism.
  </p>
<p>
   Now, taking up, in the history of humanity there was not always the "state", as Lenin develops:
   <em>
    "... the State appears in the place and at the time the division of society arises in classes, when the exploiters and exploited appear"
   </em>
<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">
<sup>
     [2]
    </sup>
</a>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The State is then the necessary tool for the domination from one class to another, it has been with the slave state (owners of slaves and slaves), then in feudalism (landowners who own servants and servants servants) and finally in capitalism (bourgeoisie and proletariat).
  </p>
<p>
   The State can occur from various political forms of organization: a monarchy, a republican democracy, etc., however it is still that machinery of domination from one class to another. The class struggle is inherent in its existence, thus the oppressed class (today the proletariat) struggles to "free itself." In that fight the revolutionary processes are born.
  </p>
<p>
   It is for that "class oppression" that the slogan of "freedom" has existed as a key in each revolutionary process. However, it is the ruling class, the bourgeoisie, which has made use of that proclaimed freedom. For example, in the capitalism "Flag of Individual Freedoms", the only usufructed freedom has been that of the owners of the land and the means of production.
  </p>
<p>
   This appearance of enjoyment of individual freedom has been discovered throughout the world with the actions of the states in the Pandemia of Covid 19. During a short term the capitalist states have had to undress as the monopoly of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of force (through police and law).
  </p>
<p>
   I say that
   <em>
    has never been seen
   </em>
   , because speed in information has allowed observing the scope of the phenomenon at the same time worldwide.
  </p>
<p>
   Given this repressive action of the (assumptions) "freedoms" arise, which are also exploited by the ruling classes.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    "... Freedom is a great word, but the flag of freedom of industry has made the most plundering wars and under the flag of freedom of work the workers have been stripped"
   </em>
<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">
<sup>
     [3]
    </sup>
</a>
<em>
    .
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
</em>
   I emphasize the assumption of these freedoms because they are only in appearance if we understand that the role of the State is the control of the domination from one class to another.
  </p>
<p>
   The capitalist system has evolved from the analysis of "the capital" that Marx made, in what Lenin
   <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">
<sup>
     [4]
    </sup>
</a>
   It has theorized, as its upper phase: "Imperialism." There we can see how capital developed: the monopolistic concentration of production, the financing of the economy with the creation of the financial oligarchy, the freedom of export of goods and the formation of capitalist associations in the world to territorially distribute the domination between the most important powers.
  </p>
<p>
   In all this evolutionary process the State as
   <em>
    Class oppression machinery
   </em>
   has remained.
  </p>
<p>
   However, in the imperialist phase the decomposition of the system itself appears: that class inequality arises stronger and more visible where capital is developed (United States, England, Germany, China, etc.). In turn, in dependent countries such as Argentina, phenomena of national bourgeoisies arise (in Argentina we could think of it during the first government of Perón) that in alliance with the proletariat has prevented, at a certain historical moment, the penetration of the imperialist powers in the country .
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore, when we analyze the State, we must understand its role in the class struggle, and in a country in dispute such as Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    III. Notions about the "libertarian state"
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The libertarian theory of the Austrian school, mainly developed by Murray N. Rothbard
   <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">
<sup>
     [5]
    </sup>
</a>
   who defines himself as the father of the so -called: "anarchocapitalism", developed a theory of the State where "an intellectually legitimized elite of this is born to govern to govern her apparatus for her own benefit, at the expense of the" citizens "but in a way Very sophisticated and developing policies that favor such legitimation.
  </p>
<p>
   Murray Rothbard,
   <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">
<sup>
     [6]
    </sup>
</a>
   He explains how the economic-financial elite, (refers to the Rockefeller family), “manipulates the currency and credit to defend the interests of the banking system or performs external interventions for the benefit of their own interests harming with such measures to the common citizens ” Then for the father of libertarianism there would then be two classes: a class benefited from the existence of the State and another clearly harmed.
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore, they conclude that without the "oppression of the State" (hence the anarchist dye) the oppression from one class to another is eliminated.
  </p>
<p>
   In theory, "libertarianism" does not propose the complete elimination of the State but its reduction, supported by the supposed equality between people (that is, without class distinction). The Rousseaunian state that "watches over the general interest" would not be necessary, because relations will be reduced to contracts between people. (Recall the fiction of the equality of the subjects and therefore the equal conditions).
  </p>
<p>
   The relationship between capital and labor is presented as the relationship between two subjects
   <em>
    free, equal and symmetrical
   </em>
   that decide to establish a contractual relationship from the freedom that characterizes them. It is what Marx defined how the "contract fiction." In other words, as has always happened with liberal theories, they need the ideological fiction of "free individuals" to turn them into "subjects of law" endowed with the ability to sell, freely, that unique that, dispossessed of all other property, They possess: their workforce. Fiction includes meritocratic morals that the free individual who does not have “properties fruit of his work” is because
   <em>
    It does not strive enough.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The main axiom that outlaw Murray is the
   <em>
    universal right to property of oneself,
   </em>
<em>
    "A right that everyone has for the mere fact of being human beings."
   </em>
   This revisionist theory, based on fictions and contradictions, aims to offer an exit (which is presented as innovative) to the current crisis of capitalism, without questioning the crisis or the essence of capitalism.
  </p>
<p>
   In my opinion the main debate of this liberal theory is with Marxist theories that have elements to reveal the origin of the crisis and its departure. I quote some lines of this debate, outlined by Murray:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “… The communalists of the Earth, who claim that the entire world population really owns the earth in common, they find the natural fact that before the farmer, no one really used and controlled the land, and therefore he owned her. The pioneer, or farmer, is the man who first carries natural objects without value to production and use. ” (
   </em>
   Rothbard Murray
   <em>
    , The ethics of freedom, p. 49)
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    “… Public sector abolition means, of course, that all land plots, all land areas, including streets and routes, should be in private hands, individuals, corporations, cooperatives or any other voluntary grouping of people and capital ''.
   </em>
   (Rothbard, M. (2013)
   <em>
    Towards a new freedom. The libertarian manifesto
   </em>
   . Editorial union. España. 2013. pp. 237)
  </p>
<p>
   In this way, it fiction an “original appropriation” of the Earth, where each individual concludes: he has the right to
   <em>
    "Possessing your own person and, therefore, your own work", by extension it has any property that "created or collected from the natural state of nature" that was not used or possessed
   </em>
   .
   <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">
<sup>
     [7]
    </sup>
</a>
</p>
<p>
   Synthesizing, under the appearance of universal liberation, the only visible freedom is that of the owners of the means of production and the land.
  </p>

   These ideas, as exposed in the previous section, benefit the only freedom that interests capital (that of the owner of the means of production and the land) and that in crisis time takes up their old recipes. As at that time, the landowner oligarchy governs us. In turn, it has also been applauded by the main referents of the right (and fascist) currents in the world: D.Trump (USA), J. Polonaro (Brazil), Santiago Abascal and even Huerta de Soto (Spain), etc
  </p>
<p>
   We can see, how Milei's ideas have been supported in the
   <em>
    ballotage
   </em>
   By several sectors of the ruling classes block, who will be strictly benefited from the approval of this new reform.
  </p>
<p>
   Most companies have cross -linked capitals, (between national capital groups of intermediary bourgeoisie and foreign capitals from imperialist countries, even within their controllers as with energy).
  </p>
<p>
   I mention just a few to keep them in mind, for example:
   <strong>
    those linked to American imperialism (USA) in Argentina
   </strong>
   , Gerardo Wetherhein, Eduardo Elzstain and Marcelo Midlin (IRSA y Cresud, TGS, Employ Pampa), Marcos Gaperin, Claudio Belocopitt ( Prepagas), Aceiter General Deheza (Argentina and associated with the Bunge), and Associate to USA), between others;
   <strong>
    those linked to European, Russian and Asian imperialisms in Argentina:
   </strong>
   Eduardo Eurnekian, Paolo Rocca (Techint, Tecpetrol, Northern Gas Transporter -Tgn-, etc.), Hugo Sigman (Insud Group), Blaquier/ Arrieta (Ledesma Group), Bulgueroni (PAE, flanges, etc.), Macri Group , among others.
  </p>
<p>
   In turn, in a dependent country, oppressed and disputed by several imperialist powers, therefore with great loss of sovereignty, the interests of the economic groups of the different imperialisms that have penetrated Argentina, are fundamental actors when analyzing the
   <em>
    Strategic Alliances
   </em>
   Among these countries that dispute the control of hegemony within the block. That is why we must study their movements.
  </p>
<p>
   I mention some of these groups such as: Cargill (USA), Bunge (USA), ADM Agro (USA) and ADECOAGRO (USA), Monsanto (USA), John Deere (USA) and Ford -Rural- (USA), Joe Lewis (English), Elon Musk (Usa-Tesla, Spacex, etc.), Dreyfus (France), Cofco (China), Nidera (China), Syngenta (China), Glencore (England), Shell (Blackrock, Capital Group Companies and The Vanguard Group-Use-), Benetton Group (Italy), among others.

   Before the sanction of this Law 26737, the Argentine Agrarian Federation had provided data on more than 34 million hectares of Argentine lands of productive and landscape value in foreign hands. This represented almost 20% of the country's productive area. The National Registry of Rural Lands (Law 26737) until 2015 gave more than 16 million ha., (More than 6% total of the country) in foreign hands, whose main capital is the American, (more than 2 million ha has .). For example: the Iberá estuaries have an area of one million three hundred thousand hectares, of which 205 thousand were acquired by the questioned American magnate Douglas Tompkins.

    </sup>
</a>
   , nothing can be explained only by external agents, who also act through internal actors and this also happens in society, I wonder then what happened with internal actors.
  </p>
<p>
   While there are many analyzes that we must make, in this contribution that I make I will take care of one of them: the internal factor. I understand that we must identify the

   In Argentina, what made possible the alliance between the most recalcitrant and fascist sector of the Dominant Classes block (linked to a sector of the Yankees and Israel), the intermediary bourgeoisie (associated and/or subordinated to European, Asian, and Yanquis imperialisms ) With the landowner (founder of the Argentine State)

  </p>
<p>
   Identify then if it is possible that in the inter -imperialist dispute, (aggravated by the crisis of capitalism in this phase), by the control of hegemony and mastery of strategic territories (militarily) with natural resources (mainly energy and food), this class landowner owner of the Earth (that is, the means of historical production in the Argentine economy) and of exports therefore of the necessary currencies for all Argentine industrial imports, has
   <em>
    determined to establish yourself in your possession (
   </em>
   Before the crisis of the agro -export model), taking advantage of the contradictions of this dispute (the needs of the intermediary bourgeoisie and external factors) and strategically ally with them.
  </p>
<p>
   For this, it is also necessary to analyze what is happening with the agricultural income (main exploitation of landowners) that has been increasing since the arrival of sojization to Argentina sustained and deepened by all governments.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “Soy is the main oilseed sown in Argentina, concentrating a 90% participation of the total area of the main crops of this variety (soybeans, sunflower, rapes, linen and peanuts). Since the ‘90, soybeans had been the main grain in national production undisputed. However, in recent years the soy has been dethroned from first place: in the recent past a progressive fall in the area destined for crop has been observed, being mainly replaced by corn, the latter passing to occupy the first position in production Since 2019/20.
   </em>
<em>
    In the current campaign, it is estimated that 16 million hectares of soybeans were planted, located just about 100,000 hectares below the previous campaign. The Oleaginosa remains the main crop in the area planted in the country, although showing an uninterrupted fall in the last 7 campaigns from the record of the 20.3 Mha that were sown in 2014/15. The area for cultivation in 2022/23 represents the lowest area planted with the oilseed since 2005/06 ”
   </em>
   (Year XL - No. 2094 - Special Soja 2022/23 - March 31, 2023)
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   While it is true that soybean production in recent campaigns could have been reduced (see the Rosario Stock Exchange), product of drought and other international changes, what we have to analyze is that in the country the culture with Higher planted area is still soybeans. In the 2022-2023 campaign it was 16 million ha. And it is expected for the next 2023-2024 campaign to increase to 17 million hectares, while the rest of the extensive crops such as corn for example (which had greater production in the season around 36 million tons, with an estimate of climbing to 59 million for the year 2024) is around 9 million hectares planted and the 6 million hawl. sown In other words, soy production remains the main factor of accumulation and concentration of the earth in the hands of landowners and the intermediary bourgeoisie.

   There are several analyzes carried out by the CEIA that can be consulted, as well as data from the Rosario Stock Exchange, the FADA, the agricultural censuses among other sources. To visualize it, I leave a FADA graph where you can see the participation of income in the cost structure in the production of soybeans and corn during the year 2023.

   As Ciafardini taught us, we ask ourselves if it is possible that when the interests linked to this income can be altered, the landowners derive their investments towards areas that are secondary.

   Industrial development and growth in our country is subordinated to the external sector administered by the funds collected from the exports that make the landowner oligarchy and the economic groups of intermediary bourgeoisie. The landowner oligarchy has historically promoted the primary development of the economy and not industrial development. This interest originally from this class can be seen intertwined with the changes in the economic policy of the United States and China.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    In United States
   </strong>
   The change in the country's economic policy has been relaunched, projecting an industrialization policy based on the energy level of military potential and communications. In a publication from the mid -2023 you can see how the JP Morgan analyzes and explains this policy change, I quote some paragraphs to observe the change:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
</em>
<em>
    “However, the wars eventually resurfaced. Russia attached to Crimea in 2014 and invaded Ukraine in 2022. In 2021, China tested a hypersonic missile system capable of evading US defenses.6 Governments began to question globalization through a national security lens and Advanced economies began to realize that GDPs mainly on services are vulnerability. "
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
</em>
<em>
    “The recent political initiatives in the US are aimed at reducing the participation of services in GDP and increasing the industrial capacity of the nation. Politically, there is a bipartisan consensus that it is a necessity. ”
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    “With regard to basic energy transition products, currently, China dominates the supply chains of many critical minerals. Specifically, it leads the production, refining and casting of aluminum (67% of the global capacity), the refining of lithium and cobalt (80% and 66%, respectively), and the production and refining of graphite (around 80%) , among many others".
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    “Among the energy transition actions, we prefer to manufacturers of clean energy technology above the builders of facilities and public services. We also like to invest in energy transition infrastructure, such as battery storage projects. Among the companies receiving the benefits of the Chips Law, we focus on those of semiconductors with narrow links with the United States Army

   Also, a few years ago, (post-Pandemics of Covid 19) we can observe several newspaper and business articles that warn about the changes in China's commercial policy, the main buyer of agricultural exports of the country. I quote some by example:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “However, China's great growth and economic development generated an important leap in food demand and currently a progressive change in the population's diet is currently observed with a greater demand for animal protein. Looking ahead, the China's food demand engine will come hand in hand with the greatest need for grain for animal feed and the import of meats. ” (

    I wonder: could it then, for the interests of the landowner class having unified with the demands of imperialist interests for energy and food?

<p>
   We must study who have been promoting the repeal of Law 26737 and there we can see how CAIR (Argentine Rural Real Estate) linked to the landowners of the Argentine Sojer nucleus said during the year 2023, but it is also expressing itself (since its creation - 2010 -) In the same sense, I quote:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “
   </em>
<em>
    Agrobioindustria is an essential part of society and an economic and social engine, present throughout the country. ”

</p>
<p>
<em>
</em>
   At that time and before the proximity of a possible government that promised the "elimination of withholdings", the expressions of the representatives of the intermediary bourgeoisie and the landowners arise, insisting with the old claim of state non -intervention in rent, I quote some next:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    “One would expect that if the production lowers, whether due to drought or the reason for taxes, the tax pressure also falls. However, due to the tax structure that weighs on agricultural production, an adverse event such as drought, instead of reducing the weight of taxes, increases it. This is because, the tax with the greatest participation is the right of export that, by acting on the gross price, does not recognize falls in profitability ”

<em>
    “With withholdings many times it is difficult to achieve that margin. That is why we say it is unfair. Because no matter how much you invested or collected, the retention goes. In the hypothetical case that retentions did not exist, surely there would be much more. The producers would do much more. More production, more income, income tax.

   The territories in Argentina, rich in mineral, water, food resources, are located in the border area and occupied by the original communities.
  </p>
<p>
   Let's look at some examples. In 2022, Argentina produced 33 thousand tons of lithium, 5% of world production, and was located as the fourth world producer after Australia, Chile and China. There are 38 mining projects, located as you can see on the border territories.

   In turn, in relation to another resource such as oil according to the data that the company YPF publishes:
   <em>
    Vaca Muerta has enormous potential for obtaining gas (308 TCF) and has very important oil resources that reach 16.2 billions of barrels, according to the latest report of the EIA 2013, which means multiplying by ten the current ones reserves of Argentina.

<p>
   Therefore, the strategic alliance described, allows progress on the internal factor of the dependency: the control of the Earth. Thus the repeal of law that regulates the purchase of land by foreigners, sent by President Milei,
   <em>
    (based on the alleged freedom of people to acquire properties)
   </em>
   And in turn, that the current vice president of the Nation (V. Villarruel) had already presented a bill to repeal law 26,160 (of territorial survey of indigenous communities) has a strict relationship in the interests of foreign capitals in these territories.
  </p>
<p>
   Argentina is among the most productive and natural resources in the world.
  </p>
<p>
   The internal factor has been key to this alliance, but in turn as every alliance at a given time and under specific conditions. Today the alliance with the internal factor is moving at an accelerated pace. It seems that the Milei-Macri government has not only made another electoral scam to the Argentine people, but also to a sector of the intermediary bourgeoisie and landowners that has supported it.
  </p>
<p>
   The scam to the people, also became possible with a good reading of the mood of the most oppressed social classes and under alleged revolutionary slogans that would release the oppressions suffered by the State.
  </p>
<p>
   The economic and social conditions were given with a government (such as Alberto Fernández) that did not respond to the needs of the people, deepened the crisis and dependence. When compass, they created the enemy (the State) by diverting attention, in an Argentina in which the rise of struggles is still on, and the scam has been perpetrated.
  </p>
<p>
   That is why it is necessary to thoroughly study the phenomenon to understand what is happening, unite theoretical and practical knowledge. So far my first contribution to the debate under study.

American imperialism has not yet been shot down and, in addition, it has the atomic bomb. But I am sure that it will also be demolished, because it is also a paper tiger.
