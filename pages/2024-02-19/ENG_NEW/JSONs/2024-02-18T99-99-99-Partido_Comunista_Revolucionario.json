That is why I understand that we must redouble efforts in your research. In this text I try to provide some elements for the analysis of the phenomenon and its alliances. It is already impossible to cover everything in a single text and in turn even what outlines here requires a deep research and analysis. All this must do so in a period of great struggles where Argentina is being\n   <em>\n    row\n   </em>\n   For the government of Milei, with the Argentines inside and in a world where the crisis of the capitalist system and the inter -imperialist dispute were aguded more and more.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    II. About the State and the class struggle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The role of the State and even its own existence has been put into discussion in the world especially after the sharpening of the crisis of post-pandemic capitalism of COVID 19. The capitalist state that is apparently based on the development of individual freedoms He has necessarily had to restrict those \"freedoms\" (mainly circulation and work). This contradiction, in this phase, accelerated the crisis of legitimation that has occurred to the beat of its overproduction crisis cycle.\n   <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">\n    <sup>\n     [1]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This phenomenon appears as novel, but it is not, the criticism of the existence of the \"State\" as a pillar of the capitalist system has been as many years as the birth of it. We can read writings from the anarchism of Proudhon, Marxism, European liberalism (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Mill, etc.), American liberalism (Thoreau, Murray, etc.), among other theories. While this article exceeds, it is important to study them to understand the theories that exist behind phenomena. Many present themselves as an exit response to the crisis, but they are class collaborationists as it happens with Proudhonian anarchism or liberalism.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I will analyze the issue proposed from Marxist philosophy (which in my opinion is adequate to analyze capitalism), so I will start from historicism.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Now, taking up, in the history of humanity there was not always the \"state\", as Lenin develops:\n   <em>\n    \"... the State appears in the place and at the time the division of society arises in classes, when the exploiters and exploited appear\"\n   </em>\n   <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">\n    <sup>\n     [2]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The State is then the necessary tool for the domination from one class to another, it has been with the slave state (owners of slaves and slaves), then in feudalism (landowners who own servants and servants servants) and finally in capitalism (bourgeoisie and proletariat).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The State can occur from various political forms of organization: a monarchy, a republican democracy, etc., however it is still that machinery of domination from one class to another. The class struggle is inherent in its existence, thus the oppressed class (today the proletariat) struggles to \"free itself.\" In that fight the revolutionary processes are born.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It is for that \"class oppression\" that the slogan of \"freedom\" has existed as a key in each revolutionary process. However, it is the ruling class, the bourgeoisie, which has made use of that proclaimed freedom. For example, in the capitalism \"Flag of Individual Freedoms\", the only usufructed freedom has been that of the owners of the land and the means of production.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This appearance of enjoyment of individual freedom has been discovered throughout the world with the actions of the states in the Pandemia of Covid 19. During a short term the capitalist states have had to undress as the monopoly of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of the use of force (through police and law).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I say that\n   <em>\n    has never been seen\n   </em>\n   , because speed in information has allowed observing the scope of the phenomenon at the same time worldwide.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Given this repressive action of the (assumptions) \"freedoms\" arise, which are also exploited by the ruling classes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <em>\n    \"... Freedom is a great word, but the flag of freedom of industry has made the most plundering wars and under the flag of freedom of work the workers have been stripped\"\n   </em>\n   <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">\n    <sup>\n     [3]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <em>\n   </em>\n   I emphasize the assumption of these freedoms because they are only in appearance if we understand that the role of the State is the control of the domination from one class to another.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The capitalist system has evolved from the analysis of \"the capital\" that Marx made, in what Lenin\n   <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">\n    <sup>\n     [4]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   It has theorized, as its upper phase: \"Imperialism.\" There we can see how capital developed: the monopolistic concentration of production, the financing of the economy with the creation of the financial oligarchy, the freedom of export of goods and the formation of capitalist associations in the world to territorially distribute the domination between the most important powers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In all this evolutionary process the State as\n   <em>\n    Class oppression machinery\n   </em>\n   has remained.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   However, in the imperialist phase the decomposition of the system itself appears: that class inequality arises stronger and more visible where capital is developed (United States, England, Germany, China, etc.). In turn, in dependent countries such as Argentina, phenomena of national bourgeoisies arise (in Argentina we could think of it during the first government of Per\u00f3n) that in alliance with the proletariat has prevented, at a certain historical moment, the penetration of the imperialist powers in the country .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Therefore, when we analyze the State, we must understand its role in the class struggle, and in a country in dispute such as Argentina.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    III. Notions about the \"libertarian state\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The libertarian theory of the Austrian school, mainly developed by Murray N. Rothbard\n   <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">\n    <sup>\n     [5]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   who defines himself as the father of the so -called: \"anarchocapitalism\", developed a theory of the State where \"an intellectually legitimized elite of this is born to govern to govern her apparatus for her own benefit, at the expense of the\" citizens \"but in a way Very sophisticated and developing policies that favor such legitimation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Murray Rothbard,\n   <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">\n    <sup>\n     [6]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   He explains how the economic-financial elite, (refers to the Rockefeller family), \u201cmanipulates the currency and credit to defend the interests of the banking system or performs external interventions for the benefit of their own interests harming with such measures to the common citizens \u201d Then for the father of libertarianism there would then be two classes: a class benefited from the existence of the State and another clearly harmed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Therefore, they conclude that without the \"oppression of the State\" (hence the anarchist dye) the oppression from one class to another is eliminated.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In theory, \"libertarianism\" does not propose the complete elimination of the State but its reduction, supported by the supposed equality between people (that is, without class distinction). The Rousseaunian state that \"watches over the general interest\" would not be necessary, because relations will be reduced to contracts between people. (Recall the fiction of the equality of the subjects and therefore the equal conditions).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The relationship between capital and labor is presented as the relationship between two subjects\n   <em>\n    free, equal and symmetrical\n   </em>\n   that decide to establish a contractual relationship from the freedom that characterizes them. It is what Marx defined how the \"contract fiction.\" In other words, as has always happened with liberal theories, they need the ideological fiction of \"free individuals\" to turn them into \"subjects of law\" endowed with the ability to sell, freely, that unique that, dispossessed of all other property, They possess: their workforce. Fiction includes meritocratic morals that the free individual who does not have \u201cproperties fruit of his work\u201d is because\n   <em>\n    It does not strive enough.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The main axiom that outlaw Murray is the\n   <em>\n    universal right to property of oneself,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    \"A right that everyone has for the mere fact of being human beings.\"\n   </em>\n   This revisionist theory, based on fictions and contradictions, aims to offer an exit (which is presented as innovative) to the current crisis of capitalism, without questioning the crisis or the essence of capitalism.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In my opinion the main debate of this liberal theory is with Marxist theories that have elements to reveal the origin of the crisis and its departure. I quote some lines of this debate, outlined by Murray:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <em>\n    \u201c\u2026 The communalists of the Earth, who claim that the entire world population really owns the earth in common, they find the natural fact that before the farmer, no one really used and controlled the land, and therefore he owned her.

(2013)\n   <em>\n    Towards a new freedom. The libertarian manifesto\n   </em>\n   . Editorial union. Espa\u00f1a. 2013. pp. 237)\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In this way, it fiction an \u201coriginal appropriation\u201d of the Earth, where each individual concludes: he has the right to\n   <em>\n    \"Possessing your own person and, therefore, your own work\", by extension it has any property that \"created or collected from the natural state of nature\" that was not used or possessed\n   </em>\n   .\n   <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">\n    <sup>\n     [7]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Synthesizing, under the appearance of universal liberation, the only visible freedom is that of the owners of the means of production and the land.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    IV. He\n    <em>\n     Rehearsal\n    </em>\n    Argentinian. The internal factor of the dependency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The president -elect, Javier Milei, who self -perceives\n   <em>\n    libertarian,\n   </em>\n   has been the spokesman of a\n   <em>\n    covert constitutional reform\n   </em>\n   prior dictation of a DNU where it takes up the legal bases of the country of the late nineteenth century, the beginning of the 20th century\n   <a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">\n    <sup>\n     [8]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   These ideas, as exposed in the previous section, benefit the only freedom that interests capital (that of the owner of the means of production and the land) and that in crisis time takes up their old recipes. As at that time, the landowner oligarchy governs us. In turn, it has also been applauded by the main referents of the right (and fascist) currents in the world: D.Trump (USA), J. Polonaro (Brazil), Santiago Abascal and even Huerta de Soto (Spain), etc\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We can see, how Milei's ideas have been supported in the\n   <em>\n    ballotage\n   </em>\n   By several sectors of the ruling classes block, who will be strictly benefited from the approval of this new reform.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Most companies have cross -linked capitals, (between national capital groups of intermediary bourgeoisie and foreign capitals from imperialist countries, even within their controllers as with energy).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I mention just a few to keep them in mind, for example:\n   <strong>\n    those linked to American imperialism (USA) in Argentina\n   </strong>\n   , Gerardo Wetherhein, Eduardo Elzstain and Marcelo Midlin (IRSA y Cresud, TGS, Employ Pampa), Marcos Gaperin, Claudio Belocopitt ( Prepagas), Aceiter General Deheza (Argentina and associated with the Bunge), and Associate to USA), between others;\n   <strong>\n    those linked to European, Russian and Asian imperialisms in Argentina:\n   </strong>\n   Eduardo Eurnekian, Paolo Rocca (Techint, Tecpetrol, Northern Gas Transporter -Tgn-, etc.), Hugo Sigman (Insud Group), Blaquier/ Arrieta (Ledesma Group), Bulgueroni (PAE, flanges, etc.), Macri Group , among others.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In turn, in a dependent country, oppressed and disputed by several imperialist powers, therefore with great loss of sovereignty, the interests of the economic groups of the different imperialisms that have penetrated Argentina, are fundamental actors when analyzing the\n   <em>\n    Strategic Alliances\n   </em>\n   Among these countries that dispute the control of hegemony within the block. That is why we must study their movements.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I mention some of these groups such as: Cargill (USA), Bunge (USA), ADM Agro (USA) and ADECOAGRO (USA), Monsanto (USA), John Deere (USA) and Ford -Rural- (USA), Joe Lewis (English), Elon Musk (Usa-Tesla, Spacex, etc.), Dreyfus (France), Cofco (China), Nidera (China), Syngenta (China), Glencore (England), Shell (Blackrock, Capital Group Companies and The Vanguard Group-Use-), Benetton Group (Italy), among others.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   At the time of monopolies and capital export, the character of international trade has changed from the moment the international business movements begin to acquire great importance, international trade (export of capital and export of goods) begins to corporate Those movements\n   <a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">\n    <sup>\n     [9]\n    </sup>\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n   </strong>\n   The repeal of economic, financial regulation standards, among others, are not a novelty in Argentina.

The National Registry of Rural Lands (Law 26737) until 2015 gave more than 16 million ha., (More than 6% total of the country) in foreign hands, whose main capital is the American, (more than 2 million ha has .).
