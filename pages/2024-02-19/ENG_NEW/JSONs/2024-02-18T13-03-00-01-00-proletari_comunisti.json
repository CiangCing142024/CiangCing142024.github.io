El Farhane also appears to have lived in Palazzolo for a couple of years, and it seems to have moved to Bergamo recently. Ditto the other workers. \"They worked for a construction company in Chiari left in the team every Monday morning to go away to work and went home on Friday evening\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"My uncle - says a nephew of Haidar - was a good person, he worked hard to send his money necessary to live to his wife and two children in Morocco\"; he complained that the employer was in\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n delay with payments.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Mohamed El Farhane, Moroccan 24 years old, and his compatriot Taoufik Haidar, 43 years old, the irregular workers Italy.

By now the companies that win the contracts do nothing but organize the work, at most they carry out 5 percent, otherwise subcontract to a network of companies. Subcontracting is equivalent to exploitation, and is often the common denominator of the massacres at work \u00bb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The client company and the contractor of the collapse in the Esselunga construction site in Florence are the same as the accidents that occurred in the construction site of another supermarket of the Lombard Group of the GDO in Genoa, in the San Benigno area that took place on February 10, 2023 in which three workers were Wounded due to the failure of a parking ramp for the use of the new Esselunga: La Villata spa, the real estate 100% participated by Esselunga, and AEP, building activities Pavesi, based in Pieve del Cairo (Pavia).\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "Exploitation, low and late wages, perhaps 2 of the workers even without contract and insurance.
