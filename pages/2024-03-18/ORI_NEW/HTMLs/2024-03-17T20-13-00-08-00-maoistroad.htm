  Solidarity with Ghassen ben Khalifa, Tunisian journalist and militant
for the Palestinian cause!
 </p>

 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Saied's Tunisian police state regime continues to persecute the
political and social militant for the Palestinian cause, the
journalist Ghassen ben Khalifa, through constructed accusations.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Already in the summer of 2022, Ghassen had been accused of managing a
Facebook page linked to Islamist radicalism and therefore accused of
terrorism, this accusation immediately appeared as a blatant
fabrication given that Ghassen is notoriously a militant of the
revolutionary left.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Incidentally, it was the first case of judicial persecution against a
revolutionary militant since the Ben Ali regime; not even the
post-revolt restoration governments, better known with the misleading
formula of "democratic transition" (2011-2021), had
prosecuted left-wing militants.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  After five days of detention and a large demonstration of solidarity
in Tunis in the middle of summer, Ghassen was finally released from
prison but the judicial proceedings had not yet been closed.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Court hearings followed in which the real manager of the offending
page declared each time that he himself was the manager of the pages
and the author of the publications and that he did not know Ghassen.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Meanwhile, the accusation of "offending others through social
media" and "participation in a terrorist plot" and
"offensive conduct towards the president" was also added.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Last March 14, the judge of first instance of the court of Ben Arous
(Greater Tunis area) sentenced Ghassen to 6 months of imprisonment,
not with immediate effect pending a further hearing which involves
the examination of the most serious charges for next April 5th.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Our party expresses sincere solidarity with comrade Ghassen Ben
Khalifa, denounces Saied's reactionary police state regime supported
by imperialism, including Italian imperialism today represented by
the neo-fascist Meloni government.
