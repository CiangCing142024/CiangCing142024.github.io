He did not find, Glory be to God, that\npage was clever and linked it to me) as a conclusive argument\nstronger than a confession.

This was proven false by the\ndefense team, based on the archive of his contacts on his personal\npage (which prove that at the alleged time of the technical\nmonitoring process, he was connected to his personal page with a\ndifferent IP address), and the confessions of the page moderator who\nwas suspended before the release of Ghassan bin Khalifa in September\n2022, and who He denied knowing the companion or having any\nrelationship with the aforementioned page, which he confirmed that he\nmanaged alone.\n  </p>\n  <p align=\"justify\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n   We,\nin the Tunisian campaign to boycott and oppose normalization with the\nZionist entity, condemn this unjust ruling against our comrade and\ndeclare our absolute support for him.
