   On the courage and dignity of the Palestinians who "inspired the rest of the world"

 <p class="has-text-align-center">
  On March 7, a "United Workers United Meeting was held in New Dehli 
 against apartheid and genocide in Gaza "to which the great writer 
 Arundhati Roy sent his position that ends 
 Like this: "
  <b>
   The Palestinians, who face the most countries 
 Powerful in the world, they suffered in an immeasurable way. But they have 
 Won this war. They acted with courage and dignity they have 
 Inspired the rest of the world
  </b>

 <p>
  Here are some passages of his message:
 </p>
 <p>
  “The richest and most powerful countries in the western world finance openly and praise the genocide committed by" Israel "in Gaza.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Gaza strip has turned into a concentration camp e 
 Those who have not actually been killed are starving.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the highest world court considers that almost every indicator 
 seem to satisfy the legal definition of genocide, the soldiers 
 of the Israeli army continue to publish "Video of Victory" 
 satyricals in which they celebrate with almost satanic rituals, and believe that not 
 There is a strength to the world who can consider them responsible.
 </p>
 <p>
  Racism is obviously the cornerstone of any act of 
 genocide. The rhetoric of the high officials of the Israeli state has 
 led to the inhumanization of the Palestinians and their comparison with 
 The insects, just as the Nazis inhumanized the Jews.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our Prime Minister [Modi] is a dear friend of Benjamin Netanyahu 
  And there is no doubt about his sympathy [for the work of the genocidal government 
  by Israel].
 </p>
 <p>
  The Palestinians, who face the most powerful countries of 
 world, they suffered in an immeasurable way. But they won this 
 war. They acted with courage and dignity that inspired the rest 
 of the world."
