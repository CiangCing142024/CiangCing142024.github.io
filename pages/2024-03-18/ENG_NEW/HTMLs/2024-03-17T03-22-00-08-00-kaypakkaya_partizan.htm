  Marxism-Leninism's Yazan Warrior, the will of the proletaya from steel, the hope of the oppressed peoples, the fearful dream of capitalism and fascism; Josef Stalin. The Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army, who we sent off to immortality on March 5, 1953, the Secretary General of the SBKP MK (1922-1953), the Chairman of the Soviet Union Council of Ministers (1941,1953), and the Revolutionary Leader Stalin left us for 71 years.
 </p>
 <p>
  The capitalist world is in crisis. Revolutionary depression deepens. Trade wars are getting hot. The blocks become evident. Regional conflicts and power of attorney wars all over the world are heading towards great demolition wars. All capitalist country societies are polarized and drawn to the poles. Capital sovereignty is shaken throughout the earth. As the war organization and bloody dictatorship of capital, fascism is strengthened and highlighted in almost all capitalist centers. For this purpose, the capital started to re-write in history. In the former socialist countries and some former Soviet republics, the Nazis are the savior, the Nazi collaborators are turned into a national hero and the Red Army is invading. As in the case of Ukraine, even the symbols of communism are forbidden in places where the imperialists have been cashed by the imperialists.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the crisis of capital deepens, fascist aggression stands out and the values of communism are placed on the target. Revolution and counter-revolution faces every front in the global arena. The capitalist world is not sure of tomorrow. They are afraid! They're on the edge of the cliff and a step after a step. That is to attack the values of communism more than ever. Stalin, the leader of the international communist movement and the peoples of the world, has become the main target of the bourgeois in the world, especially in the recent period. As the working peoples adopted with love, the attacks of the bourgeoisie increased even more. No accusations were made on the most rope. Own
  <em>
   "In your free worlds"
  </em>
  He does not even mention the name of thinned violence and savagery and wicked the crimes against humanity with great care, Stalin
  <em>
   "Making Dictator"
  </em>
  they are trying to paint as. All propaganda tools are working for this. But each time Stalin paintings in the hands of the laborers multiply, and the flood of love for him is growing. As the revolutionary crisis deepens, the symbols of the revolution become widespread among the laborers, and the values of communism are adopted by the wider masses of laborers every day. On the 71st anniversary of his death, the Stalin name continues to live as a symbol of the international proletariat's steel will.

  <strong>
   Who was Stalin?
  </strong>
  Why was he the hero of millions of oppressed workers, laborers, women and young people? How was the bourgeoisie's nightmare?
 </p>
 <p>
  Josef Stalin was born on December 18, 1878 in Gori. He joined Rsdip in Tbilisi in 1898. In 1903, he joined the Bolsheviks. He attracted Lenin's attention with his determined stance at the Rsdip 2nd Congress and his persistent attitude in revolutionism.
  <em>
   ’’ Russia has long been divided into two opposing classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie in prosperity is our irreconcilable enemy. ’(The Party of Proletarian Classes and Proletarians, 1 January 1905, Josef Stalin)
  </em>
  <p p="">
   <p>
    <em>
     ’’ We are behind developed countries 50-100 years, we should close this gap in 10 years. Either we close it or they crush us. ’’
    </em>
    he frequently emphasized above the importance of economic development. After Lenin's death, under the leadership of Stalin, the Soviet Union's economic development and strengthening targets continued. Plannings were implemented to reach the electricity of the entire Soviet Union. Industrial production has been improved and increased. Science gained momentum, almost no one left. All of these goals were connected to each other. It was not possible to accomplish the others without doing one. New constructions, factories and fields needed millions of workers. Small -scale fields without modern equipment could not feed a huge country with an increased city population. Without the country's advanced industry, it would be insufficient in defense. The so -called peace after the first imperialist massacre
    <em>
     (Versailles Treaty, 1919)
    </em>
    The ceasefire of the looking ceasefire was only a ceasefire. It was only a matter of time to begin a new war. The Bolsheviks knew this very well. The development of the defense industry was focused on. Whatever was called. In the first 5 years, a development of 50-100 years has been shown.

      The imperialists and bourgeois powers are still trying to put on the great victory of the Soviet Union and socialism on May 9, 1945, and to trivialize the victory. For this reason, they are attacking Marxism-Leninism, the will of the proletayan, the will of the steel, the hope of the oppressed peoples, and Josef Stalin, the Chief of Red Army.
     </p>
     <p>
      May 9, 1945 is the history of the greatest victory in the world history, where socialism won against fascism, the sickle-ride red flag of the Soviet Union was erected in the German Parliament building in Berlin. It is the date when fascism was taken and lost. When the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union, it is the date when those who expect the death of socialism by rubbing their hands and their hands were disappointed. Despite the terrible costs, the Red Army saved all humanity from the scourge of fascism/nazism. This is where all the bourgeoisie to Stalin, the Red Army, to the Soviet Union. With the good word of Theodorakis:
      <em>
       Mı Don't you have any other words to tell him about Stalin, Stalingrad, Leningrad, Leningrad and the Red Army who won victories in Berlin? What would we have in our hands today if Stalin and the Red Army had not raised. Have you ever thought about this? Who would prevent Hitler from filling the world with thousands of Auschwitzs?… I know why Stalin and communism were attacked in Europe and especially in racist states. Because he defeated their beloved führers Adolf Hitler. ’’
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      Stalin is the pioneer of the oppressed peoples and proletarians, including the world, including Turkey and Kurdistan; HBDH continues to guide fascism against fascism, imperialism and capitalism. Stalin's revolutionary war and struggle is embodied today in the United Revolutionary Movement and war of the peoples. Just as we defeated fascism yesterday, we will defeat again and this time we will permanently send it to the dump of history. As the United Revolutionary Movement of the Peoples, we commemorate the Red Army Commander -in -Chief, Revolutionary Leader Stalin in the 71st anniversary of his immortality with respect and longing.

      <strong>
       To the immortal leader of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples, Stalin!
