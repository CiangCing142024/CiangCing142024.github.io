     Sending 
  A military fleet in the Red Sea in the framework of the European Mission 
 Aspides, Italy is involved in the ongoing war in the middle 
 East and becomes an accomplice of the genocide in Palestine.

       Still 
  Once Italy proves to be a servant of the state of Israel, such as 
 We saw well on January 27 and how we are seeing these days, 
  In addition to the naval mission, with arrests against activists 
  Palestinians following the request for extradition of Anan Yaeesh 
 advanced by the Zionist state.

  The population is not fully aware, government and parliament 
 Italian are totally responsible for it, having voted in favor of 
 This new military adventure that deploys Italy and Europe alongside

       THE 
  Italian military commands took the opportunity waiting for 
 time to intervene militarily in what they call the 
 "Allaroal Mediterranean", a conception that includes, in addition to the coasts 
  Mediterranean, also the Black Sea (where the war in an encouraged today 
 Ukraine), the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (where the 
 consequences of the war in the Middle East and the genocide of

 Westerners of India (where the clash between the United States and China looms) and 
  to the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa.

       This 
  Bellicist vocation was ratified by the Maritime Security 
 Strategy of the European Union of 10 March 2023, where a 
 "Direct impact on European security and prosperity" and where the EU

       That 
  in the Red Sea, as well as a mission to defend naval traffic 
 from the attacks of the Houthi Yemeniti who fight alongside the 
 Palestinian resistance, it is also a mission that aims to redefine the 
 areas of competence and control by poles and powers in

       We say 
  that the Italian and European military fleet in the Red Sea must be withdrawn 
 before the war events become a further "accomplished fact" e 
 A new front of world war in pieces that looms over the world.
       <br/>
       We intend to give life to a first event for the retreat 
 of Italy from the Aspides mission in the Red Sea and against the 
 involvement of our country in the wars and in the genocide in progress a 
 Gaza.
