  Scream "Long live the anti -fascist Italy!" Not 
  It is a crime. Indeed, anti -fascism is a value protected by the Constitution, 
 As well as protesting for what the institutions are not doing 
 for the climate. At the Mantua literature festival, an activist 
 climatic had exposed a sign with the word “But don't hear the 
 heat?". Eni was among the sponsors. In both cases the dissent 
 politician was criminalized and people have been identified. The 
  information collected are merged into the Ministry's SDI database 
  of the interior.

 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the absence of valid reasons e 
 communicated, however, there is a risk that an arbitrary form of 
 filing. And that those who are exercising the free manifestation of the 
 just thought is treated as a dangerous subject, a 
 subversive. It does not escape the consequences of this new "practice" 
 may be far worse for those who are not an Italian citizen and yes 
 finds the request of 
 citizenship. A "mere suspicion" can in fact lead to a refusal. 
 “Elements that do not allow to exclude emerged from the investigation 
 possible dangers for the safety of the Republic and for this reason 
 impediment to the granting of citizenship ". With these few words, 
 three lines without any other explanation, only a simple suspicion, the 
 Ministry of the Interior, in the last three years, has rejected the questions 
 of citizenship of hundreds of citizens

 foreigners who had the whole 
  right to acquire it. And he did it without these people having 
 never committed a crime, they had never been investigated or attributed in a 
 criminal procedure, therefore, without having a stain on their own 
 judicial box.

  Punish dissent - this is the case, for 
 example, of a 31 -year -old man who was born in Morocco but has lived from 15 years to 
  Verona. Karim (imagination name) asked to remain anonymous for 
 protect its identity and appeal against the refusal of the 
 citizenship. In the Scaliger city it is well known and esteemed, 
 especially in the university world and associations where it operates from 
  time as a volunteer and operator. It is part of the self -managed laboratory 
  Pararatodos, one of the largest social spaces in Verona who carries out 
 different social activities, such as the Italian school, it 
 Social desk, courses and cultural events. But also an important 
 place of criticism and politics from below, through the organization of 
 Square events.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  On a working and social level, 
 university professors, employees of the hospital of the 
 City, councilors and councilors of the Municipality have told that 
 Karim's approach is that of opening and collaboration, capable of 
 Approach different cultures, to build bridges. A teacher 
 of the University of Siena, who knows his work, underlined the 
 his ability to compare peaceful, altruism and civic sense, 
 calling him "a young man who is making Italy a country 
 improve". Has no precedents, nor criminal proceedings in progress and does not have 
 Never committed crimes. But the Ministry of the Interior nourishes a 
 suspicion, and Karim discovered it when one was notified to him 
 communication according to which there would be “elements that do not allow 
 exclude possible dangers for the safety of the Republic "which, 
 Obviously, they constitute an obstacle to the granting of the 
 citizenship.

 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In situations similar to his, to 
 basis of the decision there was a report by the police. For 
 This is man hypothesizes that he has been attached by the division 
 local, for the attendance and participation in the activities of the Center 
 social and for its commitment as an activist in the area in favor of 
 weaker. Yes, because these stories seem to be a step beyond the 
 criminalization of dissent through identification in banks 
  Police data whose newspaper has already given account.

 <p p="" style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   “A person who lives one is preferred 
 life home and work, does not come out and does not participate ", he continues," instead of 
 Consider a model citizen who takes part in political life ". THE 
  his lawyers, who have appealed to the TAR, point out how 
 is already an active member of Italian civil society and as 
 daily gives body to the values of the Constitution. The court 
 administrative will have four years to decide.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   Above all suspicions - yet, 
 for the Ministry of the Interior which evaluated and signed the rejection of the 
  demand for citizenship, man is potentially considered 
 dangerous. According to the dicastery, “the impedimental elements come from 
 institutionally responsible bodies to operate for the safety of the 
 state, attributable to reliable sources of which it is not given doubt, and 
 Therefore, it is not possible to further explicit the aforementioned 
 obstacle elements ". And again, the provisions of the Interior Ministry believe that 
 “The verification of the existence of reasons inherent in the safety of the 
 Repubblica does not reduce to the assessment of criminally relevant facts 
 But it extends to the area of the prevention of crimes ".
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   In other words: to see each other 
 rejected the question of citizenship is enough a simple suspicion 
 intelligence, it is not necessary to have committed any crime. Enough 
 have been mentioned in a report during an event or be part of 
  of a contestation movement, even without complaints or formal 
 Identifications. Information not known by the interested party. "I have it 
 lived as an intimidation ”, comments Karim,“ but I continued to do 
 part of the movement ".
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   Despite the appeal, then, his own 
 legali have not had any detail on the accusations made, given that 
 This kind of acts is secreted. The lawyer cannot therefore receive 
 Another useful indication to find out the motivations of the refusal and so 
 defend it as the law provides. Not only. The defense of man, though 
 recognizing the wide discretion of the Ministry of the Interior in 
 matter, highlighted that discretion cannot justify 
 "The absence of a minimum of motivational content". The decision on 
 basis of the mere suspicion, underline the lawyers, cannot degenerate into 
  free will: not to explain rigor the reasons does not mean 
 allow the person to defend themselves. The Ministry of the Interior does not have

   Are not isolated cases - according to what 
 emerged from access to the documents presented by the Study Association 
 legal immigration, “the number of instances rejected on the base 
 of reasons relating to the security of the Republic was 233 in 2020, 
  169 in 2021 and 218 in 2022 ". For 2023 the data is not yet 
 Available, but it is possible to hypothesize that the trend is followed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   The judicial authority would have the 
 task of supervising the discretionary power of public 
 Administration but in fact he does not enter the merits, limiting himself to 
 Check the consistency of the explanation given by Digos from a point of 
  logical view. Usually there are a few lines of motivation, a lot 
 generic, and lawyers not only cannot make a copy of the documents 
  of investigation - can only transcribe under the eyes of the authority - 
 But they don't even have the opportunity to oppose an exception beyond the 
 manifest illogicality. “There are evidently functional evaluations to a 
 prevention policy that, freeing himself from the commission of a fact 
  concrete, remains easily at the mercy of racial prejudices e 
 Political assessments, "say the lawyers. The fact remains that from these 
 suspects it is impossible to defend yourself, precisely because of the character 
 discretion of the citizenship measures that are 
 entrusted to the exclusive decision of the Ministry of the Interior.
