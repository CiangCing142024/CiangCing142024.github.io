  that starting from July the aviation of Ukraine could begin to 
 use the F-16 hunting in the war against Russia provided by the countries

 Waiting: the Ukrainian government asks war planes practically 
 from the beginning of the Russian invasion, and between the various Western countries the 
 Possibility to deliver to Ukraine the F-16s was a source of Grosso 
 debate.

 they are modern hunting 
 multi -row, that is, capable of both creepy targets and

  The

  Last May, Ukrainian pilots said that Russian planes 
  I am able to spot their planes and launch against them 
 missiles even before being identified in turn. In these 
 circumstances, Ukrainian pilots must be warned by voice by 
 Radar controllers on the ground of the threat and have no other choice if

  The F-16s also have some limitations that will reduce it 
 The impact on war. The former relate to their characteristics 
  techniques. As
  <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/what-it-takes-fly-f-16-challenges-ukraine">
   he remembered
  </a>
  a recent analysis of the Council on Foreign Relations Study Center: «I 
 Ukrainian commanders who will plan the operations with the F-16s 
 they will have to worry about the dangers represented by debris on the slopes 
  take -off. Since the F-16s have only one engine-unlike the 
 two of the MIG-29 and SU-27-are particularly vulnerable to damage 
 caused by final take -off or dirty takeover. The F-16s are not 
 designed to operate by damaged or improvised slopes ».

  These 
  considerations are particularly important, given that a part 
 considerable of the Ukrainian aviation operates precisely by improvised bases 
 To escape the Russian bombings. The aerial bases that will be 
 used by the F-16s will in all probability will easily 
 identifiable by Russian intelligence and will need to be 
 Thoroughly defenses.

  The other 
  Large limit of the F-16s is made up of their number. Initially 
 Ukraine will receive 6 hunting, training for twelve pilots and 
 About fifty maintenance technicians on the ground. Denmark, 
 Norway, Belgium and Netherlands promised the delivery of another 33 
 planes and it is estimated that the allies have committed themselves to providing 
  A total of 60 aircraft. It is not clear, however, when it will end 
 the training of the related pilots and the rest of the earth staff. 
 It will probably take years.

  I am 
  insufficient numbers to have a significant impact on the current 
 trend of aerial war. Before invasion, Ukrainian aviation 
 he had about a hundred combat planes and 
 At the moment it is probably able to make a number not too much 
  lower (part of the losses suffered was replaced by hunting 
 Soviet manufacture donated by Poland and other countries).

  Other 
  singing, Russia on paper can deploy over a thousand planes from 
 combat and, realistically, it uses different Ukraine 
 hundreds. This situation, combined with the effectiveness of the anti -aircraft defenses 
  Russian, makes it complicated for a few tens of planes to have an effect 
 radical on current fights.

  <strong>
   So what are they for?
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Although they will hardly be able to determine the trend of war by themselves, the aviation experts
  <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/10/f-16s-are-no-magic-bullet-for-ukraine-but-they-are.html">
   they indicated
  </a>
  Some important functions that the F-16s will be able to perform. One of 
 main is their ability to contribute to the interception of 
 missiles that Russia uses to hit Ukrainian cities, providing a 
  precious help to Ukrainian aerial defenses, increasingly short of 
 missiles.
 </p>
 <p data-qr-debug="false" data-qr-elem-last-intersection-time="0" data-qr-elem-last-start="0" data-qr-elem-total-expose-time="1982" data-qr-index="12" data-qr-reading-time="9.64" data-qr-user-elem-full-visible="1">
  Thank you 
  To their modern sensors, the F-16s can "hook" (as they say in 
  jargon) Russian cruise missiles and hit them with their missiles 
 air-air (i.e. missiles launched by a plane to hit a goal in 
  flight). It is an efficient and above all economic method for 
 Defend Ukrainian aerial space.
 </p>
 <p data-qr-debug="false" data-qr-elem-last-intersection-time="1710671207526" data-qr-elem-last-start="1710671206794" data-qr-elem-total-expose-time="664" data-qr-index="13" data-qr-reading-time="11.64" data-qr-user-elem-full-visible="1">
  THE 
  Earth-air missiles (i.e. those launched from the ground to hit a 
 goal in flight) are much more complicated and expensive, since for 
 hit their target need to reach great speeds and 
  travel wide distances. Air-air missiles, on the other hand, come 
 launched by planes able to approach their targets considerably e 
  Which, at the time of launch, are already traveling at high speed.

  THE 
  NATO countries have large reserves of air-air missiles that can 
 be used by the F-16, while their missile stocks 
 earth-air are increasingly reduced.
