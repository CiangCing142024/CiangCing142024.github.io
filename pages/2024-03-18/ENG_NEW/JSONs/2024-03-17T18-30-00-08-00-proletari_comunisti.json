Since the F-16s have only one engine-unlike the \n two of the MIG-29 and SU-27-are particularly vulnerable to damage \n caused by final take -off or dirty takeover.

Initially \n Ukraine will receive 6 hunting, training for twelve pilots and \n About fifty maintenance technicians on the ground. Denmark, \n Norway, Belgium and Netherlands promised the delivery of another 33 \n planes and it is estimated that the allies have committed themselves to providing \n  A total of 60 aircraft.
