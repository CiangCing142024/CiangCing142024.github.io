Founded in 1920 by Komintern, the Red-Aida declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the establishment of the Commune of Paris, \"International Solidarity Day for Political Prisoners\" and owned it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners is demonstrated worldwide.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p p=\"\">\n   <p p=\"\">\n    <p>\n     The Indian recreational state has captured more than ten thousand communists, revolutionary and political activists such as Vice -Reserve Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilsom and Gautam Navlakha, to stop the Folk War.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been captured by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released even though he has suffered his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been captured by US imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionary and oppressed nations in the world have spent decades in prisons.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     The fear and classroom of the dominant classes towards communist and revolutionary prisoners is so great that they prevent their own laws, contrary to their own laws, and the revolutionary from leaving prisons. In order to understand the fear and hate of imperialists and the prevailing system, the assassination of Chairman Gonzalo in 2021 is very important; The PKP leader, who lost his health after 29 years of insulation and whose death was caused by not taking the necessary health measures. Those responsible for the death of the chairman Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the demands of class struggle with the threat of their lives, by trying the boundaries of prison. They refuse to capture and do not hesitate to oppose any kind of pressure, torture and insulation. We need to mobilize the prisoners' legitimate fighting and resistance to fight all kinds of aggression against prisoners, be the voice of the prisoners, we must support their struggle in imprisonment as part of a class struggle.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      Supporting communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary battle!\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      Let us make our communist and revolutionary prisoners resistance and fight for ours.
