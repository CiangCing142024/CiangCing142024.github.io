The court decided to decide Tahir K\u00f6\u00e7er for 2 years and 5 months in prison.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mass waiting outside the court for solidarity with Tahir Ko\u00e7er, protested with a press release. Ruken Ak\u00e7a, who made the statement, said, \u201cToday we have entered the hearing of Tahir K\u00f6cer. We listened to the German state once again. They say Germany is a country of democracy, but it is not. We have not seen freedom or justice. The Kurdish people want to live in democracy in Germany for 40 years for political reasons. We came here because of political problems, but we have the same problems here again. Many Kurds in Germany are kept in prisons under the excuses of Sudan. We find this decision made by the Munich State Supreme Court political and biased and protesting the decision. We will continue our struggle everywhere \u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The action ended with the slogans of \u201cfreedom to political prisoners\u201d and \u0131n Long live solidarity \u201d.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.atik-online.net/blog/siyasetci-tahir-kocere-2-yil-5-ay-hapis-karari", "type": "article", "title": "2 years and 5 months imprisonment for politician Tahir K\u00f6\u00e7er", "description": "News Center | 17.03.2024 | The National Congress of Kurdistan detained in Nuremberg, Germany ...", "author": ["muhabirhasan"], "categories": ["Avrupa", "Haberler", "Manset"], "link-section": "haberler", "source_name": "ATIK Online"}
