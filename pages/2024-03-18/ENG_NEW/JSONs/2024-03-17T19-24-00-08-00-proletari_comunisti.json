The rhetoric of the high officials of the Israeli state has \n led to the inhumanization of the Palestinians and their comparison with \n The insects, just as the Nazis inhumanized the Jews.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our Prime Minister [Modi] is a dear friend of Benjamin Netanyahu \n  And there is no doubt about his sympathy [for the work of the genocidal government \n  by Israel].\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Palestinians, who face the most powerful countries of \n world, they suffered in an immeasurable way.
