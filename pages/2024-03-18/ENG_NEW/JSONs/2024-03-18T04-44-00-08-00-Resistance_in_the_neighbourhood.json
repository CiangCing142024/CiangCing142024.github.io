Their giggling? The targeting of the place up to nuclear retaliation of hostile (for the people?) Countries (controlled by bourgeoisie?) Due to its cowardice in a military portrait of the most bloodthirsty vampires on the planet? An institutional cause, which is deteriorating, by the dreamer of the dreamer (because this remains) with the Asia Minor and Cypriot scar on her body.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n That is, those of active participation with a rifle in the front line of the Titanic Front of imperialist competitions. As well as the care of a genocide - ethnic cleansing where the inhumane lake is struggling, to exterminate more Palestinians than the Zionist fire. Or is a new landing on Chania murderous aircraft crews whose violence overcomes their porn over?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Fortunately- according to anxious journalists- the previous nightmares do not apply. On the contrary, the integration (submission) of Greece's dependent order into the \"right\" gang of international slaughterhouses and their fanatical framework (frigates, infantry decision to send business plans) defends security (one candidate Hiroshima) (The same as \"magical\" enjoy Syrianians?). So where does the fear come about?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Are earthquakes and other natural disasters with state infrastructure, inappropriate to deal with them? Is it estimated that Erdogan will attack us despite the Divine Divine (master) Sam Sam? Will poverty and precision escalate by sinking to the bottom of the misery of the majority of the population while at the same time, profanity, enrichment of capitalists? Will the suicides of any sick people lack financial resources to buy medicines and appeal to the afternoon surgeries of the ravaged (the expensive barracks as a carnivore is fed by the prey of social welfare) hospitals?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Is there a prediction of increasing the workplace \"accidents\" due to the frenzied intensification of malicious staff in tourist galleys? Over -echoing the tertiary sector (the heavy industry of ... serving!) Is the most distorted growth promoted? Do the Cretan -based Cretan in the Hard Present Thinking To Power the Wave of Pentecost? Are the peasantry and with the trick of forest capital protection, are local property? Wind turbines, photovoltaic parks, hydrocarbon drilling, electricity pillars, energy roads and other monstrous interventions in the environment are it calculated that they will harm it incompetent? Are they redeemed with homemade crumbs and is the island under foreign predatory giants?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Nothing- unfortunately again- is not the case, as the demons (here are here paid) of the printing and electronic misinformation in chords with local factors and central leaders. So the panic is unjustified? Of course not. They have already landed in the last quarter on the south coast of 1500 \"raiders\" (Raki, Tuttein), causing the inseparable. Unlike the spacious hospitality of nearly six million visitors in the summer. Oimee, flows from North Africa are magnificent.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Ironic; Those who have not been drowned with walnuts are forced or dipped by the thousand Christian crosses on the day (Pylos) in the heartfelt for the culprits and racist for the victims of the area- of the region. From where they took off those bombers, they leveled their ancestrals.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Outraged? Because our country's increasingly bold involvement in Western war adventures will give birth to new desperate caravans. Since the Memorandum Politics of the Surprise of the Liturgy Homeland Mother with the calamity of Smyrna and persecution in the distant slaves of youth are common with those of current looting -trashing and exterminating expatriates.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n A people unable to defend the refugees and immigrants, it is certainly unable to fight for their own right in bread, health, studies and peace. The progressive forces of the non -reformist left fight for the exact opposite.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n After all, no one knows what is going on. Already in the past (and in the recent even the Memorandums) we have been in their dire position. Expressing class and internationalist solidarity with third parties tortured, we build terms for our own bearable today and redemptive tomorrow.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n But there are genuine, devastating, hateful garbage that threaten us deadly. It is not the distant runners from the hell of fire or hunger, who in their impasses seek refuge in a destination of beasts. It is those criminals who live in the bases with their domestic applause, their locks.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The waste for the consolidation of society must actually be buried in the landfills of history.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n KM (Member of the Resistance Initiative)\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d."], "labels": ["\u039a.\u039c.", "\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2", "\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_40.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
