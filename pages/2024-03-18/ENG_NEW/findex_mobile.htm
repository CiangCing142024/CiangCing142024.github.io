  News Center | 17.03.2024 | A member of the National Congress of Kurdistan, who was detained in Nürnberg, Germany, and the former German Confederation of Kurdistan Societies (Kon-Med) Co-President Tahir Koçer's decision on March 15 at the Munich State Supreme Court. The court decided to decide Tahir Köçer for 2 years and 5 months in prison.
 </p>
<p>
  The mass waiting outside the court for solidarity with Tahir Koçer, protested with a press release. Ruken Akça, who made the statement, said, “Today we have entered the hearing of Tahir Köcer. We listened to the German state once again. They say Germany is a country of democracy, but it is not. We have not seen freedom or justice. The Kurdish people want to live in democracy in Germany for 40 years for political reasons. We came here because of political problems, but we have the same problems here again. Many Kurds in Germany are kept in prisons under the excuses of Sudan. We find this decision made by the Munich State Supreme Court political and biased and protesting the decision. We will continue our struggle everywhere ”.
 </p>
<p>
  The action ended with the slogans of “freedom to political prisoners” and ın Long live solidarity ”.

  Enemies, enemies, oil apart. Despite the recurring statements of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) against Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip and in defense of the Palestinian civilian population, Brazilian oil is among the most used by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to supply its airplanes and tanks Since the beginning of

  He revealed on Thursday (14) that Brazil is one of the five largest suppliers of Cru Oil to Israel, along with United States, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Gabon and Russia. The number of massacred Palestinians in Gaza already exceeds 31 thousand, 13,000 children. Other tens of thousands are injured or missing under the rubble, possibly dead, and the survivors face hunger, as Israel has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid. On the Israeli side, 1,388 people were murdered.

  Brazil, one of the ten largest oil producers in the world, has sent 260,000 tons of oil to Israel since December, when Lula had already done

  “The dynamics of the oil industry is so cruel that, even while President Lula is considered Persona non grateful by the Israeli far-right government, Brazil feeds the Benjamin Netanyahu war machine with Brazilian oil,” says Claudio Angelo, coordinator of International Policy of the Climate Observatory. "This is a problem, but it can also be an instrument of pressure from the Brazilian government for a ceasefire."
 </p>
<p>
  The material sent by Brazil in two loads - one in December 2023 and one last month - comes from Campos in the Sea of British Shell and French Total Energies in partnership with Petrobras. According to

  As an important oil supplier for Israel, Brazil has the opportunity to press for a ceasefire through a fossil fuels, used to supply the country's military fleet.
 </p>
<p>
  The maintenance of trade relations with Israel is criticized by Palestinian advocates. "States and companies that continue to provide fuel to Israel to their military forces are directly complicit in supporting their ongoing genocide," said Mahmoud Nawaja, general coordinator of the Palestinian National Committee. In this scenario, the embargo is seen as a opposition to the military power of Israel. "We appeal to nations to take advantage of oil supply as a way to demand an immediate ceasefire and the end of the occupation," said Allie Rosenbluth, program manager of

 </p>
<p>
  Historical Allies of Israel, the United States sent three fuel navies to military jet. The last of them was seen at the Israeli Port of Ashkelon on March 6. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq carry crude oil through the Sumed oil. Israel receives from this small, but constant oil remittances. These countries have also criticized Israel's stance in war.
 </p>
<p>
  The Climate Observatory questioned the Brazilian government about the sale of oil to the Netanyahu government, but did not get a return until the publication of this report.

 A few hundred people participated in Thursday's rally against Pierrakakis. Youth has shown that it is willing to continue the struggle against this law.
 <p>

<p>
  On the other hand, it was once again the scrap of the reformist left. PCs and ESAK, with their demands ("the law to stay on the cards"), but also with the absence of racing mobilizations and assemblies for the next few days, made it clear that for them the rally was simply the "closing ceremony" of the last race. two months.

  Marxism-Leninism's Yazan Warrior, the will of the proletaya from steel, the hope of the oppressed peoples, the fearful dream of capitalism and fascism; Josef Stalin. The Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army, who we sent off to immortality on March 5, 1953, the Secretary General of the SBKP MK (1922-1953), the Chairman of the Soviet Union Council of Ministers (1941,1953), and the Revolutionary Leader Stalin left us for 71 years.
 </p>
<p>
  The capitalist world is in crisis. Revolutionary depression deepens. Trade wars are getting hot. The blocks become evident. Regional conflicts and power of attorney wars all over the world are heading towards great demolition wars. All capitalist country societies are polarized and drawn to the poles. Capital sovereignty is shaken throughout the earth. As the war organization and bloody dictatorship of capital, fascism is strengthened and highlighted in almost all capitalist centers. For this purpose, the capital started to re-write in history. In the former socialist countries and some former Soviet republics, the Nazis are the savior, the Nazi collaborators are turned into a national hero and the Red Army is invading. As in the case of Ukraine, even the symbols of communism are forbidden in places where the imperialists have been cashed by the imperialists.
 </p>
<p>
  As the crisis of capital deepens, fascist aggression stands out and the values of communism are placed on the target. Revolution and counter-revolution faces every front in the global arena. The capitalist world is not sure of tomorrow. They are afraid! They're on the edge of the cliff and a step after a step. That is to attack the values of communism more than ever. Stalin, the leader of the international communist movement and the peoples of the world, has become the main target of the bourgeois in the world, especially in the recent period. As the working peoples adopted with love, the attacks of the bourgeoisie increased even more. No accusations were made on the most rope. Own
  <em>
   "In your free worlds"
  </em>
  He does not even mention the name of thinned violence and savagery and wicked the crimes against humanity with great care, Stalin
  <em>
   "Making Dictator"
  </em>
  they are trying to paint as. All propaganda tools are working for this. But each time Stalin paintings in the hands of the laborers multiply, and the flood of love for him is growing. As the revolutionary crisis deepens, the symbols of the revolution become widespread among the laborers, and the values of communism are adopted by the wider masses of laborers every day. On the 71st anniversary of his death, the Stalin name continues to live as a symbol of the international proletariat's steel will.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Who was Stalin?
  </strong>
  Why was he the hero of millions of oppressed workers, laborers, women and young people? How was the bourgeoisie's nightmare?
 </p>
<p>
  Josef Stalin was born on December 18, 1878 in Gori. He joined Rsdip in Tbilisi in 1898. In 1903, he joined the Bolsheviks. He attracted Lenin's attention with his determined stance at the Rsdip 2nd Congress and his persistent attitude in revolutionism.
  <em>
   ’’ Russia has long been divided into two opposing classes: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie in prosperity is our irreconcilable enemy. ’(The Party of Proletarian Classes and Proletarians, 1 January 1905, Josef Stalin)
  </em>
<p p="">
<p>
<em>
     ’’ We are behind developed countries 50-100 years, we should close this gap in 10 years. Either we close it or they crush us. ’’
    </em>
    he frequently emphasized above the importance of economic development. After Lenin's death, under the leadership of Stalin, the Soviet Union's economic development and strengthening targets continued. Plannings were implemented to reach the electricity of the entire Soviet Union. Industrial production has been improved and increased. Science gained momentum, almost no one left. All of these goals were connected to each other. It was not possible to accomplish the others without doing one. New constructions, factories and fields needed millions of workers. Small -scale fields without modern equipment could not feed a huge country with an increased city population. Without the country's advanced industry, it would be insufficient in defense. The so -called peace after the first imperialist massacre
    <em>
     (Versailles Treaty, 1919)
    </em>
    The ceasefire of the looking ceasefire was only a ceasefire. It was only a matter of time to begin a new war. The Bolsheviks knew this very well. The development of the defense industry was focused on. Whatever was called. In the first 5 years, a development of 50-100 years has been shown.
   </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
      The imperialists and bourgeois powers are still trying to put on the great victory of the Soviet Union and socialism on May 9, 1945, and to trivialize the victory. For this reason, they are attacking Marxism-Leninism, the will of the proletayan, the will of the steel, the hope of the oppressed peoples, and Josef Stalin, the Chief of Red Army.
     </p>
<p>
      May 9, 1945 is the history of the greatest victory in the world history, where socialism won against fascism, the sickle-ride red flag of the Soviet Union was erected in the German Parliament building in Berlin. It is the date when fascism was taken and lost. When the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union, it is the date when those who expect the death of socialism by rubbing their hands and their hands were disappointed. Despite the terrible costs, the Red Army saved all humanity from the scourge of fascism/nazism. This is where all the bourgeoisie to Stalin, the Red Army, to the Soviet Union. With the good word of Theodorakis:
      <em>
       Mı Don't you have any other words to tell him about Stalin, Stalingrad, Leningrad, Leningrad and the Red Army who won victories in Berlin? What would we have in our hands today if Stalin and the Red Army had not raised. Have you ever thought about this? Who would prevent Hitler from filling the world with thousands of Auschwitzs?… I know why Stalin and communism were attacked in Europe and especially in racist states. Because he defeated their beloved führers Adolf Hitler. ’’
      </em>
</p>
<p>
      Stalin is the pioneer of the oppressed peoples and proletarians, including the world, including Turkey and Kurdistan; HBDH continues to guide fascism against fascism, imperialism and capitalism. Stalin's revolutionary war and struggle is embodied today in the United Revolutionary Movement and war of the peoples. Just as we defeated fascism yesterday, we will defeat again and this time we will permanently send it to the dump of history. As the United Revolutionary Movement of the Peoples, we commemorate the Red Army Commander -in -Chief, Revolutionary Leader Stalin in the 71st anniversary of his immortality with respect and longing.
     </p>
<p>
<strong>
       To the immortal leader of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples, Stalin!
      </strong>
</p>

       Yaşasin DEVRİM, Yaşasin SOSYALİZM!

   March
  </a>
  , the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of the old Indian State presented formal accusations against Sanjoy Deepak Rao in front of a special court for the NIA in Hyderabad. Sanjoy Deepak Rao, a progressive intellectual from Jammu and Kashmir, was already arrested several times for his activism. Last September he was arrested again, in Telangana, this time accused of being a leader of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), a party which leads the People’s War against the old Indian State.
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/09/28/india-alleged-important-maoist-cadre-sanjoy-rao-arrested/">
   We
  </a>
<a href="https://redherald.org/2023/09/28/india-alleged-important-maoist-cadre-sanjoy-rao-arrested/">
   have
  </a>
<a href="https://redherald.org/2023/09/28/india-alleged-important-maoist-cadre-sanjoy-rao-arrested/">
   reported
  </a>
  on this arrest.
 </p>
<p>
  The accusation includes infractions to the Indian Penal Code in several of its sections, but especially numerous sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) are included, specifically sections 17, 18, 18-B, 20, 38, 39 and 40. This infamous law has been characterized as “draconian” by
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/how-terrorism-law-india-used-to-silence-modis-critics">
   media around the world
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://thewire.in/rights/uapa-anti-terrorism-laws">
   especially by the progressive Indian media.
  </a>
  Among other alleged materials that would incriminate him according to repressive forces, Sanjoy Deepak Rao’s accessories, such as the laptop and alleged literature linked to Maoism, is said to be confiscated, as is usual in the raids of the UAPA. Rao was on his way to medical treatment when he was arrested, and the CPI (Maoist) has declared that Rao has been erroneously linked to the party.
 </p>
<p>
<br>
  Numerous activists and organizations for democratic rights have denounced on many occasions the abuse and repression committed by the old Indian State, using among other repressive mechanisms, the UAPA to imprison those who disagree with the policy of the Indian ruling classes and imperialism in India. Among those who denounce this use of UAPA, are the Campaign Against State Repression (
  <a href="https://redherald.org/tag/casr/">
   CASR
  </a>
  ) and the Forum Against Corporatization And Militarization (
  <a href="https://redherald.org/tag/facam/">
   FACAM
  </a>
  ), of which we have reproduced and translated many statements and press releases.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Between 2015 and 2020,
  <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/972-uapa-accused-jailed-long-periods-and-eventually-acquitted-study-finds-168494">
   more than 8,000 people have been prosecuted using the UAPA
  </a>
  , 97.2 percent of them being imprisoned for a long time, and finally acquitted. It is very common that these accusations are without proof, and this law acts as a threat and punishment against activists from the whole country. They are usually labeled as Maoists even though they are only activists for democratic rights, against repression or in defense of oppressed sectors of the people. This was
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/06/india-a-court-acquits-professor-saibaba/">
   the case of Professor Saibaba, recently acquitted and released
  </a>
  , after being accused without evidence, this being recognized by the Indian courts.
 </p>
<p>
  What many medias are hiding is that the UAPA is not an invention of the government led by Modi and the BJP, but that it is a repressive tool of the Indian ruling classes and imperialism,
  <a href="https://thewire.in/rights/uapa-anti-terrorism-laws">
   set up
  </a>
<a href="https://thewire.in/rights/uapa-anti-terrorism-laws">
   in 1967
  </a>
  , when there was an intense people’s struggle against the old Indian State. Since this year the successive old Indian State’s governments had the capacity, under UAPA’s section 3, to prohibit and pursue organizations and associations, without the need for evidence, judgments or other possible defenses by the repressed. Since this year, progressive media denounces that there has been a serious attack against democratic rights and freedoms, and in recent years what the Indian government has done is to use a tool that it already had.

  , the People’s Women’s Movement joined the march called by the heroic section XXII of the SNTE-CNTE. Women of the people, cooperative members, housewives, women workers and democratic teachers took the streets shouting “Proletarian feminism destroys the patriarchy!” During the march, support was also expressed to the heroic national resistance of Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  The march progressed from the mother’s monument to the central square of the city. Flyers calling women to join the movement and explaining the difference between proletarian feminism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feminism were distributed. The People’s Women’s Movement held speeches during the march, emphasizing that class is what separates us, not gender, and that the agenda is proletarian revolution, not the so-called “gender-ideology”.
 </p>
<p>
  As the march advanced towards the central square, it was seen that many businesses and banks had covered their windows with plywood, and the governmental palace, as well as the pavilion at the central square were also surrounded with fences and other obstacles, in an attempt to prevent the protesters from holding their rally in the end of the march. Shouting slogans, the protesters removed the fences and took over the pavilion to make their message to be heard.
 </p>
<p>
  After the rally, presentations were made in the forum “The Women of the Section XXII in the 21
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  Century”, discussing problems faced by education workers.

  March 18 - Solidarity Day for political prisoners - respecting communist and revolutionary prisoners
 </h2>
<p>
  March 18 is an international solidarity day for political prisoners. Founded in 1920 by Komintern, the Red-Aida declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the establishment of the Commune of Paris, "International Solidarity Day for Political Prisoners" and owned it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners is demonstrated worldwide.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
     The Indian recreational state has captured more than ten thousand communists, revolutionary and political activists such as Vice -Reserve Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilsom and Gautam Navlakha, to stop the Folk War.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been captured by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released even though he has suffered his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been captured by US imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionary and oppressed nations in the world have spent decades in prisons.
    </p>
<p>
     The fear and classroom of the dominant classes towards communist and revolutionary prisoners is so great that they prevent their own laws, contrary to their own laws, and the revolutionary from leaving prisons. In order to understand the fear and hate of imperialists and the prevailing system, the assassination of Chairman Gonzalo in 2021 is very important; The PKP leader, who lost his health after 29 years of insulation and whose death was caused by not taking the necessary health measures. Those responsible for the death of the chairman Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body.
    </p>
<p>
     Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the demands of class struggle with the threat of their lives, by trying the boundaries of prison. They refuse to capture and do not hesitate to oppose any kind of pressure, torture and insulation. We need to mobilize the prisoners' legitimate fighting and resistance to fight all kinds of aggression against prisoners, be the voice of the prisoners, we must support their struggle in imprisonment as part of a class struggle.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Supporting communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary battle!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Let us make our communist and revolutionary prisoners resistance and fight for ours. Let us be the voice of the prisoners!
     </strong>

  Hundreds of protesters walked on the streets to express their support for the Palestinian people's battle against Israel's brutal genocide in Gaza, which will soon last for half a year, with more than 31,000 Palestinians being murdered. Speeches were held, condemning the weapon sales of Danish imperialism and direct financial support for Israel's genocide, as well as the government's hypocrisy and lies.

  During the demonstration, Mobilized for March 18: International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. We have received a copy of a flyer that was distributed during the demonstration and reproduces it below:
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">

   Proletarians in all countries, unite!

<strong>
   International Solidarity Day with political prisoners
  </strong>
</h3>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  It has always been the case that as long as there has been exploitation and oppression, there have also been uprisings by the oppressed. The same is true today in the Heroic Resistance of the peoples in Palestine, the struggle of the poor peasants and indigenous peoples in Latin America, not to forget the luminous People's Wars in Peru, Turkey, India and the Philippines.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At the same time, it has been such that the exploitative classes in the world have concentrated their repression against the voice of the oppressed matches. The leaders are often exposed to the most brutal torture and oppression. With this, the ruling classes want to send the people a signal:
  <em>
   If you revolt we will do the same against you!
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Therefore, in the 1920s, the Comintern founded Red Help and on March 18 as the International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. We want to resume this tradition and spread the anti -imperialist solidarity with the struggles of the people around the world.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Come along and mark the International Solidarity Day with political prisoners in the People's House. This year we would like to pay special attention to the solidarity campaign with George Ibrahim Abdallah and the people's battles against imperialist mega projects in Mexico.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At the People's House we will keep the café open at 18:00 to 22:00 on Monday, March 18, where you can buy a cheap cup of tea or coffee and hear about the people's matches.

    The last event for the International Day of Women's Rights in the Tunisian capital was held exactly ten years ago, in 2014, only assembly events were organized in the following years.
    <b>
     Yesterday 8 March 2024, for the first time after ten years, the streets of Tunis were crossed by a great and combative manifestation of hundreds of women
    </b>
    : students, workers, women from feminist associations and Palestinian committees, together with some political and social activists.
   </div>
<div>
    The demonstration started from the working-class neighborhood next to Bab el Khadra, crossed it, then entered the central Place de la Repubblique and from there, marching along the Avenue de Paris, finally reached the main artery of the capital: the Avenue Bourghiba.
   </div>
<div>

<br>
</br></b>
</div>
<div>
<b>
     On March 8 this year in Tunisia he was marked by solidarity with Palestinian women and by the denunciation of the Zionist genocidal aggression against Gaza.
    </b>
</div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
    In the procession there were some historical posters of the popular front for the liberation of the Palestine dedicated to 8 March, and the feminist and LGBTQ organizations highlighted in their slogans

     Also on this occasion, the event, while marked next to the French Institute in Tunisia, stopped for a few minutes to contest the French politics in support of Israel, chanting slogans such as "Macron Assassino, free Abdallah" (George Ibrahim Abdallah, the Lebanese revolutionary militant detained in France for 40 years N.D.A.), many demonstrators with their Palestinian flags have affected the metal structure of the building.

Giovanni Crimi in Sassari died on February 4 from an explosion of a cylinder. I stop here but the case studies and the recording of these deaths is infinite: there are those who suddenly suddenly fall and falls from the roof, those who put their heads in a manhole, who improvise whitewashing and falls from the staircase, who starts washing the windows of the windows and falls on the streets, those who become a editor of curtains and shutters and falls inside and abroad. Whoever comes back the arteries in the garage with "smoothies" of various kinds, who starts to prune the trees of the garden and are overwhelmed, etc ... I could continue infinitely. In short, the house is full of dangers and putting yourself doing jobs that require caution is very, very dangerous. Nothing has changed since I painted this picture on solitude in 198.

      The productive heart of the

      is back in the hands of two

       Condemned

      For the most serious episodes that took place in the steel. In general silence, they reappear among the managers of the plant

      .
 And not always in the best way, according to the judges.

<p>
      De Felice - retired since 2021 - was sentenced for the
      <strong>
       water poisoning
      </strong>
      and substances intended for

      The judges of the

       Court of Assizes of Taranto
      </strong>
      they inflicted on him
      <strong>
       17 years in prison

     and the perpetual interdiction from public offices, pronounced it was

      "It was a source of dioxins"

     – is therefore back in the saddle despite, as we read in the
     <strong>
      Motivations
     </strong>
     of the condemnation, was one of the
     <strong>
      "Closer collaborators"

     of the shores and had a

      "Full involvement"

      "Industrial policies"
     </strong>
     of the then owners of the steel.

      Reasons why he was held responsible for the "spill of harmful substances" and of the
      <strong>
       "contamination"
      </strong>
      of the
      <strong>
       sea
      </strong>
      and

       land

       Under the Riva he transformed the Ilva into something similar to a "deposit of
       <strong>
        explosives
       </strong>
       managed by our defendants as Focchists "
      </a>
      . The Court did not give him even the generic attenuations because De Felice had
      <strong>
       patter
      </strong>
      in other procedures, dating back to 1999 and 2007, for a
      <strong>
       manslaughter

      e
      <strong>
       injury
      </strong>
      . Precedents that, the judges write, describe the
      <strong>
       "Capacity to commit crimes"
      </strong>
      .
     </p>
<p>
      There,

  Scream "Long live the anti -fascist Italy!" Not 
  It is a crime. Indeed, anti -fascism is a value protected by the Constitution, 
 As well as protesting for what the institutions are not doing 
 for the climate. At the Mantua literature festival, an activist 
 climatic had exposed a sign with the word “But don't hear the 
 heat?". Eni was among the sponsors. In both cases the dissent 
 politician was criminalized and people have been identified. The 
  information collected are merged into the Ministry's SDI database 
  of the interior.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the absence of valid reasons e 
 communicated, however, there is a risk that an arbitrary form of 
 filing. And that those who are exercising the free manifestation of the 
 just thought is treated as a dangerous subject, a 
 subversive. It does not escape the consequences of this new "practice" 
 may be far worse for those who are not an Italian citizen and yes 
 finds the request of 
 citizenship. A "mere suspicion" can in fact lead to a refusal. 
 “Elements that do not allow to exclude emerged from the investigation 
 possible dangers for the safety of the Republic and for this reason 
 impediment to the granting of citizenship ". With these few words, 
 three lines without any other explanation, only a simple suspicion, the 
 Ministry of the Interior, in the last three years, has rejected the questions 
 of citizenship of hundreds of citizens

 foreigners who had the whole 
  right to acquire it. And he did it without these people having 
 never committed a crime, they had never been investigated or attributed in a 
 criminal procedure, therefore, without having a stain on their own 
 judicial box.

  Punish dissent - this is the case, for 
 example, of a 31 -year -old man who was born in Morocco but has lived from 15 years to 
  Verona. Karim (imagination name) asked to remain anonymous for 
 protect its identity and appeal against the refusal of the 
 citizenship. In the Scaliger city it is well known and esteemed, 
 especially in the university world and associations where it operates from 
  time as a volunteer and operator. It is part of the self -managed laboratory 
  Pararatodos, one of the largest social spaces in Verona who carries out 
 different social activities, such as the Italian school, it 
 Social desk, courses and cultural events. But also an important 
 place of criticism and politics from below, through the organization of 
 Square events.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On a working and social level, 
 university professors, employees of the hospital of the 
 City, councilors and councilors of the Municipality have told that 
 Karim's approach is that of opening and collaboration, capable of 
 Approach different cultures, to build bridges. A teacher 
 of the University of Siena, who knows his work, underlined the 
 his ability to compare peaceful, altruism and civic sense, 
 calling him "a young man who is making Italy a country 
 improve". Has no precedents, nor criminal proceedings in progress and does not have 
 Never committed crimes. But the Ministry of the Interior nourishes a 
 suspicion, and Karim discovered it when one was notified to him 
 communication according to which there would be “elements that do not allow 
 exclude possible dangers for the safety of the Republic "which, 
 Obviously, they constitute an obstacle to the granting of the 
 citizenship.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In situations similar to his, to 
 basis of the decision there was a report by the police. For 
 This is man hypothesizes that he has been attached by the division 
 local, for the attendance and participation in the activities of the Center 
 social and for its commitment as an activist in the area in favor of 
 weaker. Yes, because these stories seem to be a step beyond the 
 criminalization of dissent through identification in banks 
  Police data whose newspaper has already given account.
 </p>
<p p="" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   “A person who lives one is preferred 
 life home and work, does not come out and does not participate ", he continues," instead of 
 Consider a model citizen who takes part in political life ". THE 
  his lawyers, who have appealed to the TAR, point out how 
 is already an active member of Italian civil society and as 
 daily gives body to the values of the Constitution. The court 
 administrative will have four years to decide.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   Above all suspicions - yet, 
 for the Ministry of the Interior which evaluated and signed the rejection of the 
  demand for citizenship, man is potentially considered 
 dangerous. According to the dicastery, “the impedimental elements come from 
 institutionally responsible bodies to operate for the safety of the 
 state, attributable to reliable sources of which it is not given doubt, and 
 Therefore, it is not possible to further explicit the aforementioned 
 obstacle elements ". And again, the provisions of the Interior Ministry believe that 
 “The verification of the existence of reasons inherent in the safety of the 
 Repubblica does not reduce to the assessment of criminally relevant facts 
 But it extends to the area of the prevention of crimes ".
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   In other words: to see each other 
 rejected the question of citizenship is enough a simple suspicion 
 intelligence, it is not necessary to have committed any crime. Enough 
 have been mentioned in a report during an event or be part of 
  of a contestation movement, even without complaints or formal 
 Identifications. Information not known by the interested party. "I have it 
 lived as an intimidation ”, comments Karim,“ but I continued to do 
 part of the movement ".
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   Despite the appeal, then, his own 
 legali have not had any detail on the accusations made, given that 
 This kind of acts is secreted. The lawyer cannot therefore receive 
 Another useful indication to find out the motivations of the refusal and so 
 defend it as the law provides. Not only. The defense of man, though 
 recognizing the wide discretion of the Ministry of the Interior in 
 matter, highlighted that discretion cannot justify 
 "The absence of a minimum of motivational content". The decision on 
 basis of the mere suspicion, underline the lawyers, cannot degenerate into 
  free will: not to explain rigor the reasons does not mean 
 allow the person to defend themselves. The Ministry of the Interior does not have 
 Reply to the commentary requests sent by email from tomorrow.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   Are not isolated cases - according to what 
 emerged from access to the documents presented by the Study Association 
 legal immigration, “the number of instances rejected on the base 
 of reasons relating to the security of the Republic was 233 in 2020, 
  169 in 2021 and 218 in 2022 ". For 2023 the data is not yet 
 Available, but it is possible to hypothesize that the trend is followed.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   The judicial authority would have the 
 task of supervising the discretionary power of public 
 Administration but in fact he does not enter the merits, limiting himself to 
 Check the consistency of the explanation given by Digos from a point of 
  logical view. Usually there are a few lines of motivation, a lot 
 generic, and lawyers not only cannot make a copy of the documents 
  of investigation - can only transcribe under the eyes of the authority - 
 But they don't even have the opportunity to oppose an exception beyond the 
 manifest illogicality. “There are evidently functional evaluations to a 
 prevention policy that, freeing himself from the commission of a fact 
  concrete, remains easily at the mercy of racial prejudices e 
 Political assessments, "say the lawyers. The fact remains that from these 
 suspects it is impossible to defend yourself, precisely because of the character 
 discretion of the citizenship measures that are 
 entrusted to the exclusive decision of the Ministry of the Interior.

 they are modern hunting

  Last May, Ukrainian pilots said that Russian planes 
  I am able to spot their planes and launch against them 
 missiles even before being identified in turn. In these 
 circumstances, Ukrainian pilots must be warned by voice by 
 Radar controllers on the ground of the threat and have no other choice if

  The F-16s also have some limitations that will reduce it 
 The impact on war. The former relate to their characteristics 
  techniques. As
  <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/what-it-takes-fly-f-16-challenges-ukraine">
   he remembered
  </a>
  a recent analysis of the Council on Foreign Relations Study Center: «I 
 Ukrainian commanders who will plan the operations with the F-16s 
 they will have to worry about the dangers represented by debris on the slopes 
  take -off. Since the F-16s have only one engine-unlike the 
 two of the MIG-29 and SU-27-are particularly vulnerable to damage 
 caused by final take -off or dirty takeover. The F-16s are not 
 designed to operate by damaged or improvised slopes ».

  These 
  considerations are particularly important, given that a part 
 considerable of the Ukrainian aviation operates precisely by improvised bases 
 To escape the Russian bombings. The aerial bases that will be 
 used by the F-16s will in all probability will easily 
 identifiable by Russian intelligence and will need to be 
 Thoroughly defenses.

  The other 
  Large limit of the F-16s is made up of their number. Initially 
 Ukraine will receive 6 hunting, training for twelve pilots and 
 About fifty maintenance technicians on the ground. Denmark, 
 Norway, Belgium and Netherlands promised the delivery of another 33 
 planes and it is estimated that the allies have committed themselves to providing 
  A total of 60 aircraft. It is not clear, however, when it will end 
 the training of the related pilots and the rest of the earth staff. 
 It will probably take years.

  I am 
  insufficient numbers to have a significant impact on the current 
 trend of aerial war. Before invasion, Ukrainian aviation 
 he had about a hundred combat planes and 
 At the moment it is probably able to make a number not too much 
  lower (part of the losses suffered was replaced by hunting 
 Soviet manufacture donated by Poland and other countries).

  Other 
  singing, Russia on paper can deploy over a thousand planes from 
 combat and, realistically, it uses different Ukraine 
 hundreds. This situation, combined with the effectiveness of the anti -aircraft defenses 
  Russian, makes it complicated for a few tens of planes to have an effect 
 radical on current fights.

<strong>
   So what are they for?
   <br/>
</strong>
  Although they will hardly be able to determine the trend of war by themselves, the aviation experts
  <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/10/f-16s-are-no-magic-bullet-for-ukraine-but-they-are.html">
   they indicated
  </a>
  Some important functions that the F-16s will be able to perform. One of 
 main is their ability to contribute to the interception of 
 missiles that Russia uses to hit Ukrainian cities, providing a 
  precious help to Ukrainian aerial defenses, increasingly short of 
 missiles.
 </p>
<p data-qr-debug="false" data-qr-elem-last-intersection-time="0" data-qr-elem-last-start="0" data-qr-elem-total-expose-time="1982" data-qr-index="12" data-qr-reading-time="9.64" data-qr-user-elem-full-visible="1">
  Thank you 
  To their modern sensors, the F-16s can "hook" (as they say in 
  jargon) Russian cruise missiles and hit them with their missiles 
 air-air (i.e. missiles launched by a plane to hit a goal in 
  flight). It is an efficient and above all economic method for 
 Defend Ukrainian aerial space.
 </p>
<p data-qr-debug="false" data-qr-elem-last-intersection-time="1710671207526" data-qr-elem-last-start="1710671206794" data-qr-elem-total-expose-time="664" data-qr-index="13" data-qr-reading-time="11.64" data-qr-user-elem-full-visible="1">
  THE 
  Earth-air missiles (i.e. those launched from the ground to hit a 
 goal in flight) are much more complicated and expensive, since for 
 hit their target need to reach great speeds and 
  travel wide distances. Air-air missiles, on the other hand, come 
 launched by planes able to approach their targets considerably e 
  Which, at the time of launch, are already traveling at high speed.
 </p>

  THE 
  NATO countries have large reserves of air-air missiles that can 
 be used by the F-16, while their missile stocks 
 earth-air are increasingly reduced.

<p>
  Here are some passages of his message:
 </p>
<p>
  “The richest and most powerful countries in the western world finance openly and praise the genocide committed by" Israel "in Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  The Gaza strip has turned into a concentration camp e 
 Those who have not actually been killed are starving.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the highest world court considers that almost every indicator 
 seem to satisfy the legal definition of genocide, the soldiers 
 of the Israeli army continue to publish "Video of Victory" 
 satyricals in which they celebrate with almost satanic rituals, and believe that not 
 There is a strength to the world who can consider them responsible.
 </p>
<p>
  Racism is obviously the cornerstone of any act of 
 genocide. The rhetoric of the high officials of the Israeli state has 
 led to the inhumanization of the Palestinians and their comparison with 
 The insects, just as the Nazis inhumanized the Jews.
 </p>
<p>
  Our Prime Minister [Modi] is a dear friend of Benjamin Netanyahu 
  And there is no doubt about his sympathy [for the work of the genocidal government 
  by Israel].
 </p>
<p>
  The Palestinians, who face the most powerful countries of 
 world, they suffered in an immeasurable way. But they won this 
 war. They acted with courage and dignity that inspired the rest 
 of the world."

A first statement from Ghassen Ben Khalifa via his Facebook page:
   </b>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<br/>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Personal/political/absurd divide:
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Regarding
the “moral” part of the ridiculous, fabricated case against me
(accusing me of being a moderator of a “islamist” page called
“Al-Burkan Al-Tunisi”), the court of first instance in Ben Arous
issued a decision against me yesterday: six months in prison (without
immediate implementation).
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   This
is pending the holding of the first session in the second, more
serious case (related to mild charges such as “participation in a
terrorist alliance,” “committing a brutal act against the
President of the Republic,” etc.) on April 5th.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   I
mean, Mr. Judge, he was not convinced by the words of the lawyers who
presented him with copies of the confessions of the gentleman who was
arrested (while I was detained and we were looking at the National
Unit to investigate terrorist crimes in Aouina) and in which he
confirmed that it was his page alone and that he was the one who
published everything on it and that he did not know me at all... In
addition to what is proven (from the archive of my Facebook account)
that on the alleged date and time (according to a technical report
from the Department of Technical Services of the General
Administration of National Security) I contacted the page from an IP
address linked to my phone number. At that time, I was connected from
my account and interacting and posting on My personal page has a
completely different ip address...
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   In
other words, Mr. Judge treated the security report of questionable
authenticity (and he does not explain at all how he arrived at his
conclusion - knowing that there are soon 30 pages whose owners are
required to be identified. He did not find, Glory be to God, that
page was clever and linked it to me) as a conclusive argument
stronger than a confession. The second defendant is stronger than the
results of the Al-Awaina Division’s research and stronger than the
apparent contradiction of my well-known intellectual and political
convictions with the content of that page...
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The
bottom line is that we will appeal this unjust ruling and prepare for
the April session. I assure all comrades and friends that morale is
high. I also reassure everyone who believes that with such ridiculous
charges and fabrications he can harm me, intimidate me, or make an
example of me...

Statement from the Tunisian Campaign of Boycott and Opposition to
Normalization with the Zionist Entity
   </b>

<br/>

   Freedom
for those who oppose normalization... Freedom for our people and
those who are aligned with them!
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Yesterday,
03/14/2024, the Court of First Instance in Ben Arous issued a
six-month prison sentence against Comrade Ghassan Ben Khalifa, one of
the founding members of the campaign and the editor-in-chief of the
Inhiyez website, a fighter within the Joint Action Coordination for
Palestine, and a member of the Solidarity Committee with the activist
George Ibrahim Abdullah. Background of the case that was raised
against him after he was suspended in September 2022 for five days.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The
ruling relates to the charge of “insulting others via social media”
that was brought against Ghassan in the “moral” aspect of the
case. This is a charge brought against him based on the allegations
of a report from one of the departments of the Ministry of Interior,
which claimed that the “Tunisian Volcano” page was linked to an
IP address linked to his phone number. This was proven false by the
defense team, based on the archive of his contacts on his personal
page (which prove that at the alleged time of the technical
monitoring process, he was connected to his personal page with a
different IP address), and the confessions of the page moderator who
was suspended before the release of Ghassan bin Khalifa in September
2022, and who He denied knowing the companion or having any
relationship with the aforementioned page, which he confirmed that he
managed alone.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   We,
in the Tunisian campaign to boycott and oppose normalization with the
Zionist entity, condemn this unjust ruling against our comrade and
declare our absolute support for him. As we support our comrade, we
stand in solidarity with ourselves and with those belonging to the
underground and those aligned with him.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   We
also call on all comrades, male and female, all struggling
individuals and progressive forces to rally around Ghassan’s case
and to put pressure and mobilize before the Court of First Instance
in Tunis on April 5, coinciding with the first session related to the
second part of the case in which he faces fabricated charges such as
“participation in a terrorist arrangement” and “committing "It
is a miserable matter for the President of the Republic."
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Arbitrary
rulings will only make us more united and steadfast. Freedom for
those who oppose normalization. Prison for typists.

<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Yesterday, Thursday, March 14, 2024, the Court of First Instance in
Ben Arous issued a six-month prison sentence in a sub-case against
Comrade Ghassan Ben Khalifa, journalist, editor-in-chief of the
Inhaaz website, activist for the Joint Action Coordination for
Palestine, member of the Tunisian campaign to boycott and oppose
normalization with the Zionist entity, and member of the committee.
Tunisian Commitee of Solidarity with the freedom fighter George
Ibrahim Abdullah.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   It is important for the Coordination of Joint Action for Palestine to
clarify to public opinion that this ruling was based on a security
report that included the name of the leftist activist Ghassan bin
Khalifa in a case related to the management of a page on the social
networking site Facebook with “Brotherhood” content. The main
accused in it is arrested and admitted that he is the one who owns
and manages the page. He is responsible for all her posts and that he
has no relationship or knowledge with the companion.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The Coordination of Joint Action for Palestine, while it considers
that this unjust ruling and everything that is being plotted against
its activist, is against the backdrop of his struggle activity linked
to supporting the option of resistance and against normalization, it
confirms that targeting its activists with fabricated charges will
not discourage it from moving forward with its struggle options, and
that giving the apparatuses free rein. The security lurking among the
activists will only increase their stability.
  </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The coordination also calls on all national, progressive and
revolutionary political organizations and groups and civil society
institutions aligned with the Palestinian right and all Tunisians to
attend in large numbers on April 5, 2024, before the Tunisian Court
of First Instance to support the leftist activist Ghassan Ben Khalifa
in the first session of the original case in which he faces charges
of “participation in an agreement.” Criminal” and “committing
a despicable act against the President of the Republic” and other
fabricated charges.

  Solidarity with Ghassen ben Khalifa, Tunisian journalist and militant
for the Palestinian cause!
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<br>
</br></p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Saied's Tunisian police state regime continues to persecute the
political and social militant for the Palestinian cause, the
journalist Ghassen ben Khalifa, through constructed accusations.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Already in the summer of 2022, Ghassen had been accused of managing a
Facebook page linked to Islamist radicalism and therefore accused of
terrorism, this accusation immediately appeared as a blatant
fabrication given that Ghassen is notoriously a militant of the
revolutionary left.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Incidentally, it was the first case of judicial persecution against a
revolutionary militant since the Ben Ali regime; not even the
post-revolt restoration governments, better known with the misleading
formula of "democratic transition" (2011-2021), had
prosecuted left-wing militants.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  After five days of detention and a large demonstration of solidarity
in Tunis in the middle of summer, Ghassen was finally released from
prison but the judicial proceedings had not yet been closed.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Court hearings followed in which the real manager of the offending
page declared each time that he himself was the manager of the pages
and the author of the publications and that he did not know Ghassen.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Meanwhile, the accusation of "offending others through social
media" and "participation in a terrorist plot" and
"offensive conduct towards the president" was also added.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Last March 14, the judge of first instance of the court of Ben Arous
(Greater Tunis area) sentenced Ghassen to 6 months of imprisonment,
not with immediate effect pending a further hearing which involves
the examination of the most serious charges for next April 5th.
 </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Our party expresses sincere solidarity with comrade Ghassen Ben
Khalifa, denounces Saied's reactionary police state regime supported
by imperialism, including Italian imperialism today represented by
the neo-fascist Meloni government.

<p>
   In the contemporary educational sphere, criticisms of public school teachers are recurring, questioning them for their adhesion to traditional methods that seem anchored in the past. This criticism, however, must be examined in the light of a set of factors that go beyond the mere teaching update.
  </p>
<p>
   The roots of traditional methods in classrooms are not only due to the lack of teacher training, but to a set of structural conditions that determine the educational environment. First, there is the overcrowding of students in the classroom, regulated by the nefarious
   <em>
    Decree 3020
   </em>
   (of December 10, 2002) that in its article 11 it deals with the number of students per teacher and indicates: «For the location of the teaching staff it will be reference that the average number of students per teacher in the territorial entity is as
   <strong>
    Minimum
   </strong>
   32 in the urban area and 22 in the rural area.
  </p>
<p>
   For the fulfillment of the educational process, the territorial entities will locate the teaching staff of the institutions or the educational centers, according to the following parameters: preschool and primary basic education: a teacher per group. Basic Secondary and Middle Education Academic Education: 1.36 teachers per group. Technical Secondary Education: 1.7 teachers per group ».
  </p>
<p>
   The fact that there are a large number of students gathered in the same space with a single teacher in charge (the minimum of classroom is 32 students, but that figure can amount to 38, 40, 45 ...) creates a series of challenges significant for individualized care and the implementation of innovative educational methodologies:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    The teacher will not be able to provide personalized attention to each student, since trying to meet the varied needs and learning rhythms that exist in the classroom is overwhelming and impossible to achieve effectively.
   </li>
<li>
    The overcrowding in classrooms limits opportunities for interaction and work in small groups, which are fundamental for the development of social skills, collaborative learning and the construction of significant relationships between students. Thus the time and space for activities that promote active participation and meaningful learning are reduced.
   </li>
<li>
    The overcrowding in the classroom is a barrier for the implementation of innovative methodologies, since these require a more focused approach to the student, with personalized and differentiated activities that adapt to the individual needs and interests of each student.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   And apart from the big problem that is overcrowding in classrooms, teachers face educating children and young people from the 21st century, who are immersed in a digital culture that has transformed the way they interact with the world and access information . This immersion in technology, although it offers opportunities for global learning and connection, also entails significant challenges, since excessive use of screens has resulted in fragmented attention and a decrease in the ability to concentrate students, which, which further complicates the teaching-learning process.
  </p>
<p>
   And this phenomenon is no accident, but is intrinsically linked to imperialist capitalism that has imposed accelerated production rhythms and superexploitation. The pressure to produce more in less time is reflected in the daily life of the students, who from an early age are exposed to a very stimulating and demanding environment, characterized by a constant search for efficiency and productivity.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, the parents of our students are proletarians subject to precarious working conditions, more strenuous working hours, forced to meet many overtime to stretch the pyrric salary that does not reach the loss of life; All this limits time and economic and mental resources available for accompaniment and educational reinforcement in the home. This lack of additional support outside the school environment adds an additional layer of complexity to the teaching work, since teachers must compensate for these deficiencies and provide an enriching educational environment in which students can prosper.
  </p>
<p>
   But the bourgeoisie and its means of misinformation does not take into account all these variants when it comes to ranting against teachers. They criticize a school that pedagogically remained with methods of 30 or 40 years ago, but they are not just as critics of obsolete school infrastructure, designed many decades ago and that has not adapted to current needs, such as climate crisis and demands of the students of the 21st century.
  </p>
<p>
   This outdated school infrastructure directly affects the learning environment and the well -being of students. The lack of well -equipped classrooms, outdoor spaces, adequate ventilation systems and modern technology limits the possibilities of offering quality education that meets the needs and expectations of current students.
  </p>
<p>
   And these deficiencies in school infrastructure are not simply accidental carelessness, but the result of an economic and political system that prioritizes the interests of the bourgeoisie above the needs of working classes and their children. The insufficient investment in public education and the growing privatization of the education system are a direct attack of the most loved capital that the proletariat has and that defined it as such: its offspring.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, to all these difficulties the Law of Inclusion in the educational field must be added, which has been a reason for debate and controversy in various contexts, because although it seeks to promote equal opportunities and the integration of students with special needs in the system Regular educational, in many cases it is nothing but a pretext to cut budget in education and avoid the creation of adequate specialized centers to serve these students. Instead of investing in resources and specialized personnel, they have chosen to integrate these students into regular schools without providing the necessary support in appointed personnel, infrastructure, materials and training, to guarantee their academic success and emotional well -being.
  </p>
<p>
   This lack of special quality educational centers and ideal personnel has left many teachers in a precarious situation, facing the task of attending to a large number of students with special needs in an environment little prepared for it. The pressure on teachers to adapt to this reality without adequate resources is unfair and counterproductive for the objective of an inclusive education.
  </p>
<p>
   Thus, criticism of traditional education cannot be disconnected from a broader analysis that considers the structural realities that condition the educational environment. Overcoming this model requires not only teacher training, but also a deep transformation of all school infrastructure.
  </p>
<p>
   To change the educational system in favor of the people, it is necessary to address the structural conditions that perpetuate inequality and injustice in the educational field:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>
    Repeal the
    <em>
     Decree 3020
    </em>
    and that the student limit per teacher is 15 in transition, 20 in primary and 25 in high school; This to facilitate more personalized attention and a more significant interaction between students and teachers.
   </li>
<li>
    The construction of new public schools and schools, the renewal of obsolete facilities - for them to adapt to the current climatic crisis - and the incorporation of modern technology in all classrooms.
   </li>
<li>
    Prioritize the creation of inclusive educational spaces and adapted to the needs of students with disabilities.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   The transformation of the educational system in favor of the people requires a broad mobilization and struggle. This implies strengthening and strengthening the union organizations of the Magisterium, promoting their restructuring so that its fighting platform reflects the main claims demanded by the entire educational community.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, it is imperative to link all students to this struggle, who are directly affected by the overcrowding in the classrooms and the difficulties that this creates for the teaching-learning process. The University Student Movement, close to becoming a proletariat of education and that have also experienced the difficulties of the educational system in their own flesh, must be combined combatively to this struggle.
  </p>
<p>
   Similarly, it is crucial that parents, belonging to the proletariat and the peasantry, join this fight for quality public education. They are direct witnesses of the precarious conditions in which schools and public schools are found, and understand the importance of guaranteeing a decent education for their children.
  </p>
<p>
   This union of proletarian and peasant forces, which includes teachers, students and parents, is essential to press and conquer the changes that are urgent in the education of the people.

 We denounce the invasion of the repressive forces in the FAI and the evacuation of the occupation of the physicist on Saturday, 16/3. In a "business" that had been seeing the AUTH for many years, MAT, OPEC and EKAM proceeded to 49 arrests, which turned into arrests and camped within the AUTH for over 5 hours. In an empty city due to the three -day period, the roads around the university were filled with all kinds of cop and security.
 <br>
<br>
 There were some non -existent damage to the infamous biological library. Unfair trouble for the police and its politicians to look for "reasons". The youth that has been on the streets all over Greece for 2 months understands who the attack aims. This is not the first one the first. They preceded them in the Rector, Law and Hunting of Students throughout the AUTH after the demonstration on 15/2. When students are struggling, we understand that Matatzis does not need any "excuse" to open our heads!
 <br>
<br/>
 The invasion was the order of the Ministry of Repression! The government, seeing it has gained ground in its confrontation with the students after the law was passed, the retreat of the General Assembly, the Occupations and the demonstrations, seeks to cut every effort to continue our struggle. Repression through the reminders gives way to police bats. The regularity of the educational process must be restored. It cannot only go ahead with a semester with e -learning. He does not want to risk the resurgence of our struggle. He is trying to give the finishing blow, as he thinks, in this two -month struggle, targeting the clubs that continue the occupations.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The Government arrogantly made an orgy of arrests aimed at terrorizing the struggling student youth. There are a few times that the movement has managed to turn such attacks on boomerangs. Massed the demonstrations and general assemblies. We will not let it go unanswered. Let's make decisions to complain of the invasion. Solidarity decisions to those arrested. Let's continue the fight for the overthrow of Pierrakakis law!

  More than five months have passed since the invasion of Zionist Israel's occupation troops into the witness Gaza. The dead are more than 30,000, most of them women and children, and the injured are over 72,000. The lives of the residents of the Gaza Strip is now threatened not only by the thousands of Zionist bombs but also by hunger and illness.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The Zionist state of Israel continues to threaten to invade Rafa, South Gaza, which have fled more than 1.2 million displaced Palestinians from the North. Such a move will mean an indescribable blood bath and at the same time it is a raw blackmail to the Palestinian people to make the "final solution" practice: ethnic cleansing and mass displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Israel escalates tension with both Lebanon and Syria. The same is the aggressive-war-war policy of the US-NATO-EU in the Red Sea and against Yemen, after the Hamas and Iranian executives of the Zionists. The whole area is at the risk of a broader ignition.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The ND government and all bourgeois parties (SYRIZA, PASOK, etc.) openly support the slaughter of the Palestinians by the US-Israel murderers. They turn the country into a NATO and Israeli base. They upgrade their involvement in the slaughter, sending frigate to the Red Sea, under the leadership of both the US and the EU. This policy brings us closer to the whirlpool of war, while in stark contrast to the feelings of solidarity with the people's solidarity. We for Palestine! That is why the ND government It intensifies the repression on the fighters who defend the Palestinian resistance.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Our people must demand to stop any involvement of the country in the slaughter of the Palestinian people.
  <br/>
<br/>
  To oppose the policy of equipment. This policy of equipment, drags him into the war plans of the imperialists and makes the country complicit in the Zionist slaughter. He also loads him with other unbearable burdens which, in combination with the policies of precision and austerity, immerses him in poverty and poverty. To claim with mass races in wage-pensions, and to defend his rights to health, education, social security that are brutally hit.
  <br/>
<br/>
<b>
   We continue our solidarity with the brave people of Palestine. We declare our sympathy in the struggle of the people of Palestine for a leather and independent homeland.
  </b>
  We call for the immediate help of Greek hospitals to care for injured Palestinian children. We contribute with all our strengths to form
  <b>
   mass anti -war, anti -imperialist
  </b>
  Front struggle that will oppose the policy of the ND government, the ruling class and the US/NATO/EU imperialist.

 The local, national and European news reports of warning reports on a critical offense to Megalonissos has recently been found.
 <br>
<br>
 Isn't it the poisonous rhizome of carcinogenic American bases in its territories? Their giggling? The targeting of the place up to nuclear retaliation of hostile (for the people?) Countries (controlled by bourgeoisie?) Due to its cowardice in a military portrait of the most bloodthirsty vampires on the planet? An institutional cause, which is deteriorating, by the dreamer of the dreamer (because this remains) with the Asia Minor and Cypriot scar on her body.
 <br>
<br/>
 That is, those of active participation with a rifle in the front line of the Titanic Front of imperialist competitions. As well as the care of a genocide - ethnic cleansing where the inhumane lake is struggling, to exterminate more Palestinians than the Zionist fire. Or is a new landing on Chania murderous aircraft crews whose violence overcomes their porn over?
 <br/>
<br/>
 Fortunately- according to anxious journalists- the previous nightmares do not apply. On the contrary, the integration (submission) of Greece's dependent order into the "right" gang of international slaughterhouses and their fanatical framework (frigates, infantry decision to send business plans) defends security (one candidate Hiroshima) (The same as "magical" enjoy Syrianians?). So where does the fear come about?
 <br/>
<br/>
 Are earthquakes and other natural disasters with state infrastructure, inappropriate to deal with them? Is it estimated that Erdogan will attack us despite the Divine Divine (master) Sam Sam? Will poverty and precision escalate by sinking to the bottom of the misery of the majority of the population while at the same time, profanity, enrichment of capitalists? Will the suicides of any sick people lack financial resources to buy medicines and appeal to the afternoon surgeries of the ravaged (the expensive barracks as a carnivore is fed by the prey of social welfare) hospitals?
 <br/>
<br/>
 Is there a prediction of increasing the workplace "accidents" due to the frenzied intensification of malicious staff in tourist galleys? Over -echoing the tertiary sector (the heavy industry of ... serving!) Is the most distorted growth promoted? Do the Cretan -based Cretan in the Hard Present Thinking To Power the Wave of Pentecost? Are the peasantry and with the trick of forest capital protection, are local property? Wind turbines, photovoltaic parks, hydrocarbon drilling, electricity pillars, energy roads and other monstrous interventions in the environment are it calculated that they will harm it incompetent? Are they redeemed with homemade crumbs and is the island under foreign predatory giants?
 <br/>
<br/>
 Nothing- unfortunately again- is not the case, as the demons (here are here paid) of the printing and electronic misinformation in chords with local factors and central leaders. So the panic is unjustified? Of course not. They have already landed in the last quarter on the south coast of 1500 "raiders" (Raki, Tuttein), causing the inseparable. Unlike the spacious hospitality of nearly six million visitors in the summer. Oimee, flows from North Africa are magnificent.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Ironic; Those who have not been drowned with walnuts are forced or dipped by the thousand Christian crosses on the day (Pylos) in the heartfelt for the culprits and racist for the victims of the area- of the region. From where they took off those bombers, they leveled their ancestrals.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Outraged? Because our country's increasingly bold involvement in Western war adventures will give birth to new desperate caravans. Since the Memorandum Politics of the Surprise of the Liturgy Homeland Mother with the calamity of Smyrna and persecution in the distant slaves of youth are common with those of current looting -trashing and exterminating expatriates.
 <br/>
<br/>
 A people unable to defend the refugees and immigrants, it is certainly unable to fight for their own right in bread, health, studies and peace. The progressive forces of the non -reformist left fight for the exact opposite.
 <br/>
<br/>
 After all, no one knows what is going on. Already in the past (and in the recent even the Memorandums) we have been in their dire position. Expressing class and internationalist solidarity with third parties tortured, we build terms for our own bearable today and redemptive tomorrow.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But there are genuine, devastating, hateful garbage that threaten us deadly. It is not the distant runners from the hell of fire or hunger, who in their impasses seek refuge in a destination of beasts. It is those criminals who live in the bases with their domestic applause, their locks.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The waste for the consolidation of society must actually be buried in the landfills of history.

  On Saturday night 9/3 in the square

   The transphobic and homophobic attack 
 in Thessaloniki is not an individual incident, but on the contrary 
 It captures the fascism of public life, and even the resonance 
  racist and fascist behaviors at younger ages.
  </div>
<div>
<br>
</br></div>
<div>
   Such 
  We have also noticed in particular in N. Heraklion, where 
 fascist groups are active trying to make the presence 
  them felt. Has an incident of an attack on a minor with a knife 
  In N. Heraklion Square last May, after an anti -fascist course 
  In N. Heraklion. Corresponding case with a knife attack occurred and 
 After another anti -fascist mobilization in Kallithea last year 
 February. Also, let's not forget the murderous attack on Shiraz Safetar 
 to Perissos in August 2023, which is probably 
 He was convened not to seem that he had racist motives.

   It's all natural results, 
 When on the lips of the official political scene and its policies 
 'Serious right' are heard statements that close the eye to fascism 
 and suggest young people to seek enemies who 'alter the 
 culture and values of the nation 'and responsible for the 
 poverty and poverty of the popular strata but taha 
 They are officially condemning fascism. When on social media 
 Provided patterns of masculinity, cruelty, misogyny, racism 
  And in general hate to anything different.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   The 
  Young people carry anger towards the system. As long as the popular struggle and 
  The movement does not give real answers to the younger generation towards 
 attack of the system, children and young people will become more prone 
 to such behaviors and ideologies because of their need to belong 
  somewhere. With the logic of 'we against them', they are attracted by the 
 Fascism that offers them exactly all this on the plate.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   THE 
  fascism in the form of the far -right is not accidental that it appears 
 More and more worldwide, and especially in our country. It's the 
 long hand of capital and bourgeois class, presented as 
 anti -systemic force in order to hit the struggling people and the 
 minorities and suppress them in the name of the system in which 
 assumed to oppose. Fascism is the extension of 
 capitalist system when it is forced.
  </div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
   Is 
  important to create strong race networks based on resistance 
 In the policy of the system that nourishes fascism but also 
 Solidarity and unity, opposed to fascism and 
 racist ideas. For this reason, youth and parents must 
 politicize, recognize and fight fascism, to 
 confront and respond to such behaviors and ideologies 
 In any space, educational or not.

   That's why the dominant classes want to destroy those who channel the anger and desire for change of the people and try to isolate those who cannot be annihilated by the people. The other dimension of the intolerance and aggressiveness of the dominant classes towards the revolutionary, communist and democratic-population movements is to ensure that the popular masses oppressed and do not dare to rebel. By massacring and suppressing the avant -garde of the people, the dominant classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will do the same with you".

  It has been more than five months since the beginning of the recent military campaign by the State of Israel, the most direct and bloody aggression ever seen. In this time, 31,600 people have been killed by Israeli bombs, missiles, grenades and bullets, but famine and illness are spreading widely after months of blockade in all the Strip of Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  In the north of Gaza, it is calculated that more than 300,000 people are on the
  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/13/israel-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine/">

  </a>
  , and the most affected are the children, dying of hunger and thirst. Now, for all these people,

</a>
  . It is clear that the ‘aid’ that imperialist countries provide is only to wash their hands in the midst of the massive protests that the peoples around the world are carrying out. But the Palestinian blood on their hands, their complicity with the genocide, they cannot simply wash away with such a bogus.

  The combat actions between Hezbollah and Israel continue after the large-scale rocket-launching by Hezbollah last week, as we previously
