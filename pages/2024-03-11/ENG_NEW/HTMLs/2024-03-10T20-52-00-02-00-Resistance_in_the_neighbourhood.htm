  The government's votes also needed Nazi Kassidiaris' "representative" to become the Pierrakakis law. And what the government did not do, from the beginning of its second term, to persuade or better blackmail the consciences of the world and especially the youth for the creation of private universities and their benefits. Student mass and prolonged mobilizations across the country not only clashed with government narratives but created a serious problem in the government's attempt to flatten everything in the field of higher education.
 </p>
 <p>
  On March 8, the 10 -year -old thousand students, traveling from every corner of Greece, flooded the center of Athens against the passage of the bill and that it would be reactive. The great repression encountered by the mass concentration was the result of the fear created by the government by recent student struggles. Such matches have not bent and will not bend in front of the bats and chemicals of the police, because they are fair races and must continue!
 </p>
 <p>
  On March 8, a significant snapshot was recorded on the student movement route that fights against the Pierrakakis bill for two months.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   On March 8, neither culminated nor ended the cycle of the race we have begun.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Against the gods and demons we have been able to break the silence they have imposed for months. The schools have been converted into spaces of questioning through the living processes of the student associations. Occupations and demonstrations across the country have crushed the terrorism of disciplinary, prosecutors, police violence and tele-confession.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the experience of the latest mobilization we can and should continue our fight until NIKI.
  <b>
   Until the Pierrakakis Law is reversed!
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  The DAP may be isolated within the schools to celebrate the bill by applauding the new attack that the government is launching, but we will not let it transfer the urban rotten to the student masses. The same goes for the teaching establishment and the administrations of the schools that stood by the government, putting a back to the specialization and implementation of policies that hit our rights.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the other hand, all the shades of reformism will return to schools with the "head high" without giving the struggles to continue. Anyway they did what he was going through to undermine them. With the coordinators' hegemonies, retreating in front of the tele-compartment, their participation in the House Committees (see representatives of the PSC and EASA last week) and finally with the attempt to close the race that has just begun. They played and play a solvent in trying to escalate the mobilizations against Pierrakakis law.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the new phase that is being formed, after the adoption of the bill that brings private universities, tuition and class barriers to all schools, our struggle must be aggravated until the law is overthrown. Students' masses must immediately overcome the defeat, the logic of bourgeois and constitutional illusions, the reformist logic of the "non-application of the law" and the electoral illusions, and to decisively enter a new round of general assemblies-transfers-ups.
