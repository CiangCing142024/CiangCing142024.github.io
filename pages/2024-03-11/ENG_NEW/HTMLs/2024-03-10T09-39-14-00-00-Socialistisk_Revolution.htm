   The Red Herald
  </a>
  informs that the former professor at Delhi University G n Saibaba, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment because of his alleged Maoist relations, was released from Nagpur Central Jail on Thursday morning, two days after he was acquitted by the Nagpur Court of Justice at Bombay High Court . We have previously reported on that case.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  In a speech to the media, Saibaba said it was a wonder and "random" that he came out of prison alive. He condemned the "inhuman and brutal" imprisonment and pointed out that his "health is very bad" now and that he has an immediate need for medical treatment.
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  He also thanked those who supported him during his ten -year imprisonment: “It is because of the wishes of people in India and all over the world and their struggle that we could live in spite of such a disorder and pain and the kind of atmosphere , I was placed in. "
