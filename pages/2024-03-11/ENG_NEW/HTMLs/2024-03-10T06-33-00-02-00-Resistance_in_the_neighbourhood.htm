 Advertising has a great influence on the masses. As a rule they present the 
 reality inverted through reactionary lenses. Advertising sells 
 First ideology to sell the product. Through the internet and the 
 social media media passes in modern ways the most reactive 
 views. All of these mechanisms overflow with fascism, anti -communism, 
 racism, underestimate the woman, promote violence and logic 'I do whatever I want 
 Since I can". They take out the most vulgar views of the bourgeois and indeed, 
 no glitches and pretexts, in the name of freedom and independence 
 of the press. Stypes and heinous crimes are fuel for operation 
 of the media that operate with the heart of the system, which no matter how much 
 Stylish, it will not even get a drip of humanity.
