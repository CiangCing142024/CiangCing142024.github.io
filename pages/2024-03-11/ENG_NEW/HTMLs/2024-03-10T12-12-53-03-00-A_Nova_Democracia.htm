During the act, the street vendors sang slogans like “

  </strong>
  ”, “
  <strong>
   Free the Uruguayan
  </strong>
  ” e “
  <strong>
   We want to work
  </strong>
  ”.

  After the act began, a large contingent of military police were sent to repress the street vendors by intimidating, vexatious magazines and filming of protesters, treating workers as criminals and curtailing their right to fight. Despite these actions by the state, the street vendors continued in a combative way occupying several streets of the city center, going from Presidente Vargas to Uruguaiana Street, closing the traffic of Avenida Passos, and then moved to the Nossa Senhora do Rosário church preventing the continuation of a work that is part of Eduardo Paes's eviction plan.
