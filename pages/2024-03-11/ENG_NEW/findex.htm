 </p>
<p>
  On Tuesday this week, Professor G.N. Saibaba In addition to five others accused of having ties to the Maoists, acquitted. This is what Red Herald writes. The case against Saibaba is a fabricated case, cooked together by the old Indian state. The Indian state has tried to criminalize Saibaba for his efforts for defending democratic rights in India, by branding him as Maoist. This is something the legal system of the ancient Indian state has admitted, since they were unable to provide evidence of any of what he was accused of. The other five acquitted were: Mahesh Tirki, Pandu Pora Narote, Hem Keshwdatta Mishra, Prashant Rahi, Vijay. Nan Tirki. Narote died in prison in August 2022.
 </p>
<p>
  This is not the first time that a lower court has been acquitted, thus ordering the release of G.N. Saibaba, the most talked about case was in 2022, when the court in Maharashtra decided to release him, but where this was later reversed by the Supreme Court (Supreme Court). The highest court of law in the Indian state justified this because G.N. Saibaba is a threat to the country's security and that he cannot therefore be released from prison. Therefore, there has been uncertainty about whether Saibaba was released this time.

 </p>
<p>
  Friday came the news that Saibaba has been released. To the media, Saibaba stated that there was a below and on the random that he got out of prison alive. He condemned the "inhuman and brutal" imprisonment and pointed out that his health is now "very poor" and that he is in urgent need for medical treatment.
 </p>
<p>
  He also wanted to thank all those who have supported him through his ten years in prison. "It is because of the desires of the people of India and all over the world and their struggle, that we have been able to live despite the suffering and pain of this type of atmosphere that I have been to".
 </p>
<p>
  When it comes to the health situation of Professor Saibaba, and the inhuman treatment the old Indian state has exposed him to, even the UN has asked critical questions, questions that have remained unanswered. Saibaba has had several health problems that have worsened as a result of the conditions he has served under.
 </p>
<p>
  Saibaba got polio and accompanying spine problems as a young man, and he then ended up in a wheelchair. The terrible conditions that the imprisonment inflicts on him, in addition to being denied the medical help he needs, causes his health situation to deteriorate.
 </p>
<p>
  Precisely for this reason, activists and organizations for democratic rights have condemned that this acquittal comes very late, and that no one can give him the freedom or health back. They have also condemned that many other Muslims, Dalite (castless) and adivasia (indigenous people) activists are still in prison because of UAPA (UNLAWFUL Activity Prevention Act, the Prevention of Ilurt Activity) and that they must be released.
 </p>
<p>
  They have also condemned that this is not something that only the BJP the government is doing, but that a series of different Indian governments has suppressed the Indian people in this way.

  Endless nightmare for Stellantis' workers in Mirafiori.
  <strong>
   Over 2,200 workers end up in layoffs until April
  </strong>
  . The reason? The Fiat 500E does not sell.
 </p>
<p>
  The communication came a little while ago, at the end of a meeting between the 
  management and trade union organizations. At the moment, in Mirafiori there was 
 the rotation layoffs on the lines of the Fiat 500 and of the 
 Maserati, a situation that should end on March 30th. 
 Instead, here's
  <strong>
   The new frozen shower
  </strong>
  for bodywork.
 </p>
<p>
  1,30 April will stop 1,240 workers of the Fiat 500 
 electric and one thousand of the Maserati. As mentioned, the motivation adduced 
 from the company is "
  <strong>
   adapt the production flows of the Fiat 500 BET cars and Maserati GranTurismo to the transitional market trend
  </strong>
  ".

   The Red Herald
  </a>
  informs that the former professor at Delhi University G n Saibaba, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment because of his alleged Maoist relations, was released from Nagpur Central Jail on Thursday morning, two days after he was acquitted by the Nagpur Court of Justice at Bombay High Court . We have previously reported on that case.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  In a speech to the media, Saibaba said it was a wonder and "random" that he came out of prison alive. He condemned the "inhuman and brutal" imprisonment and pointed out that his "health is very bad" now and that he has an immediate need for medical treatment.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  He also thanked those who supported him during his ten -year imprisonment: “It is because of the wishes of people in India and all over the world and their struggle that we could live in spite of such a disorder and pain and the kind of atmosphere , I was placed in. "

<p>
<strong>
   Our Danish comrades in the Socialist Revolution report, in an article, that the Danish imperialist state has admitted that they have known, and allowed, brutal abuse of power. Among other things, abuse against children carried out by the occupying power and the Yankee-hired government. This is a summary of the case translated into Norwegian. We strongly encourage reading the whole case.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  They write that Danish soldiers, submitted in Afghanistan as "security forces", in close cooperation with the occupying power in 2006 have witnessed, and actively ignored war crimes performed by both Danish soldiers and local police forces. The crimes described by several soldiers included arbitrary, brutal and humiliating executions on the street. In addition to the abuse and rape of both adults and children.
 </p>
<p>
  Until now, the Defense Command (FKO) has denied knowledge of, and lied that they deliberately overlooked and allowed such crimes, and justified their passivity by claiming that the actions had not been reported. This was later disproved, and the soldiers who tried to report, among other things. The abuses against children during the occupation were told not to interfere with it. The Danish imperialist state and bourgeois media are blaming the local police forces. And in a classical way, they try to hide the real role of the Danish armed imperialist forces as a bunch of hypocritical killers who have nothing against being as brutal as possible for both the interests of Yankee and Danish imperialism.

We are going to celebrate 114th International Working Women's Day at a time when on one hand  Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism has spread its tentacles in every sphere of life , and on the other hand ,  Imperialism has intensified its exploitative measures on oppressed people and nations. Now we are  under the yoke of two monstrous terrors .  Brahmanical patriarchy is an Indian peculiar chamber of  horrors. In a semi -colonial and semi -feudal society, where women  are forced to live in this chamber of  horrors then what is the value of constitution and fundamental rights. Women face multitudes of  economic and extra economic exploitation s which  goes unpunished and male domination barricade s it  from the general sight of society. Whether it is the war -torn regions of West Asia, Palestine or in Ukraine  or, whether it is in the garment factories of Dhaka, the valley of Manipur or the forest belts of central  India, women everywhere is facing the  burn of imperialist crises. In India, the condition of women is not   sublime  as propagated by the BJP fascist Narendra Modi.  Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism with the  support of Imperialism provides impetus strength to one of the most inhuman form of social h ierarchical  system that transforms women into an object of 'pleasure' and exploitation.    Finance capital for its valorization requires a unified market, cheap source of labor power and abundant  natural resources. Women oppression in the age of moribund Ca pitalism is interrelated with  finance  capital autocracy . Unable to see this attached strings, will be like punching in the dark. There is no doubt  that Capitalism in its free -trade; manufacturing period brought significant number of women from the  dark dun geons of household to factories. Due to this unprecedented expansion of social production,  working class women movements came on the scene that gave birth to subjectivity of women's rights  movements. Capitalism wherever it got upper  did away with some feu dal patriarchal values but  Capitalism gave birth to new form of patriarchal values that devalue the labour of women. Bourgeois   democracy that is based on glaring social and economic inequalities have failed to give complete  equality to women (the half of t he human race) and to men. Bourgeois republic only in words it  promises equality to women but it in reality sustains the oppressive patriarchy system that looks down  on women. Capitalist society turns every object into commodity and women are not an except ion and  actually she faces it many forms. Bourgeois deceitful phrases consoles women only in her imagination  but in reality those phrases denies the existence of Individuality to women which leads absence of  democratic rights. In Manuvadi system woman is c onsidered not as a free being. Right from birth to  death she must  be under the domination of male.  Right  to own productive forces  especially land  and  right over reproduction  sphere has been denied by the ruling classes in India.   Pro-Imperialist and Feudal Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeois policies of the BJP government have  broken the back of women dignity and her democratic rights.  Displacement due to corporate -driven  development model has taken away all necessities of life fr om the marginali zed classes. Women and  children particularly from the tribal communities  who come  under the PVTG are the worst sufferer of  the problem of displacement  in India . Casualization and contarctualization of the labor force in India  proves to be an efficient means for the extraction of profits by Imperialist and CBB led development  model of the Indian state. This led to the in -formalization of the workforce in the unorg anized sector  that is significantly composed by cheap  women workforce. Concentration and centralization of capital in  the era of Imperialism has crossed the red marks. This again has brought havoc on the normal life of the <br/><br/>oppressed people especially of wo men.  Lakhs of small scale industries were force to shut down during  the 10 years of Modi -kaal.  Consequence of it was the significant rise in the army of reserve labour.  It  was woman  who has to carry the burden of unemployment under her head as majority  of workforce in  small scale industries are composed of women sex. As the source of income became miniscule due to  apathetic economic condition , percentage  of women  trafficking and prostitution  has raised its ugly h ead  after the horrific lock down. All  these factors  are leading towards feminization of rural work force that  reinforces Brahmanical patriarchy with more intensity.   Sexual exploitation and economic exploitation of women goes hand in hand,  due to social ills they are  inseparable . At present most of the cheap agricultural labor is carried by women and at the same time  they face sexual exploitation by landlords and moneylenders.According  to the World Bank Labor Force  participation Report (2022), only 24 percent of women  in India  are gainfully employ ed. Retrenchments  of workforce from IT companies have become the norm in the time when capitalism is going through  general crisis. Most of the retrenched employees in IT sectors  are women employees. Even the wisdom   of the IT giants that is based on finance  capital  is not free from patriarchy. This rightly proves that  hegemony of capital  in social production  and the presence private ownership of production forces will  continue the patriarchal domination in society. As per as Global Gender Gap parity report 2 023, India  stands at 127th position out of 146 countries in gender parity index. There is no question of women  empowerment until the country remains in the shackles of Imperialism. Economic crises intensify the  patriarchal violence in society and it is est ablished by the fact that more than 4 lakh cases relating  domestic violence is hanging in the courts. Today, illiteracy is highest among the women in India. Out of  every 100 women, we can find more than 30 illiterate women. Due to commodification of educat ion  that serves the education corporate giants, schooling right from elementary to higher studies are  becoming out of reach for the downdrotten classes.The  drop out rate from schools and colleges is also   highest among the women. All these are the effects o f Pro -Imperialist and CBB policies of the BJP regime.   As the General election of 2024 is itching closer, the ruling classes political parties has not left any stone  unturned to cajole the masses for its electoral benefits that remains in the service of CB B and  Imperialism. At this time it is the RSS - BJP which has taken the central stage for advertising its facade  pro-women stand. RSS -BJP is extremely busy in propagating the so - called women empowerment  policies (Nari Shakti Vandana) of Narendra Modi's gov ernment. Nothing can be more hilarious than to  hear from the mouth of fascist about gender justice and women empowerment. Echoes of applause and  reverence are being showered by liberal feminists on Narendra Modi for his outstanding effort to pass  the women  reservation bill from the house that was stuck -up for more than 27 years  and for blocking  the bill for long 27 years BJP -RSS had played prominent role.  Lot of dust has already gathered over the  women's reservation bill as it has taken long 27 years to arr ive at the present point. Still taking such a  long protracted journey, it has finally turned into ineffective and contemptuous towards women gender.  To include delimitation and census clause in the bill itself proclaims that BJP has no real interest in the   bill. The act will come into effect "after an exercise of delimitation is undertaken for this purpose after  the relevant figures for the first census taken after commencement of the Constitution (128 amendment)  act have been published..."  The BJP governm ent has not conducted 2021 census on many pretexts. The  government is running without the knowledge of the facts about the socio -economic condition of  <br/><br/>people. All its programs are nothing but talk in air; hence it carries not a single grain of truth  but  fallacious propaganda.     It is been projected by the liberal feminists and RSS - BJP clans that this bill aspires to bring more  women in the upper echelons of power that will promulgate pro -women policies and a gender just  society. This is the ruling classes and fascist's treacherous design to cook consent for continuation of its  hegemonic and coercive dominance over the masses. In socially and economically backward country like  India, working class women, peasantry women and women from oppressed castes and co mmunities are  the most exploited being in society. Both economic and social exploitation remains an integral part of  women in India. Such exploitation of women is carried out under the guise of democracy and women  empowerment. Imperialist - finance capitali sm has kept our country in shackles that has denied all forms  of development.   The Indian ruling classes in alliance with Imperialism has negated the democratic revolution that  remains a necessary precondition to break the glass ceilings of patriarchy.  As  the entire Godi Media was  masquerading about women's reservation act in its prime time show, a Dalit woman was stripped in  public and then urinated by the upper caste just because she was unable to pay 1200 rupees of loan.  Neither President of India who h appens to be woman nor any other political parties has been  condemned the incident. But, India was celebrating pompously the women reservation act.   Women are visible in every struggle, whether in the Aganwadi, whether in Kashmir, Manipur against  terrorist  Hindutva forces violence supported by Indian state, whether tribal women who are fighting  against the corporatization and militarization in the central Indian forests  areas , against CAA -NRC, in farmers protests, in struggle against Hindutva fascism, in struggle  against Imperialism, women are inner  shell of all these democratic movements. All these movements are by women from various spheres of  life are part and parcel of women empowerment. These are all class -struggles and without class - struggles against feudali sm, Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeois and Imperialism there can be no  question of women empowerment. Real democratization of Indian society is only possible when the  base for semi -feudal and semi -colonial exploitation is rooted out forever.   To accomplish th is task "Every  cook must become politician. Only then can social revolution be victorious."   Dear sisters  and Comrades ,   Since last four de cades, Dandakryan women are fighting against loot and plunder of natural resources by  the corporate classes. They have resisted white terror fascist Salwa Judum Campaign, Operation Green -  Hunt, Operation Samadhan and now they are bravely putting up a fight against newly launched  Operation Kagaar (Final War). The Indian ruling classes with the support of imperialist  masters have  deployed thousands military forces in the J ungles, along with war tanks, military drones, c hoppers and  other war mechanisms. All these  are because the grass - root tribal politically consolidated women  is  striving for their rights over their forests. They  are fighting  against the fascist Indian Brahmanical State  for a just and equal society. They are in all productive works and are the blood - line of revolutionary  alternative people's political power organs. They are breaking the chains of patriarchy with new  democratic  cultural practices. Women 's movement  of Dandakaryana is  creating a new chapter in the <br/><br/>revolutio nary history o f human species . It is a source of inspiration for the downtrodden class and  oppressed masses. For that reason, the Indian ruling classes are desperate  to crush  the revolutionary  women's movement in Dan dakaryana with iron heels. It is imperative to protect and strengthen  the  Dandakaryana women's movement in order to nail the  coffin of Hindutva Fascism.   Rela Mad kam ,   Adivasi Women 's Organization (Bastar).</p></div>

   Collection of signatures for the Plebiscite Social Security at Tristán Narvaja 3 Mar 2024
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  This year, in addition to the union-demand struggle and traditional social struggles for human rights and for truth and judgment and punishment; for the social equality of women; for the defense of natural resources, land, water and the environment; for national sovereignty and against privatizations, and all the struggles that arise against the policy of exploitation and delivery of this coalition government of the right and the extreme right, the working class and the people have raised two political battles of great importance of great importance , the plebiscite of social security and national elections, and also solidarity with the heroic Palestinian people who have to sustain and strengthen.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   The Plebiscite of Social Security
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  After a year where the Social Security reform project promoted by the Government, with some general strikes and mobilizations, was confronted from the working and popular struggle, with this reform at the parliamentary level, even with the partial support of sectors From the Frente Amplio, the struggle began to carry out the plebiscite that is now already on the street and with an increasing popular support.
 </p>
<p>
  On the given fight, we must once again question the opportunistic majority that is a majority in the direction of the PIT-CNT for having managed this fight and the fights in the salary advice and in accountability, and for not unifying them and developing them thoroughly. We are also self -critical as part of the classism for not having had more organizational weight in the trade union and social movement to have achieved this. .
 </p>
<p>
  Despite this and relying on the great work developed for years by the ATSS workers union and its lucid and firm direction, the classism gave a successful battle within the Pit-CNT and after several instances the support was achieved to the plebiscite that seeks a constitutional reform that establishes 3 points: 1) Back to 60 years the retirement age, 2) equate the minimum retirement and pensions at the level of the national minimum wage and 3) eliminate the AFPS. This was finally approved and after months of hesitation of all kinds for 44 unions at the representative table of September 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  Then we worked on adjusting the text of the ballot, which also carried hard work so that the issues were well detailed and not to leave legal or political chocks. There the work had the support of a team of lawyers and economists who intransigently defend the rights of the people.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the summer, the traditional festivities and vacations at the Pit-CNT press conference of February, it was announced that 153,000 signatures had already been received. Firms that were achieved by lung militancy in the streets, in the fairs, squares and tablados of carnival, with very few financial resources given the limitations of contributions that were imposed on the internal Pit-CNT from opportunism and limitations To the use of premises and acts for the "freedom of action" imposed by the sectors of the right wing of the FA, which oppose the plebiscite, they generally support this type reform and also argue that this plebiscite could electorally harm the FA.
 </p>
<p>
  Given the large number of signatures that have been collected throughout the country, the demanded 270,000 are expected to exceed long when they reach April 27, the deadline for delivery to the electoral court.
 </p>
<p>
  To put him in the final envy, to make way for the plebiscite and punish this government hard at the service of "Los Meso Gold"!
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Towards October elections
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  We are already 8 months after the national elections of October and our Marxist-Leninist-Maoist party that struggles with the people for a democratic, agrarian and anti-imperialist revolution, uninterrupted progress towards socialism, considers that the political-electoral struggle, such as what It demonstrates international and national experience, it is important in the development of consciousness and the organization of the proletariat.
 </p>
<p>
  The active participation of the revolutionaries in this field allows a greater dissemination of the criticisms and complaints of the imperialist exploitation system - capitalist and the revolutionary program, helps the revolution to the extent that it is carried out with that sense and not falling into the electoral reformism As has happened with the social democrats and revisionist currents historically, which sow illusions in the possibility of changes in this exploiting system, true dictatorship of capital with democratic clothes.
 </p>
<p>
  That is why we have persisted since the fall of the fascist military dictatorship, to actively participate in this field of class struggle promoting the unity of the parties and organizations of the consequent anti -imperialist left, for 12 years in the MPP, within the FA, and Since 2006 outside it, in the Popular Assembly, then Popular Unit.
 </p>
<p>

  The popular unit, composed of 26m, pH, Modeju, advance and our PCR, celebrates its 18 years of struggle in April and is presented this year and for the fourth time in the electoral campaign, with a clearly anti -imperialist program and that proposes measures that They are going to socialism.
 </p>
<p>
  On this occasion with the particularity that an electoral alliance, Popular Unit of Workers, with the PT and the FTL, with which we have been coinciding in social struggles, in the impulse of the Plebiscite Social Security and Social Security and Solidarity with Palestine.

 </p>
<p>
  We are going to an act in the Plaza Libertad, on 15/3, time 19, where the representatives of all the organizations of the Popular Unity - FT and the aforementioned candidates will speak, with the main objective of giving a greater impulse to the Security plebiscite social and put a bow to the October elections, where you propose to recover a parliamentary representation at the service of the working class and the people.

<p>
<strong>

  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The 960 list of the “The People in Struggle”, which promotes and integrates our militants and independent colleagues, with whom we have been sharing the work in the class groups of the labor movement, in the popular feminist movement, in the combative currents of the student movement And social, calls that in October all those who have been fighting for deep changes in our homeland vote on the revolutionary left, to the consequently anti -imperialist left and that marches to socialism.
 </p>
<p>
  In particular we call on the 200,000 companions who did not vote at the FA in the first round in 2019 for their continuity and if they did it in the second round to try to stop the coalition of the right and ultra -right. We also call the youth that has been participating very actively in popular struggles but in which the idea that all parties are equal and the non-participation of the political-electoral struggle is sowing.
 </p>
<p>
  We ask for your support for our common struggle to win greater political and organizational weight in society to advance our revolutionary objectives.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Stop the genocide in Gaza-Solidarity Active with Palestine
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  From these proletarian pages we greet the great march of 29/2, promoted by dozens of social and political organizations nucleated in the coordination by Palestine and where 12,000 companions and colleagues participated in Montevideo and thousands in several departments of the interior. In these marches, the repudiation of our people was manifested to the genocide that the Zionist State of Israel has been making cruel and cowardly of the world that bombards daily a Palestinian population enclosed and cornered in Gaza, already killing more than 30,000 people mostly women and children, destroying their homes, hospitals, schools and mosques, while depriving them of all food and medical care.
 </p>
<p>
  We greet the heroic resistance of the Palestinian people who by all means persists in the midst of this war of Zionist aggression in the struggle for their self -determination, its national and social liberation.

<p>
  Last Friday, March 8, the street vendors of Uruguaiana Street were prevented from working by the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Guard as part of criminalization of the working street vendors,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/rj-eduardo-paes-e-claudio-castro-ameacam-camelos-da-uruguaiana-de-despejo/">
   As has been denounced by and
  </a>
  . In response, the workers held a combative demonstration for the defense of their right to work, shaking the city center.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration began at Candelária, around 9:30 am, with dozens of workers, Brazilians and foreigners, who with bands and posters closed 3 lanes of President Vargas, the main road of downtown Rio de Janeiro, and demanded the end of Attempted eviction by the reactionary government of Eduardo Paes and Claudio Castro. During the act, the street vendors sang slogans like “
  <strong>
   Releases the street vendor
  </strong>
  ”, “
  <strong>
   Free the Uruguayan
  </strong>
  ” e “
  <strong>
   We want to work
  </strong>
  ”.
 </p>
<p>
  After the act began, a large contingent of military police were sent to repress the street vendors by intimidating, vexatious magazines and filming of protesters, treating workers as criminals and curtailing their right to fight. Despite these actions by the state, the street vendors continued in a combative way occupying several streets of the city center, going from Presidente Vargas to Uruguaiana Street, closing the traffic of Avenida Passos, and then moved to the Nossa Senhora do Rosário church preventing the continuation of a work that is part of Eduardo Paes's eviction plan.
 </p>
<p>
  The correspondent of the and was present at the demonstration, making the coverage and reaping reports of the street vendors, who made several complaints about the neglect by the municipal and state government. One of the main complaints is that the government is making this eviction as a preparation for the G20, which will take place in November this year, receiving several representatives from imperialist countries, in this sense one of the street vendors said “will come G20, several diplomats in Rio de Janeiro , then they do that. ”
 </p>
<p>
  At the end of the demonstration, the street vendors reaffirmed their commitment to the struggle for the right to work, demonstrating that they will lead it to their rights.

  Plusted before the Armed Forces Generals, President Luiz Inacio gave a direction directed to all his ministries: to paralyze any and all initiative that deals with the Military-Deputy Coup of April 1, 1964, which this year will turn 60. Official acts, solemnities, mentions of speeches by government members, publication of materials or inauguration of Mark in memory of the crimes and violations of rights that the reactionary military committed in the 21 years of the regime - everything is suspended by express orders from Lula.
 </p>
<p>
  Last Thursday, March 7, President Luiz Inacio met with Silvio Almeida, human rights minister, a folder that had (until then) an extensive program on the subject. The information is from Correio Braziliense.
 </p>
<p>
  Nor should the creation of a memory and truth museum be effective. While still at the head of the Ministry of Justice, Flávio Dino announced the initiative during an event in Chile in repudiation at the 50th anniversary of the Pinochet coup.
 </p>
<p>
  Luiz Inacio's order is to offer an agreement with the generals who, in return, would no longer publish their “order of day” on March 31. Year after year, Armed Forces Commanders celebrate the date through the "Order," which is read in all the country's barracks.
 </p>
<p>
  The Federal Government had already disadvitered the recreation of the committee of politicians. And on February 27, Luiz Inácio, during an interview, said that one should not "break the story." The statement was defended by Hamilton Mourão.
 </p>
<p>
  It will be up to the true democrats, popular organizations and struggle movements of the Brazilian people the fundamental task of denouncing yesterday and today's coup of the military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  The newspaper
  <strong>
   The New Democracy
  </strong>
  will organize a political act on April 25 under the motto
  <strong>
   Neither forget nor appease: condemn the blow yesterday and today!
  </strong>
  . An excerpt from the call can be read below:
 </p>
<p>
  “It is urgent that progressives, genuine and revolutionary democrats undertake serious combat of coup, condemning the 60 years of the 1964 military coup and coup today. As part of combating the policy of appeasement (only one way of cowing), we demand that the Special Commission on the Dead and Missing Politicals by the shift government is reinstalled, as it is a demand from family members and of unique importance to bring to the national political debate the fascist horrors of the military regime. It is necessary to defend democratic freedoms, already so much and under permanent attacks, through urgent mobilization. ”

<p>
  This is not a mere negligence or silence! This is a conscious choice so that we will not see anything relevant and not to talk about an anthropomorphic that unfolds nowadays! In front of our eyes! It is a glaring choice of exclusion for anything that reminds the greatest genocide of the 21st century in Palestine!
 </p>
<p>
  All of the above relate to the organizers, namely the Board of Directors, the Artistic Directorate and the Managers of the Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival. And of course their government political bosses, the Ministry of Culture and Minister Mendoni. Why did they consciously choose not to include in any of the modules in the program of the 26th Festival, in a list of 250 documentaries, at least one (!) Talking to Palestinian Palestine, suffering, despair, resistance and sacrifices Palestinians. Even one (!) From the diverse, perennial solidarity movement in the West and East. At least one (!) Of the many, even very recently, by Palestinian or foreign filmmakers, talking about mass crime in Gaza. Even a (!) Even from those honest anti-Sionist Israeli filmmakers. Nothing! So absolute silence, equivalent to complicity!
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, this is not a random choice. It is directly related to the policy of the Mitsotakis government (but also the previous SYRIZA, so as not to forget) to become "ass and brace" with the occupation of Israel, to develop close relationships with military cooperation and to completely change this policy Older Greek Governments of the Transition against the Palestinian struggle. And at a time when the most reactionary and criminal wing of the Zionists in Israel is ruled. It is a clear political choice for the organizers of the festival, and in the city that has experienced and knows how to stigmatize the anthropomic from whatever status they are committed and on the pretext of trying to justify.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of this challenge no progressive man in the city can be indifferent. He must protest and even ask for the 26th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival to include in a special screening, at least one of the many documentaries on Palestine. Initiatives like that of the Filmmakers for Palestine - Greece, which calls on all Greek cinema bodies to take an open position against the Genocide of the Palestinian people from the colonial regime of Israel and calls for the reality of Gaza and the West of the West with the Western Palestinian filmmakers and director screenings are important and must be supported.
 </p>
<p>
  (PS The fact that the documentary festival has hosted films in previous years from and for Palestine does not acquit this year's choice. It makes silence more deafening and reminds that it is difficult to test the independence of its artistic creation and of course.

 The KKE (M-L) denounces the democratic people of Thessaloniki with the heinous attack that two people have received in one of the most central points in the city, with their only cause being a trans identity. The attack, which had characteristics and mob behavior characteristics, could have come to serious consequences if the victims did not find protection in a shop (with complaints, in fact, for bullying to those who tried to react). Police came after a holiday (and certainly not with the reflexes we see in any small or large popular mobilization of the city) and even at a point that is very close to a central police station.
 <br>
<br>
 The heinous, but not unprecedented, is not just the result of some young people's behavior with false opinions and gang features. It is the result of "education" with the rotten values of the exploitation system. It is the result of the action of the various fascists who act with the encouragement and coverage of the official state. It is the result of the policy that all of them (ND-PASOK-SYRIZA) exerts that the finger of the so-called "progressive", with their legislative interventions, at the same time that they form social conditions and patterns of herd, racism and enforcement on the weak and " different".
 <br>
<br>
 Homophobia, racism, violence against women, and gender -based murders, blind fan violence, school violence among students and other haunting behaviors and are increasingly appearing, are deeply systemic behaviors that They have their root and reproduce submission to the powerful so that the people do not raise. They have been sharpened in recent years by the conditions that the people and the youth live in, and by the rotten culture that is projected as a "outlet". They are the results of the overall fascist of public and political life. They are promoted by the sermons of the far -right and the church. They are "taught" on a daily basis by the intensity of state violence and the violence of imperialists against the peoples. They are not unrelated to the anti -communist attacks that have thickened, especially in the pre -election period with attacks on any red material that was red.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The answer lies only on the opposite: in the collective organization, in the struggle for our current rights, to bring the voices of darkness to the sidelines, and to open the way for a human -free society, where such vomiting behaviors will be eliminated by the same society and they will have no place in it.

  An attempt was made to disturb the march from the outside, but there was no documentation of the firms of the recession civilians as the loud and otherwise powerful demonstration buried them in cadres. When the demonstration arrived at Keskustori, speeches were heard from the march organizers and supporters. Police disturbed the speech for a moment with their sirens, but otherwise stayed on the sidelines.

  Sumud-A representative of the Finnish Palestinian Network spoke about a side of the genocide of Israel about women. The trade union movement was heard from a representative of the JHL local department, who highlighted the history of Women's Day. The demonstration and its arrangements included various parties from the left movement, which also made their speech. Palestini, the position of women in working life, and weakening of the government in rights and living conditions were repeated themes in the speeches. The Speech of the Maoists set these and other topical issues in the context of the imperialist world system and the patriarchy, revealed the services of bourgeois feminism to women's majority deprivation, setting it with proletarian feminism, when a solution to the revolution as a solution and the ideology and party required by it. The speech also received praise from those who had more or less disagree. In general, the demonstration march and the subsequent speeches were realized in a good spirit, which corresponds to the ever -heavier need for a revolutionary female movement.

      After the great mobility of November 25 in Rome,
      <b>
       This year, March 8 was a great day of struggle, action, a new strong and combative response of the movement of women who confirmed the will/need not to stop and continue to fight, to unite and rebel
      </b>
      to a condition of exploitation and oppression that invests every area of the living condition of the majority of women in this country.

     a strike not only union

      A weapon of struggle to be challenged, a strike that from the jobs touches all aspects of the life of the workers, women, young people

     modern fascism
    </span>
<span style="font-family: arial;">
     And from which also gives off a modern patriarchism that influences and affects the mass level up to severe emergence that today more and more men kill women, who must not afford to freely choose their lives, as if it were a normality.

  The screening of the documentary "Gaza Fights for Freedom" (Abby Martin, 2019) was crowned with great success organized by Thessaloniki organizations and collectives, with the participation of members of the Palestinian community on Saturday, March 9, at the city's Labor Center.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The screening of the documentary coincided with the launch of the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival, which provocatively ruled out the program of 250 (!) Views any material related to Palestine, as the Thessaloniki International Film Festival did in November.

  The obstacles that the organizations and colleges of Thessaloniki themselves have encountered when they first attempted to display the documentary "Gaza Fights for Freedom" a month earlier, on 2/2 at the Fargani Cinema, where they came to the Freedom. The unexpected change of cinema program, resulting in cancellation of the screening shortly before it began.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  So, in spite of the times, despite the coordinated "omerta" prevailing by the city's official bodies, as imposed by supporters of the Zionist Foniades, the US and the EU, the Abraham Benarogia Hall of the EKTH was filled with people on Saturday afternoon.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The Thessalonians attended the first Greek translation by the documentary of American journalist Abby Martin, which highlights the fair struggle of the heroic people of Palestine for a lighter and independent homeland. Through shocking footage and testimonies narrating the great path to return in March 2018, with displaced and refugees Palestinians demanding their return to their land and through a brief retrospective of Gaza history, the Israeli war crimes were reported. They take place with the US-EU backs and a 'vibrant' picture of the heroic resistance of the Palestinian people has been given.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The world was welcomed by a spokesman for organizations and colleges and the Palestinian militant Yehya Asker on behalf of the members of the Palestinian community. A call after the end of the film was addressed to the audience by the Filmmakers for Palestine - Greece Cinema Workers' Group of Fire and Breaking Silence attempted to impose on the art world.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Organizations and members of the Palestinian Community of Thessaloniki are calling for a new solidarity demonstration of the Palestinian people on Thursday, March 21st ("Day of Honor" for the Palestinians) at 7:00 pm in the Venizelos Statue.

   Poverty, fears of existence, malnutrition in children and seniors already belonged here before the current crises for forming phenomena of life of people. ”

  , it said. It is described how the rising prices for goods of everyday needs further tighten the situation of people and become a luxury and gas supply. In the district, 27 percent of people rely on so -called "transfer payments". The proportion of unemployed people is around 8 percent, more than every second child is affected by poverty. According to the district councils, these circumstances also affect the mood among people, the climate is noticeably rougher. Further write:
  <em>
   “The Falkenhagener Feld is not Charlottenburg and also not Prenzlauerberg. Here is the outskirts and here people are already going on the proverbial gums. […] Existing structures for self -help threaten to break. There are no bumps of social actors here who step in where the state is no longer sufficiently present. Nobody benefits from richer neighborhoods or new jobs in the capital. People need answers to the current crises and perspectives for a future without fear of hunger, cold apartments or the loss of their house. ”

  There are hardly any other apartments in the district, as well as in the whole city.

  <a href="https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2023/01/verarmung-in-grosssiedlung-falkenhagener-feld-berlin-spandau-steigende-kosten-miete-energiepreis.html">

  : "Many blame the politicians for the downward spiral." This clearly shows that the residents have no trust in this system, and contrary to the demands in the open letter, the situation of the people in the Falkenhagen field is neither more "social actors" as an extended arm of the system, nor by more "state presence" is improved.

  This is the real title (removing the well-known opportunist "pistachios"), and the line given by the article by Louisa Razu, a member of the KKE CC PG, published in the "Rizospast" of the weekend March 9-10. (
  <a href="https://www.902.gr/eidisi/politiki/358189/me-nea-ormi-paleyoyme-gia-dikio-toy-laoy-dynamonoyme-komma-pantoy">
   https://www.902.gr/eidisi/politiki/358189/me-nea-ormi-paleyoyme-gia-dikio-toy-laoy-dynamonoyme-komma-pantoy
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
<p>
  The mobilizations of the students, the farmers, the workers,… “they were manifested”,… “they were described”,… “found against the government”,… “Answer to practice” (no, of course, winning victories for youth, farmers, farmers, farmers. And the workers, but to show what the real "opposition in anti -populist politics", that is, the KKE). ... indefinite, he is clear:
  <b>
   The matches were closed, they were completed.
  </b>
  The "chuck" is missing to say and how they "won"!
  <b>
   Let's go now for the basic, for the main task:
  </b>
  The "party building" for Eurocles. A duty from which
  <b>
   Rather 'we got'
  </b>
  From the "unpredictable" pressures of reality! From there the criticism/self -criticism of the article in the KKE guiding bodies on how to manage the "extraordinary events" (the outbreak of the movement, that is, to the new spikes of the attack of the system), which
  <b>
   'Disturb the design'
  </b>
  (!!!) of the party. That is, the well -known reformist, electoral, absolutely within bourgeoisie, the design and path of the KKE. The bill for private universities has been voted on and can no longer be overturned (let's stay on ... papers!), The need for survival of farmers can ... wait and "cover" with the mockery and crumbs of the government, the anti -labor and the anti -labor expansion Accurately, probably ... they are alienated (?) Unless a strong KKE, in the House and in the Eurovision, suspend them.
 </p>
<p>
  Special is the reference to the strike of 28 February, where they "met," they say, labor claims with the demand not to erase the responsibility for the crime in Tempi.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the meeting of the very massive labor strike across the country, with the most massive youth mobilizations against the bill and the farmers' struggles, on a strike day (or in two, in three…) , and furthermore the creation of a single resistance front, which would put a serious problem in the government attack, was avoided by the devil in the incense, PAME and KNE. And they took care and they did accordingly! As for the "next day", for the continuation, for the prospect of a strike, where they were strongly and clearly expressed by large parts of the people, dispositions of confrontation with government policy.
 </p>
<p>
  Not coincidentally, it is very "degraded" in the article, the reference to student mobilizations, and, to be published on the weekend, it was apparently already prepared and printed the previous Friday 8/3. That is, the day, that is, the vote of the bill and the Great Pan -Hellenic Education rally.
  <b>
   So, while the big rally was evolving, the KKE had already prepared the announcement of the end of the student competitions !!!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  While apologetic to the government, it is the reference to agricultural mobilizations. Where the magazine and partial closure of the roads "did not displease anyone". And, of course, the government was not particularly forced, with such moves, "congratulating" the "coordinated way of demonstrating" the farmers in Athens. That is, it was not "disturbed" (like other times ???) the proper functioning and traffic on the roads. As if the poor workers, the unemployed, the youth and the people would be "unhappy" by this disorder and would become the act of social automation. And the anti -labor - strike laws remained again ... on paper! Probably no longer, they do not ... exist, and were voted on "for fun".
 </p>
<p>
  So, from now on for "party building". You see, the system has not yet been able to restore social democracy (SYRIZA, PASOK, New Left and others) and the far -right - they are priesthood as very important developments - and therefore there is room for the KKE !!! And of course, the "battle" in the polls (repeatedly their reference to the article to be "well", in the Eurocons of June 9, repeatedly. Not by accident, the article is published in "Rizospast", at the same time as the "call of the CC. of the KKE for the European elections', presented today, March 10, by Koutsoubas at an event at the SEF.
 </p>
<p>
  Until the 100th anniversary of Lenin's death (his bones will be baked!) Is employed to justify the most miserable confession: the so -called "party building" (a party presented as communist) is delayed, delayed by growth. Labor-Labor Games!
 </p>
<p>
  No. The road of the people, the working class, the youth, the farmers, cannot be that! The races were not closed, they should not be closed, no matter how much some would like it. The struggle
  <b>
   to overthrow
  </b>
  of the Pierrakakis law must continue, despite its adoption. History teaches that a true mass, politicized, persistent resistance and claim movement can achieve this, even if a law is passed (case of anti-lecture law 815, 1979-80). Farmers' struggle for her own
  <b>
   their survival
  </b>
  And for conquests, it must continue and intensify! The struggle of workers, the working class for
  <b>
   Increases in wages, salaries, pensions, for life with rights, to overthrow Hatzidakis and Georgiadis, the struggle against accuracy,
  </b>
  can and should be unfolded. In the direction of a front resistance and claim that will really put a problem in the attack on the government and the system. And of course the practical complaint of imperialist dependency on the US and EU, as a whole, the termination of the European imperialist building, the EU is not legalized - apoptosis of Eurocalp. Is done with political, mass, energetic
  <b>
   Abstinence from the European elections
  </b>
  that connects today, with the perspective of the struggles of the people, the workers and the youth.

  The government's votes also needed Nazi Kassidiaris' "representative" to become the Pierrakakis law. And what the government did not do, from the beginning of its second term, to persuade or better blackmail the consciences of the world and especially the youth for the creation of private universities and their benefits. Student mass and prolonged mobilizations across the country not only clashed with government narratives but created a serious problem in the government's attempt to flatten everything in the field of higher education.
 </p>
<p>
  On March 8, the 10 -year -old thousand students, traveling from every corner of Greece, flooded the center of Athens against the passage of the bill and that it would be reactive. The great repression encountered by the mass concentration was the result of the fear created by the government by recent student struggles. Such matches have not bent and will not bend in front of the bats and chemicals of the police, because they are fair races and must continue!
 </p>
<p>
  On March 8, a significant snapshot was recorded on the student movement route that fights against the Pierrakakis bill for two months.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   On March 8, neither culminated nor ended the cycle of the race we have begun.

  Against the gods and demons we have been able to break the silence they have imposed for months. The schools have been converted into spaces of questioning through the living processes of the student associations. Occupations and demonstrations across the country have crushed the terrorism of disciplinary, prosecutors, police violence and tele-confession.
 </p>
<p>
  With the experience of the latest mobilization we can and should continue our fight until NIKI.
  <b>
   Until the Pierrakakis Law is reversed!
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  The DAP may be isolated within the schools to celebrate the bill by applauding the new attack that the government is launching, but we will not let it transfer the urban rotten to the student masses. The same goes for the teaching establishment and the administrations of the schools that stood by the government, putting a back to the specialization and implementation of policies that hit our rights.
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, all the shades of reformism will return to schools with the "head high" without giving the struggles to continue. Anyway they did what he was going through to undermine them. With the coordinators' hegemonies, retreating in front of the tele-compartment, their participation in the House Committees (see representatives of the PSC and EASA last week) and finally with the attempt to close the race that has just begun. They played and play a solvent in trying to escalate the mobilizations against Pierrakakis law.
 </p>
<p>
  In the new phase that is being formed, after the adoption of the bill that brings private universities, tuition and class barriers to all schools, our struggle must be aggravated until the law is overthrown. Students' masses must immediately overcome the defeat, the logic of bourgeois and constitutional illusions, the reformist logic of the "non-application of the law" and the electoral illusions, and to decisively enter a new round of general assemblies-transfers-ups.

      "... both because it is the Meloni government, the masters of this country are those who build weapons above all, who are the accomplices and co -responsible for the genocide in Palestine. These monsters, as our livers of workers use their profits, Their reactionary, racist, repressive plans to prevent the freedom of us women, are the same who want to crush the Palestinian people and women. The struggle of Palestinian women, therefore, is our struggle, helps us against this putrefied system; and The struggle of us working women is also the struggle of Palestinian women, because it weakens our imperialist monsters

  Netherlands | 10.03.2024 | On the occasion of 8 March International Working Women's Day, the Alevi Association organized an event Beverwijk/HeemsKerk (Netherlands). In addition to the seminar titled History of March 8 and the Women's Struggle today, Behakder Music Group took part in the event with the folk songs.
 </p>
<p>
  The March 8 event began with a minute of silence for women who lost their lives in the fight against Clara Zetkin to Alexandra Kollantai, Rosa Luxemburg, and Barbara Anna Kists from Meral Yakar.
 </p>
<p>
  Zeynep Çalışkan, the new female representative who participated in the event as a speaker, made a presentation about the demands of women's struggle and what it means today, referring to the struggles, strikes and resistances of workers in the process until the declaration of March 8 as International Working Women's Day. In his speech, Çalışkan emphasized the rising racism and war scenarios of imperialists in Europe and drew attention with various data and examples that this situation increased pressure, violence and exploitation against women. Speech ended with a call for organization.
 </p>
<p>
  The music group, which carries out its works within Behakder, drew a good music feast for the participants.

  The KKE (M-L) denounces the democratic people of Thessaloniki with the heinous attack that two people have received in one of the most central points in the city, with their only cause being a trans identity. The attack, which had characteristics and mob behavior characteristics, could have come to serious consequences if the victims did not find protection in a shop (with complaints, even for blackmails to those who tried to react). Police came after a holiday (and certainly not with the reflexes we see in any small or large popular mobilization of the city) and even at a point that is very close to a central police station.
 </p>
<p>
  The heinous, but not unprecedented, is not just the result of some young people's behavior with false opinions and gang features. It is the result of "education" with the rotten values of the exploitation system. It is the result of the action of the various fascists who act with the encouragement and coverage of the official state. It is the result of the policy that all of them (ND-PASOK-SYRIZA) exerts that the finger of the so-called "progressive", with their legislative interventions, at the same time that they form social conditions and patterns of herd, racism and enforcement on the weak and " different".
 </p>
<p>
  Homophobia, racism, violence against women, and gender -based murders, blind fan violence, school violence among students and other haunting behaviors and are increasingly appearing, are deeply systemic behaviors that They have their root and reproduce submission to the powerful so that the people do not raise. They have been sharpened in recent years by the conditions that the people and the youth live in, and by the rotten culture that is projected as a "outlet". They are the results of the overall fascist of public and political life. They are promoted by the sermons of the far -right and the church. They are "taught" on a daily basis by the intensity of state violence and the violence of imperialists against the peoples. They are not unrelated to the anti -communist attacks that have thickened, especially in the pre -election period with attacks on any red material that was red.
 </p>
<p>
  The answer lies only on the opposite: in the collective organization, in the struggle for our current rights, to bring the voices of darkness to the sidelines, and to open the way for a human -free society, where such vomiting behaviors will be eliminated by the same society and they will have no place in it.

   <strong>
    No’Oxonec- border cotton
   </strong>
   : For the fourth consecutive year they reaped more than 700 kilos of agroecological cotton, without patterns and in a community way that will then return in threads and fabrics for the clothing of newborn clothing. An example that in these territories is struggling to work in very difficult conditions and a sample more than many of the social movements are the true articulators of public policies and social assistance.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Reaping future
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Dawn in the deep Chaco. There, in the then ingenuity Las Palmas del Chaco Austral, where in 1885 the electric light was turned on for the first time in our country, today it is distinguished by something innovative: agroecological cotton occurs, under community organization and that returns in supplies For the elaboration of newborn clothing.
  </p>
<p>
   More than 60 women and men are arranged in the ranks of the codonal. The most experienced explain to the rest which cocoon is better to reap, and which others will remain for the next pass. Even the heat does not hit so much, so the work begins between laughs, talks and the occasional mate that circulates between hands free. Gone is the memory of trips in trucks, bent towards the harvest, under the command of the foreman and in days of intense work in exchange for a little flour and fat to eat. “Here is something else, we come, we are among us, we share, we laugh; We do it with other desire, it is not as before, ”says a man while loading the cotton harvested inside the fabric bags. Little by little, they are filled. Then the white flakes accumulate on a canvas to dry under the sun. There is enthusiasm: it seems that this year the quality and quantity is exceeded.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    The “No’Oxonec- border cotton” project
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The project is called “No’Oxonec-border cotton” -which means "fabric" in Qom-, and the CCC of Las Palmas is a link more than a chain of social and solidarity economy. It began in 2020, based on the “Productive Alliances” program of the socio -economic inclusion project in rural areas (stepping) funded by the World Bank. The prominence is the Creole families and belonging to the Qom people of Pampa del Indio, Qochiñilae (Roca Presidency), the Leonese and Las Palmas. And, also, numerous organizations and spaces participate such as the Dr. Ramón Carrillo Foundation, the Association of Small Producers of the Chaco, the CCC of Las Palmas, the National Campesina Federation of the Maipú Rural Place Different rural consortiums, cooperatives and textile workshops, such as the "interwoven collective" and "Kalu Gryb", both of resistance, among others. In addition, it has the Technical Assistance of the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), the National Institute of Industrial Technology (INTI) and the help of the municipalities of Presidency Roca, Pampa del Indio and Las Palmas, the Undersecretariat of Agriculture, the Undersecretariat of cotton and the Institute of Culture of the Province of Chaco.
  </p>
<p>
   The objective is to rebuild the productive system in communities affected by fumigations with agrotoxic through the production of agroecological cotton. It is done taking advantage of the goodness of the soil, with natural supplies and fertilizers and it is aspired to reach an added value that is 100% Chaqueño. The reference of producing in a healthy way is not a minor fact for the "Chacra Group", as members of the Social Movement, responsible for planting and care tasks. The reason that makes the difference is the experience with the contamination of the Rroceras San Carlos S.R.L. and Court Long S.A., who for years became synonymous with transgenics and agrotoxic, until a precautionary measure managed to impose a limit on air fumigations. This is reported by a young man from the group:
  </p>
<p>
   “Here do not use chemicals that will damage the earth. Before we had the problem of the rice that long chemicals and there were seasons that fish, plants and grabbed diseases that you went to the hospital were dying and did not know what you had. After they stopped doing it, the plants are seen to grow more strongly, it is not as before. ”
  </p>
<p>
   The seed is the germ of this project. They are not transgenic, that means that they have not been genetically modified and that they can be reproduced naturally, work that is consolidated after each harvest. Once the cotton is taken to disassemble, the fiber is separated and the seeds return to the farm for storage and the same is solidarily distributed in neighboring communities.
  </p>
<p>
   To start the sowing tasks, who integrate the CCC Chacra group, they also received advice and training in agroecology, which provided INTA technicians and the Dr. Ramón Carrillo Foundation. This education is very important because it allows to combine the knowledge of those who have experience in cotton production, tradition by antonomasia in the Argentine Chaco, and the knowledge of agroecology, which promotes more sustainable and resilient systems. From here, tasks arise for the elaboration of natural fertilizers and pesticides where other agrodive productions such as orchards, bean, pumpkin, watermelon and agroecological corn are also developed.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    The work they do not recognize and the social assistance that does not reach
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Organization and work in the cotton project is an easy task for social movement. Reyna, a reference of the CCC of Las Palmas, clarifies: “It is not that you are a government project and they tell you` Well, this is so, here I send you a budget. No, they give you a part and then we have to make days, raffles, food sales, to be able to buy everything, for example, for textile companions, all inputs; For Chakra, the tools. "
  </p>
<p>
   The property where the productive experience is currently carried out was achieved by permission of the municipality. They are a few hectares belonging to the fiscal ejido and are part of the historical claim of the community of Las Palmas for the Sunday regularization of the lands of the former ingenuity. The idea is to sow little hectares, because agroecology also hopes to recover human work, without great machinery, is even necessary for the control of organisms that attack the crop, such as the excuser.
  </p>
<p>
   The tasks in the farm are fulfilled in working days that the members of the Movement decide, who are awardee of the Program Program - currently $ 78,000 per month - and the Provincial Program Progressive Income - $ 20,000 per month - that is combined with help Municipal for the lean increases that arrive, amounts that are totally outdated in relation to the current inflationary context and the tasks they carry out.
  </p>
<p>
   It happens that organizing, planning and managing project activities means assuming tasks that widely exceed the state programs and assistance they receive. Reyna comments: “Then we had to do weed and close, because the neighbors have animals. The companions took out the calculation and needed so much posts and wire. We don't have to buy. And well, going to look for those posts is to put the workforce of companions in places where they allow us to enter to look for palm trees. You have to walk, far, each with their water and something to eat, all day. Some carry an ax, other chainsaw, which carries its oil and fuel, that if the leaf is broken it has a tremendous cost. They are very hard days and days; 100, 200, 300 posts. Then bring them, do the wells and get the wire and the cost of wire! It is one thing to tell it and another thing is to see it. ”
  </p>
<p>
   Thats not all. The weather also played a bad pass. In October last year, a strong storm with hail drop ruined 40% of sown cotton, 70% corn, pumpkin and watermelon and 100% leafy vegetables, together with the destruction of the infrastructure. The Chakra group had to sow and cope with the adversity of starting again.

<strong>
    Weave hope with agroecological cotton
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   After the cotton harvest, the disassembly is done at the INTA headquarters in the town of P. R. Sáenz Peña, where the seeds return to the producers for the next planting and the fiber enters a circuit of textile cooperativism that includes spinning, fabric and preparation of garments with 100% agroecological fabrics. For the CCC, the cycle closes when threads and fabrics enter the textile group, which is also trained in making designs for clothing with cotton that has a unique fiber, which has not touched tinctures or poisons and that has occurred Just a few kilometers from there.

<strong>
    The "Booty of War", according to Javier Milei
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   On March 1, the President of the Nation accused the left -wing organizations of using social programs such as "Botín de Guerra" that steal silver and attentive to those who are beneficiaries of that right. This defamation of the National Government for stigmatizing social organizations and movements is not new and intends to create a scenario of delegitimization and violence to remove assistance and further impoverish popular sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   The reality is another: we have seen that it is the social movements that guarantee popular pots in times of food emergency, vaccination in times of pandemic and organization when social assistance arrives; They maintain and organize territorial work in every corner of Argentina. In short, the community experience of agroecological cotton and many others that can be shown, places them as the true guarantors that public policies arrive and concretize in the territories, even in the difficult working conditions and availability of resources. This is what makes them target stigmatizations and persecutions. However, in the face of these unfounded sayings, by force of struggle and commitment, social movements in Chaco redouble the commitment and harvest future, promoting proposals for the development of agriculture with farmers, of the national industry and regional economies.
