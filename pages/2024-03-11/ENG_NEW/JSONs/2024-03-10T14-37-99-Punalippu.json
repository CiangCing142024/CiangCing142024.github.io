The trade union movement was heard from a representative of the JHL local department, who highlighted the history of Women's Day. The demonstration and its arrangements included various parties from the left movement, which also made their speech. Palestini, the position of women in working life, and weakening of the government in rights and living conditions were repeated themes in the speeches. The Speech of the Maoists set these and other topical issues in the context of the imperialist world system and the patriarchy, revealed the services of bourgeois feminism to women's majority deprivation, setting it with proletarian feminism, when a solution to the revolution as a solution and the ideology and party required by it. The speech also received praise from those who had more or less disagree. In general, the demonstration march and the subsequent speeches were realized in a good spirit, which corresponds to the ever -heavier need for a revolutionary female movement.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_4985\" style=\"width: 730px\">\n  <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n   &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-4985\">\n   At the Central Market (reader picture).\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://punalippu.noblogs.org/post/2024/03/10/tre-kansainvalinen-naistenpaiva/", "title": "TRE: International Women's Day", "author": ["lipunkantaja"], "categories": ["Yleinen"]}
