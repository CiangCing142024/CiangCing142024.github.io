Saibaba In addition to five others accused of having ties to the Maoists, acquitted. This is what Red Herald writes. The case against Saibaba is a fabricated case, cooked together by the old Indian state. The Indian state has tried to criminalize Saibaba for his efforts for defending democratic rights in India, by branding him as Maoist. This is something the legal system of the ancient Indian state has admitted, since they were unable to provide evidence of any of what he was accused of. The other five acquitted were: Mahesh Tirki, Pandu Pora Narote, Hem Keshwdatta Mishra, Prashant Rahi, Vijay. Nan Tirki. Narote died in prison in August 2022.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is not the first time that a lower court has been acquitted, thus ordering the release of G.N. Saibaba, the most talked about case was in 2022, when the court in Maharashtra decided to release him, but where this was later reversed by the Supreme Court (Supreme Court). The highest court of law in the Indian state justified this because G.N. Saibaba is a threat to the country's security and that he cannot therefore be released from prison. Therefore, there has been uncertainty about whether Saibaba was released this time.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33129\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"900\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" src=\"https://tjen-folket.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/G-N-Saibaba-with-his-wife-Vasantha-Kumari-after-his-release-from-jail-in-Nagpur-Thursday.-PTI-1483934271.jpg\" srcset=\"https://tjen-folket.no/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/G-N-Saibaba-with-his-wife-Vasantha-Kumari-after-his-release-from-jail-in-Nagpur-Thursday.-PTI-1483934271.jpg\" width=\"1600\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Image: Saibaba with his wife after the release. Source: Indian Express\n </p>\n <p>\n  Friday came the news that Saibaba has been released. To the media, Saibaba stated that there was a below and on the random that he got out of prison alive. He condemned the \"inhuman and brutal\" imprisonment and pointed out that his health is now \"very poor\" and that he is in urgent need for medical treatment.\n </p>\n <p>\n  He also wanted to thank all those who have supported him through his ten years in prison. \"It is because of the desires of the people of India and all over the world and their struggle, that we have been able to live despite the suffering and pain of this type of atmosphere that I have been to\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  When it comes to the health situation of Professor Saibaba, and the inhuman treatment the old Indian state has exposed him to, even the UN has asked critical questions, questions that have remained unanswered. Saibaba has had several health problems that have worsened as a result of the conditions he has served under.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Saibaba got polio and accompanying spine problems as a young man, and he then ended up in a wheelchair. The terrible conditions that the imprisonment inflicts on him, in addition to being denied the medical help he needs, causes his health situation to deteriorate.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Precisely for this reason, activists and organizations for democratic rights have condemned that this acquittal comes very late, and that no one can give him the freedom or health back. They have also condemned that many other Muslims, Dalite (castless) and adivasia (indigenous people) activists are still in prison because of UAPA (UNLAWFUL Activity Prevention Act, the Prevention of Ilurt Activity) and that they must be released.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They have also condemned that this is not something that only the BJP the government is doing, but that a series of different Indian governments has suppressed the Indian people in this way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   The sea:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-tjen-folket-media wp-block-embed-tjen-folket-media\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wz3YunTquR\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <a href=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2022/10/19/indisk-hoyesterett-opphever-frikjennelse-av-saibaba/\">\n     Indian Supreme Court abolishes the acquittal of Saibaba\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"wz3YunTquR\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"257\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2022/10/19/indisk-hoyesterett-opphever-frikjennelse-av-saibaba/embed/#?secret=SiituMeJiw#?secret=wz3YunTquR\" title=\"\u00abIndisk h\u00f8yesterett opphever frikjennelse av Saibaba\u00bb \u2014 Tjen Folket Media\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-tjen-folket-media wp-block-embed-tjen-folket-media\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"dWCPkQjbUs\" style=\"display: none;\">\n    <a href=\"https://tjen-folket.no/2022/05/25/india-g-n-saibaba-innleder-ny-sultestreik/\">\n     India: G.
