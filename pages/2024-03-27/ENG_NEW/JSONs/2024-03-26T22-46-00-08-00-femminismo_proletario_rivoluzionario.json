Perhaps the fact that not receiving news from the outside and that I have no contact with my world makes me feel in a kind of suspended bubble. It is a bit like time for me had stopped. There is no first one is a after but only the \"inside\" and the \"outside\": there are two absolutely incompatible worlds and my mind cannot place them on the same temporal axis.

Sometimes I wonder if this well has a bottom and if there is really an exit somewhere. I guess they are a small gecko, who in silent darkness manages to climb the walls.

In fact, in the most difficult moments, in the face of the most threatening dangers, in front of unknown scenarios, you have to rely on your strengths and try unpublished strategies, where traditional techniques can nothing.
