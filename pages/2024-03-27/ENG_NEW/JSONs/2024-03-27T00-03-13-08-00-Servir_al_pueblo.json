The reason was the alleged \"unauthorized\" use of audiovisual content owned by bourgeois press monopolies. That is, they ensure that their programs were shared \u201cillegally\u201d by some channels of the Telegram messaging application.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-08ed5691e8d7a52012111ceb471af0e6\">\n  Given this accusation, the instruction judge ordered, in a precautionary way, to close the use of the messaging application while the investigation will be carried out. However, given the lack of compliance with the company, computer operators were decided to temporarily block the telegram connection in the Spanish State. The argument used by the judge is that, while the content is housed in the application, it is not excess of being able to complete the application.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bb4deed8c186d3e6af860b9f19f9ccb3\">\n  Although at no time did it stop working, and today March 25, the judge himself has reversed and has paralyzed his closure while the investigation lasts, being able to close in the future if the conviction is so decreed. Different \"justice\" organizations had made a complaint against the judge for serious, severe and unprecedented limitation of\n  <a href=\"https://theobjective.com/espana/tribunales/2024-03-25/denuncian-juez-pedraz-prevaricacion-telegram/\">\n   Fundamental rights\n  </a>\n  \u201d.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f1e1996b092227982268cce1d40d3cbe\">\n  Telegram is an application that in the Spanish State adds 8.5 million users, and is mainly known for its alleged greater security with respect to other instant messaging applications. This means that Telegram is not only used on a personal level, but that activist groups use this application as a method of disseminating their activities.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-362f066160efd3428dc8ea9ceb406033\">\n  Thus, this conviction, although not carried out at the moment, shows the tendency of the imperialist states to attack democratic rights. Prioritizing the \"right\" of the great communication monopolies to obtain economic revenue through their \"intellectual property\", it was aiming one of the most security applications that is known by the police that use the anti -fascist movements, of national liberation and of the movement for housing. These movements would have already been fiercely repressed through police infiltrations on several occasions, as we report in previous\n  <a href=\"https://heraldorojo.org/2023/09/08/espana-destapada-nueva-infiltracion-policial-en-madrid/\">\n   occasions\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e3af5a42d139e76f05a58c5bb8a8031f\">\n  No application is completely safe. However, it is no accident that it has been indicated directly to Telegram, where political content is shared by different organizations. Moreover, when Telegram had already collaborated with the European bourgeois \"justice\" in a similar case (protection of \"intellectual rights\").\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <span id=\"wordads-inline-marker\" style=\"display: none;\">\n </span>\n</div>", "source": "https://serviralpuebloperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/26/el-estado-espanol-da-marcha-atras-en-la-prohibicion-de-telegram/", "type": "article", "title": "The Spanish state turns back in the prohibition of Telegram", "description": "On March 23, the news was known that a judge of the National Court, the court that has jurisdiction throughout the state, ordered the complete closure of Telegram in the country to Caus\u2026", "modified time": "2024-03-26T16:03:13+00:00", "author": ["Servir al pueblo"], "source_name": "Servir al pueblo"}
