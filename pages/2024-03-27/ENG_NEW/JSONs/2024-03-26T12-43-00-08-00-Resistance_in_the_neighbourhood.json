Prosecution that is integrated into its political criminalization of strikes in order to pass the evaluation to the public school. That is, to implement the policy that strikes the right to free education and promotes a more class of school for few and \"chosen\", with teachers of pupils, without rights. It is a continuation of the government -prosecution pogrom, state violence and repression against the struggles of teachers, students, workers, in progress.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n They impose a climate of fascism, criminalize trade union action aimed at terrorizing, silencing any voice of resistance, but mainly target workers and all the people to bend their heads and accept the policy of poverty, poverty and participation in the country. Wars of imperialists as \"regularity\".\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The government and the parties of the system that support its policy will not stop unless we stop them with our mass struggles. We need to unfold struggles against the barbaric policy that impoverishes us, but also against persecution and state violence and repression. Let the persecution and the climate of terror not pass. With our joint concerted struggles we can put the brakes on those who deprive us of our rights to life and mortgage our lives for the interests of the ruling class and its imperialist protectors.\n <br/>\n <ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Down the hands of clubs, clubs and fighters!\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    To stop all the persecutions now\n   </b>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n Chania, 25-03-2024\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Resistance Initiative\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2!"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7", "\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac", "\u03b4\u03b9\u03c9\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2", "\u03b5\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7", "\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9", "\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_26.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
