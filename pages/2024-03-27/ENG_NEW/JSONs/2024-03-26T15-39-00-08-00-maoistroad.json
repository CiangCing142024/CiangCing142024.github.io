Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes\n\tafter 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and\n\tnative elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the\n\towners of the significant number of means of production of the\n\tcountry implemented distorted development industrial policy that\n\tbenefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial\n\tpolicy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population\n\tof India.\n      </p>\n      <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n       With the entry of\n\tfinance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast\n\tscale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people\n\thappened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India\n\tcontinued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than\n\tbefore. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,\n\tIndian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and\n\tPrivatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk\n\tfor the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian\n\tresources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All\n\tparliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their\n\tparty flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has\n\tbroken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable\n\tmisery to the toiling masses.\n      </p>\n      <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n       <br p=\"\"/>\n       <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n        <br>\n         Development\n\tin India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed\n\tpeople. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for\n\tcheap natural resources that are available in the third world\n\tcountries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that\n\tmainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To\n\tplunder the\n         <br/>\n         resources of India, Imperialism has backed every\n\tfascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of\n\tIndia. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the\n\tIndian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried\n\tout several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,\n\tSendera, Operation Green-\n         <br/>\n         Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it\n\thas unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of\n\tindigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global\n\tfinance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden\n\tstate, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to\n\tfascist political system in India. Massive\n         <br/>\n         deployments of\n\tmilitary forces are going on in Central India to expedite the\n\tplunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's\n\tresistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,\n\tlands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state\n\tunder the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry\n\thorrific\n         <br/>\n         news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It\n\tis not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop\n\tuntil and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is\n\tuprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on\n\tthe massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in\n\tLatin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has\n         <br/>\n         developed more\n\tbrutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the\n\tstruggling masses.

Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes\n\tafter 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and\n\tnative elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the\n\towners of the significant number of means of production of the\n\tcountry implemented distorted development industrial policy that\n\tbenefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial\n\tpolicy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population\n\tof India.\n         </p>\n         <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n          With the entry of\n\tfinance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast\n\tscale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people\n\thappened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India\n\tcontinued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than\n\tbefore. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,\n\tIndian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and\n\tPrivatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk\n\tfor the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian\n\tresources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All\n\tparliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their\n\tparty flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has\n\tbroken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable\n\tmisery to the toiling masses.\n         </p>\n         <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n          <br p=\"\"/>\n          <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n           <br>\n            Development\n\tin India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed\n\tpeople. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for\n\tcheap natural resources that are available in the third world\n\tcountries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that\n\tmainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To\n\tplunder the\n            <br/>\n            resources of India, Imperialism has backed every\n\tfascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of\n\tIndia. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the\n\tIndian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried\n\tout several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,\n\tSendera, Operation Green-\n            <br/>\n            Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it\n\thas unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of\n\tindigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global\n\tfinance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden\n\tstate, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to\n\tfascist political system in India. Massive\n            <br/>\n            deployments of\n\tmilitary forces are going on in Central India to expedite the\n\tplunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's\n\tresistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,\n\tlands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state\n\tunder the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry\n\thorrific\n            <br/>\n            news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It\n\tis not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop\n\tuntil and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is\n\tuprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on\n\tthe massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in\n\tLatin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has\n            <br/>\n            developed more\n\tbrutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the\n\tstruggling masses.
