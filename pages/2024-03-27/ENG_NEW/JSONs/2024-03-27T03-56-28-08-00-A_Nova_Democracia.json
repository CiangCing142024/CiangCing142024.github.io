At the time, they denounced the neglect of years and years by the City of Guarulhos and previous administrations to maintain the place. After a storm in December 2023, blocks 6 and 13 were harshly affected by detachment and are suffering serious structural and sanitary risks. Residents also deal with lack of light and severe infiltration in the apartments.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The meeting debated the origin of the date, female oppression, and, within this, domestic work and class character of the \u201cWomen's Day\u201d, truly international day of proletarian women, pointing out the differences between the conditions of exploiting women and those working women. There was also the popular struggle as a mandatory way to achieve their liberation.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-171544\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-1024x768.jpg\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-300x225.jpg 300w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-768x576.jpg 768w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-60x45.jpg 60w\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-1024x768.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_20240324_175323-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Complaints were made during a women's meeting to celebrate 8/3.

Many residents boycott the collection in protest against the misuse of money. Most previous liquidators have committed screaming cases of corruption, such as selling apartments, stealing from cash, not reporting spending, and missing the payment of cleaning, maintenance, and concierge. For this reason, there are processes in the name of the condominium that total more than R $ 200 thousand.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When a storm caused blocks 6 and 13, the last liquidator prohibited a report to report it, claiming that it was necessary not to give a breach to talk about labor proceedings. She also worked in the neighboring private condominium called Dunas, is related to a police officer, and barred the activities of the Popular Solidarity Student Committee (CESP), promoted by students of the Public College in front (Unifesp).

Several points of the ceiling have leaks fed by the puddles on the terrace.
