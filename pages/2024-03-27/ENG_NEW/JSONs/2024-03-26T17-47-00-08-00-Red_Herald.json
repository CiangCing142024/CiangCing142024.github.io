In this attack more than 300 people were killed. Also it is the deadliest attack in Moscow since the apartment bombings in 1999, which ended with the loss of life of almost 300 people. Both cases were responses to the Russian imperialism\u2019s repressive police and the atrocities committed by it against the Caucasus\u2019 peoples. There, Chechnya became a combatant territory against the Russian State.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <a href=\"https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/02/russia-is-down-but-not-out-in-central-asia/\">\n    The list of crimes of Soviet social-imperialism\n   </a>\n   and Russian imperialism in Central Asia is very long: the invasion of Afghanistan was one of the biggest crimes they made in a long time, with a military occupation and the repression against the Afghan people, which last for almost a decade. Afterwards the involvement in the Tajikistan\u2019s civil war between 1992 and 1997 was another of the Russian imperialist interventions in the region, and thus, the maintenance of the control of the Russian imperialism in the region, being Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan two of the more oppressed countries by Russian imperialism in the area. Another country which suffered the Russian iron fist was Kazakhstan, which after the strong protests in 2022, saw a Russian military intervention in the same year in order to maintain the status quo. All of this, along with the wars in Chechnya\n   <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russias-muslim-strategy-foreign-policy/\">\n    were crimes which were seen by the Muslim population as attacks\n   </a>\n   against its identity, and therefore brought Russian imperialism to be seen as an specially reactionary element against its peoples. Additionally the Muslim population in Moscow, coming from oppressed nations and peoples, has denounced increasing attacks and Islamophobia since its migration to the Russian capital skyrocketed since the 90\u2019s.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The crimes from Russian imperialism has been relevant in many other places against Muslim population, as\n   <a href=\"https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/time-its-personal-russias-foreign-policymaking-middle-east\">\n    in the military interventions and support to local lackeys\n   </a>\n   in Africa and Middle East, in the wars of Libya, Syria, massacres committed and support to the local lackeys\u2019 regimes in Mali, Niger, Center-African Republic, Sudan or Burkina Faso. Or event with the increasing collusion with some of the local ruling classes of Middle East, as with United Arab Emirates with which they collaborate in Sudan, as we\n   <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2024/03/22/war-torn-sudan-heading-for-disaster/\" title=\"\">\n    recently reported\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This policy of aggressions and repression against the oppressed peoples and nations of the world \u2013 some of them, currently as in the Caucasus, under Russian direct military occupation -, shows how Russian imperialism is a big oppressor of the peoples from the world. Many of these peoples share the Islamic religion, some that has been used by organizations as ISIS-K and diverse insurgent groups, to lead the masses\u2019 wrath against Russian imperialism. This also shows a historical reality of the imperialist interventions, and it is,\n   <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/23/europe/moscow-concert-hall-attack-analysis-intl-cmd\">\n    when they bring war abroad, then the war comes back home\n   </a>\n   . The Soviet social-imperialism, and after it, Russian imperialism, brought war to the homes of Afghan people, and to the homes of the Caucasus, Africa, Middle East peoples\u2026 and after all of this came back in form of multiple armed actions in Russian territory and in form of insurgency in these territories. All of this points out that, despite that,\n   <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2024/02/26/two-years-of-russian-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine/\" title=\"\">\n    as we reported\n   </a>\n   , Russian imperialism is achieving to slowly advance in its main current challenge, which is the imperialist war of aggression against Ukraine, and it is still being a relevant actor in the international scenario, and that it is not almighty. The brutal repression in the internal level and the great military power have not been enough, showing once again that imperialism is a paper tiger when it oppresses and faces the peoples from the world.\n  </p>\n </p>\n</div>", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/03/26/attack-of-the-isis-k-in-moscow-the-war-comes-back-to-the-russias-heart/", "type": "article", "title": "Attack of the ISIS-K in Moscow: \u201cThe war comes back\u201d to Russia\u2019s heart \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "This Friday night of 22nd of March four armed men carried out an attack with assault rifles and incendiary devices in Krasnogorsk, Moscow\u2019s metropolitan area, in the concert hall Crocus City Hall, where a concert was being held, where thousands of people had gathered.", "modified time": "2024-03-26T09:54:46+00:00", "author": ["A.R."], "categories": ["Asia", "Europe", "Featured"], "tags": ["Russia"], "sections": ["Asia", "Europe", "Featured", "Russia", "English", "pll_66029889f063e"], "source_name": "Red Herald"}
