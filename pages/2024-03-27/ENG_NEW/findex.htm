In the first part of the General Assembly, Cihan Uğural of the FNV union and Lyra participated as a speaker on behalf of Revolutionare Eenheid), panel on the status of the working class and economic and political course after the elections in the Netherlands.
 </p>
<p>
  In the following Board, the 27th Atik Congress continued with the reading and discussion of the Perspective article. One point in this discussion was that the discourses of the existing left parties became alive and that there was a need for a new left party. Many people had the idea that the Federation had to carry out a party to establish a party with local democratic institutions and organizations.
 </p>
<p>
  After the activity report was read and submitted to the approval of the delegates at the General Assembly held on Sunday, March 24, the audit and financial report continued.

   This year the campaign has a special character in the face of the antipopular ons unemployment and the gigantic mobilization of January 24. AND
   <u>
    l
   </u>
   8M, women have given another cheek to this policy and the protocol of Patricia Bullrich with huge mobilizations throughout the country. The Omnibus law fell and the mega decree has been rejected in the Senate.
  </p>
<p>
   The gigantic mobilization of March 24 in repudiation of the genocidal dictatorship, to the denialism of Milei and Villarruel means a new advance in the unity and struggle of the people against the government's adjustment and delivery policy.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>
     *
    </strong>
</span>
   We face this policy in the streets with the colleagues of the currents in which we work and others
   <em>
    opposition sectors
   </em>
   . At the same time we continue listening and arguing with many
   <em>
    voters of mercy
   </em>
   , a part of which is already going through your policy. The struggles exacerbate government contradictions, above and with their voters.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    With the
    <em>
     hoy
    </em>
    and the spark magazine, of our youth,
   </strong>
   We have to go out to play in those currents to advance a revolutionary current in its bosom and, at the same time, fill the party and the youth of arguments for that dispute by promoting its collective reading and discussion, in all the organizations and groups of readers, readers, multiplying them. Organic functioning is essential to integrate reading into the reality of each place and the plans of the organisms; with the horizon of achieving our strategic objectives, which must preside over our tactic and be part of it.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
     *
    </span>
    It is essential
   </strong>
   For this we arrive weekly with the newspaper in hand to all affiliates and that they also carry, below the arm, the
   <strong>
<em>
     hoy
    </em>
</strong>
   to offer it at each meeting and in each discussion we have. Around that work with the newspaper is how the party is structured
   <strong>
    .
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
     *
    </span>
    The month of the press will be made with the editions of April 10, 17 and 24 and May 1 and 8
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
     *
    </span>
    The cost of the copy from April 10 will be $ 600 at the price of a lid and 800 at a solidarity price. It is very important to make solidarity subscriptions to help the self -teaching of the newspaper.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
     *
    </span>
    Discuss the proposals and advance from now with the planning in the agencies, making the "map" thinking about our strategic objectives, with concrete but broad lists to arrive with the press in the campaign and solving which partner will see each one from the list, will help to achieve a month of the successful, numerical and organizational press.

  On March 24, Federal Deputy Chiquinho Brazão (former Union/RJ), the Counselor of the Rio de Janeiro State Court of Auditors (TCE-RJ), Domingos Brazão and the Civil Police delegate Rivaldo Barbosa were arrested by Federal Police accused of involvement in the execution of Councilwoman Marielle Franco. Both Brazão brothers were pointed out as masterminds of the crime, while Barbosa was accused of planning the murder.
 </p>
<p>
  The names add to those of former PMS Ronnie Lessa, Marielle's killer, and Élcio de Queiroz, driver of the car on the day of execution. The accusations to the Brazão and Barbosa brothers reveal new layers of the execution of the case of Marielle Franco and the interests behind the execution; On the other hand, questions are still open.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Who are the new accused of involvement in the crime
 </h4>
<p>
  Domingos Brazão is the head of the Brazão political clan in Rio de Janeiro. Former state deputy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazão became TCE-RJ counselor in 2015. Brazão has already been the target of different investigations, from voting to fraud, administrative misconduct, homicides, corruption and, in the case of Marielle, Obstruction of justice (accused in 2019) and now principal. Already Chiquinho Brazão, Domingos's brother, carries a similar political life. According to investigations, it was Chiquinho who had more direct confrontations with Marielle. The PF points out that Chiquinho via Marielle as a hindrance to approve a project in the City Council related to land regularization.
 </p>
<p>
  The other involved in the crime, Rivaldo Barbosa, has a long career in the Civil Police. He became delegated in 2010. In 2018, he assumed the head of the Civil Police.
  <strong>
   Strangely, Rivaldo assumes the head of the institution, which would investigate the political crime against Marielle, on the eve of the murder
  </strong>
  . The responsible for the appointment was General Braga Netto, who at the time was an intervener in the public security of Rio de Janeiro. That year, the Eastern Military Command, headed by Braga Netto, exercised full command on all public safety. Braga Netto says that who named him was the Secretary of Public Security, also appointed by Braga Netto, General Richard Nunes.
 </p>
<p>
  Named in full military intervention, Barbosa was responsible for planning "meticulously" the murder, and prevents disrupting investigations after the crime. During the plans, Barbosa even asked the principals that the crime would not be made in the City Council. After the execution, Barbosa approached Marielle's family and maintained narrow contact with the relatives of the murdered councilwoman, gaining the "confidence" of the mournings.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The political motivation of the crime is not clarified: who is the political mentor?
 </h4>
<p>
  Land grabbing, land regularization and real estate speculation were elevated in the case as motivations for the crime. According to the investigation, the trigger would have been a bill in the City Council, against which Marielle Franco voted in 2017. The project, nº174/2016, would benefit the mafias that control clandestine buildings in Jacarepaguá, and Marielle sought to allocate certain areas to popular construction projects. The PL was approved, in fact benefiting the "militias". By voting against, Marielle would have become a target.
 </p>
<p>
  The first incongruity that appears is: Marielle became target for voting against… a bill that was approved? Muffy groups even had Marielle kill in downtown Rio de Janeiro, in full military intervention and with the eyes of the world around the public safety problem in Rio de Janeiro (therefore, the high risk of exposure and attract all the attention of the interveners to you)? Is that, because of a parliamentary vote in an article where the mafias came out? It does not seem reasonable.
 </p>
<p>
  The crime, in the context, the form and where it was executed, not to mention the nature of the execution, indicate a political crime with the purpose of
  <strong>
   draw attention
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   destabilize
  </strong>
  ; which does not seem to fit the course of the investigation, which points to a crime for economic motivations, whose objective is, by nature,
  <strong>
   unnotic
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, the investigation (given by the current Minister of Justice, Ricardo Lewandowski) ignores some evidence and relationships.
 </p>
<p>
  First: Why Rivaldo Barbosa was nominated
  <strong>
   one day earlier
  </strong>
  of the execution of Marielle Franco by the intervening generals?
 </p>
<p>
  Second: Why did Rivaldo's appointment occurred, even though he was contraindicated by military intelligence for considering him suspected of not being unlawful?
 </p>
<p>
  THIRD: Why, during military intervention, there was so much explicit interference, and did not take action?
 </p>
<p>
  Fourth: Why not investigate the murder of Adriano da Nóbrega, a member of the “Crime Office” in 2020, during a strange police operation in Bahia, denounced as a “file burning” operation by his wife? Why was he killed, just when he was investigated for involvement in Marielle's death? Why not investigate the relationships that Adriano da Nobrega had with Flávio Bolsonaro, even having his wife and mother employed in the office of Bolsonaro's son? Why does no one say that Bolsonaro himself had visited Adriano da Nobrega when he was arrested in 2004-2005?
 </p>
<p>
  Fifth: Why the testimony of the porter of the condominium Vivendas da Barra was not resumed, according to which, on March 14, 2018 (
  <strong>
   Marielle's execution day!
  </strong>
  ), Élcio de Queiroz, the driver on the night of the crime, entered the condominium, stating his name in the visitors book, having headed to House 58, whose owner is Jair Bolsonaro? I.e,
  <strong>
   Why the investigation did not find out if Élcio de Queiroz went to Bolsonaro's house on the day of the attack, as said the condominium doorman!?
  </strong>
  The porter, who said this in 2019, when Bolsonaro was president, was pressured and turned back in his statements. But why didn't the investigations return to this testimony, seeking to investigate this information? Why?
 </p>
<p>
  Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said that "the works are closed" and that the case was a "victory of the Brazilian state". But why are it seeing that the true motives and guilty of the crime are escaping unpunished?

<strong>
   First part
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Appearing from the struggles of the source Brazilian proletariat and under the influx of the Bolshevik Revolution, but founded by militants, mostly, graduates of Anarcho-Syndicalism in the process of bankruptcy in the country, the Communist Party will be marked in its early years, still by inheritance and reminiscences of this ideology. Founded as a Communist Party, and though admitted soon at the Communist International, to be as such, as a Marxist-Leninist Party, will travel a long and complex path without, however, achieving it.
 </p>
<p p="">
<h4>
<span class="entretitulo">
    First step
   </span>
</h4>
<p>
   In the struggle to assimilate Marxism-Leninism, struggling to overcome the anarcho-syndicalistic heritage of most of its founders and the obreist and economic conceptions, the party will face the theoretical challenge of understanding the peculiar reality of the countries dominated by imperialism, which It drags on the secular delay of pre-capitalist relations, slavery and semi-feudality.
  </p>
<p>
   In an attempt to break with economicism will take the shortcut of electoral reformism by organizing the Peasant Workers Block (BOC), backwards with the harsh criticism made by the IC. In the first eight years, he will hold three congresses, and in spite of the theoretical efforts of his paintings, all were marked by the false, not to say naive, thesis of agent versus industrialism. Thesis that advocated that the country was governed by an alleged contradiction within the ruling classes, which opposed the maintenance of the agrarian system to an industrializing process. In the same error it incurred the thesis that characterized the then stage of the Brazilian Revolution by Democratic-Peokie-Burgueis.
  </p>
<p>
   Although the country lived the consequences of the crisis of overcoming the bankruptcy of the domination of the old slave oligarchies and was shaken from above by democratic-bourgeois revolutionary movements, the party could not star in this very rich revolutionary situation, devoid of scientific understanding about Brazilian society and a proletarian ideological line. The party struggles were restricted to retail problems due to the weak management of historical dialectical materialism and the mass line to understand the national reality.
  </p>
<p>
   The party was practically absent and distant from turbulent events guided by democratic-bourgeois aspirations, in which the most active sectors of the small bourgeoisie were beating in military movements for the simple exchange of mandates in the country (tenentism, prestes column and liberal alliance-““ “ Revolution of 30 ”). This was a historical period of the effervescent revolutionary situation aborted by the armed movement that succeeded the Liberal Alliance of Vargas and assaulted the state power, betraying the democratic-bourgeois aspirations of the movements started with the so-called tenentist movement and culminated in the demobilization of the column Prestes.
  </p>
<h4>
<span class="entretitulo">
    Second stage
   </span>
</h4>
<p>
   The 1930s will mark the beginning of a new stage of the party's life. Step that, due to its zigzagging characteristic between left and right in its orientation, will develop from the popular uprising of 35, culminating in the V Revisionist Congress of 1960. It goes through the crisis of disaggregation after the 37 STATE coup and reorganization with CNOP
   <sup>

</sup>
   In 1943, for the struggle for Brazil to enter the war against Nazi-fascism alongside the allies, for the short life in legality (1945/46), by the 1948 Manifesto, the Manifesto of August 1950, by the important IV Congress (December /54-Janela/55), by the March 1958 declaration. This long stage of thirty years is marked by a permanent zigzag, which although it does not slightly establish a proletarian ideological line, will fertilize the terrain for the development of the two fight Lines based on the fight against reformism and later on modern revisionism with the party's reconstruction.
  </p>
<p>
   Although the party had advanced considerably in the assimilation of the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism, raising its ability to analyze the Brazilian reality, it will be deeply influenced by the springs of theses of modern revisionism, markedly browndores
   <sup>
<a id="3" name="3" title="3">
</a>
<a href="#n3">

    </a>
</sup>
   . Theses of “Peace and Democracy”, “Convergence between Socialism and Capitalism”, which strengthen the electoral opportunism and the dilution of the party in a “democratic front”, flattening the way to sinking and rotting in Kruchovista revisionism and the reformist opportunism of Committee direction of the following decades.
  </p>
<p>
   In 1935, thirteen years of its founding only, the party makes a quality leap in its process by establishing, in connection with the international communist movement, the path to taking power through armed struggle. At this stage, when the forces of fascism had risen in Europe, the Communist International developed new theses with the single working class to face its expansion and conjure the world imperialist war that was already gestated.
  </p>
<p>
   In Brazil, under the party's direction was organized the ANL - National Liberating Alliance, a single front of revolutionary classes that proposed by the establishment of a revolutionary popular government, to confiscate imperialism, the great bourgeoisie and the semi -feudal landlord. The party already understood the character of the Brazilian revolution as democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist agrarian as a necessary stage for socialism.
  </p>
<p>
   In a moment that has become a marketing milestone in our country and our proletariat, the party will carry out an armed survey to seize power. In it, the party will incur two fundamental errors: one strategic and one of tactical character. In the strategic, he had not understood the role of the peasantry and this was a derivation of not understanding the process of social classes in colonial, semicolonial and semi -feudal countries.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    Already with the damage of the strategic error of completely disregarding the field, in the tactical the error was irreversible. To the extent that Getúlio Vargas's government had struck Anl throwing it illegally, isolating the party temporarily, the insurrection plans were still maintained. This made what was already difficult, in a defeat of strategic proportion to the Brazilian proletariat. The reaction not only stifled the armed uprising, but also removed from the episode all the raw material to amalgamar the discourse of counterrevolution, which will be used to this day (the “communist intent”). Events embellish a paradox. Just as it was a transcendental moment of our history, in which the still very young and inexperienced proletarian party, driving a front of revolutionary classes (ANL) throws itself into the seizure of power, the defeat of the uprising will engender a deep reformism, lethal to lethal the lethal party in the following decades.
   </p>
<p p="">
<p>
     Thus, the party hindered by the Selvagery of the Estado Fascist of Vargas, will adopt incorrect policies of submission of the proletariat to the great bourgeoisie and the paths of electoral opportunism. For with the end of World War II, with the prestige of the USSR and the communists on the rise in the world, the party, which had come out of strengthened clandestinity, instead of dwelling on the preparation tasks to trigger the struggle for the seizure of power, will get drunk on constitutional illusions. Despite the great success in the elections for the 46 constituent was soon struck harshly, once again. Back in clandestinity and violently persecuted, he begins, with the January manifesto 48, a self -critical balance of legalistic illusions.
    </p>
<p>
     But even under the cruel persecution of the bureaucratic-latifight state of imperialism, especially Yankee, the party seeks to overcome such right deviations, fierce dogmatically to the European conceptions of insurrection and the mechanistic understanding of the Bolshevik Revolution, will completely despise the teachings. of the Chinese Revolution and the gigantic contributions of Mao Tsetung.
    </p>
<p>
     Although the theses of the IV Congress, formulated on the wake of the August 50 Manifesto, armed by the armed way to take power, the party will move to a radical discourse without being able to lead him fully to practice. The fact that follows without understanding who was who in the Brazilian bourgeoisie, of not understanding the double character of the national bourgeoisie (medium bourgeoisie) and continuing to take the bureaucratic fraction of the great Brazilian bourgeoisie by national bourgeoisie, besides continuing in practice despising the peasantry, It will be the land conducive to new turn on the right. Despite being considered leftist by several currents, the IV Congress will ultimately favor the prevailing old opportunism, assimilated after the defeat in the popular uprising of 35, of the right -wing line on the conception of the democratic revolution, this time under the flag of “National Union”.
    </p>
<p>
     On the grounds of the alleged leftism of the IV Congress and in the face of demonstrations of discontent with his resolutions, Prestes pulling to the right, as a self -criticism of the “leftism of the IV Congress” that will attack the government of Vargas, will support the defense of the policy of Support Juscelino Kubitschek's candidacy.
    </p>
<p>
     As soon as the revolutionary positions, albeit insufficient, accumulated in the IV Congress, were destroyed and crushed, serving as a right support point to attack any truly revolutionary conception, and drag the party once again to the swamp of opportunism. With the results of the 20th PCU Congress (1956), all the opportunism already rooted in the party gained coverage and theoretical foundations. As well stated later Manuel Lisboa

     : "The decisions of the XX Congress of the PCUS only came to give legal and moral coverage to the reformism of the party." With the famous March 58 statement the Revisionist group of Prestes will prepare the land on which the V Congress in 1960 will consolidate in the party the theses of Kruschov's modern reformism and revisionism. Such a statement deserved the hardest and most striking criticism of Maurício Grabois

Manuel Lisboa fought revisionism and expressed his positions in the important letter of 12 points to the revolutionary communists, with which he sustained the essential conceptions of Maoism for the Brazilian Revolution synthesizing that “the core of the strategy of the proletariat and his party is the Popular War through the war of guerrillas ”. Manuel Lisboa was brutally murdered in 1972, after more than 18 days of torture in the holdings of the military regime in Recife.

      Third step

<p>
     The V Congress in 1960 will be preceded by intense struggle within the party. Revisionists headed by Prestes did not tolerate the internal struggle and expelled most of those who did not accept coward attacks against Stalin. Still the fight against opportunism gains breath. Pedro Pomar will head, in the debates of the V Congress, the attack on the opportunistic theses of national reformism. In 1962, the paintings that conform to the revolutionary field will carry out the struggle to purify the party of the Revisionist Group of Prestes. Being in minority promoting the determined split with the revisionists, starting the process of party reconstruction. This event will mark the beginning of a new and third stage in the party's history, the richest and most important stage of its maturation that, in theory and practice, P.C.B. (Now under the acronym of PCdoB, to differentiate itself from the revisionist group) will indeed be constituted as a Marxist-Leninse Communist Party.
    </p>
<p>
     It is relevant to highlight that the party was one of the first in the world to openly fight Kruchov's betrayal positions. Mauricio Grabois's letter to Kruchov, in which he attacks his revisionist positions and in defense of Stalin, led Kruchov to attack the Brazilian communists, citing them in the debates that came up with the
     <strong>
      Chinese letter
     </strong>
<a href="#n1">

</a>
     In 1963. Also, prior to the 5th Congress (1960), Pedro Pomar, present at the Congress of the Communist Party of Romania, rejected the attacks on the leaders of the Albanian Labor Party, absent from that event, made by Kruchov who had accused them of adventurerism.
    </p>
<p>
     This will be the stage in which the party will live, for the first time, the open struggle against modern revisionism, as it approaches the thought Mao Tsetung (as was called Maoism at the time). Moment when the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism will gain worldwide dimension. Mao, ahead of this great battle, will unmask Kruchov's opportunism as modern revisionism, systematizing it in the formula of the “three peaceful” and the “two all”
     <sup>
<a id="2" name="2" title="2">
</a>
<a href="#n2">
       2
      </a>
</sup>
     . In the same period the party will also have to combat the opportunism of “left”, emerged as a reaction to the pacifism of the group of Prestes (ALN by Carlos Marighella, MR8, PCBR, etc., and other processes such as VPR, Polop, etc. ).
    </p>
<p p="">
<p>
      This will be a serious problem of the revolutionary movement in spite of all heroism revealed by so many combatants in the armed struggle against pro-trial fascist military management. PCdoB will also have to combat the opportunism of “left”, revealing it as a form of expression of Kruchovista revisionism in Latin America (armed revisionism)
      <sup>
<a href="#n3">
        3
       </a>
</sup>
<a id="3" name="3" title="3">
</a>
      . However, the party will not be able to get rid of serious deviations such as dogmatism. The direction of PCdoB, formed by experienced communist frames, although he assumed the thought Mao Tsetung, did so formally and stagnuting the internal struggle. Will not understand something essential of Maoism, the struggle of two lines

      , as the correct method of forging the party. Such misunderstanding will be crucial to prevent the party from assimilating the maoism fully.
     </p>
<p>
      It will not examine and understand the true origins of reformism in the party. It will follow without the correct understanding of the Brazilian bourgeoisie, its fractions and role in the class struggle. Although the PCdoB proposed the Maoist strategy of surrounding the city from the countryside, that is, to take the peasantry as the main force in the first stage of our revolution, it will not understand that, where the fundamental contradictions and the main contradictions were most condensed in the country. , it was the Northeast Region and not the North, where it would focus the main strategic force.
     </p>
<p>
      Upon understanding and not practicing the fight of two lines, not only led to the fractionation of the party (PCR under the leadership of Manoel Lisboa and Amaro Luiz de Carvalho, Capivara, and PCdoB Red Ala

      ), as impossible to develop direction in the correct understanding of the conception of the Popular War. And this was the background of the Araguaia guerrilla defeat, as well as the blocking of its critical balance in the party and consequently capitulation and complete rot from the death of most revolutionary paintings.
     </p>
<p>
      Important party documents will mark this period of the third stage in the party's history:

<p>
      Due to the total misunderstanding on the question of the fight of two lines by the party direction, the defeat of the Araguaia guerrillas and the sabotage of the struggle for the correct balance of such an important experience, added to the elimination of the best communist frames, completed with the episode of Lap

      (1976), the capitulation will be inevitable. The capitulation of the revolutionary line of the popular war headed by the direction of João Amazonas led the party to conversion to revisionism and its complete liquidation as a Marxist-Leninist party, turning it into another opportunistic organization under the continuation of the acronym PCdoB.
     </p>
<p>
      This capitulatory line, led by João Amazonas, as a denial of the revolutionary path, could only settle in the party after the elimination of the main communist paintings in the direction, supporters of the path of revolutionary armed struggle. Without more prepared paintings to combat revisionist subterfuge, Amazonas will find the free way to pass the open and declared attack on Maoism by following the Dogmatic-Revisionist line of Ver Hoxha

      , the party was converted into another revisionist opportunistic party. It will turn a heroic revolutionary experience of previous years into a dead icon, now used only as a "trophy" to keep deceiving youth in search of political militancy. It will then completely integrate with the official life of the old Brazilian state, in legalism, electoralism and parliamentary cretinism to the degenerate situation that is found today as part of the old pro-imperialist bureaucratic order, as an auxiliary force for management of Luiz Inacio's shift.
     </p>
<p>
      The events that will mark 1976 will be even more dramatic for the revolutionary movement around the world. With the bourgeois restoration in China, promoted by Teng Siao-Mapan's coup d'état, which will lead to the bloody massacre of the Maoist paintings, a long time ends, the first major wave of the world proletarian revolution, announced by the publication of the manifesto do Communist Party, in 1848, marked by the Paris Commune of 1871 as its “General Essay” and driven with the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. In Brazil, the twists on PCdoB in the years following the dramatic episode of Lapa, liquidating it while Revolutionary party, it will culminate a whole rich phase of the third stage of the party's history.

        The self -criticism of

</h4>
<p>
       When his return to the country in 1979, Luiz Carlos Prestes broke with the organization he had directed for almost 40 years. Unable to change the ideological-political positions already so crystallized in that group, in an exemplary self-critical effort, launched his letter to the communists, in a call to resume the revolutionary path. Without a doubt this gesture is demonstrative of his communist condition, but the content of his self-criticism, which politically gives a spin to the left, in the ideological was very limited. He maintained the same hostility to Stalin and his direction taken from the Kruschovista revisionism chest and did not even consider the extraordinary experience of the Chinese revolution, the one that was the highest level of the world proletarian revolution - the great proletarian cultural revolution - and even less to the great ideologist and Communist leader Mao Tsetung.
      </p>
<p p="">
<h4>
<span class="entretitulo">
         Fighting for the party's reconstitution must be the task of proletarian revolutionaries
        </span>
</h4>
<p>
        As important as the economic struggles of workers, salary increases and in defense of rights, will result in failure if they do not have the destruction of every order of the old bureaucratic state. Only with the building of a new power, a new democracy that expresses the interests of the oppressed classes and based on the workers' covenant, which confiscates all lands of the latifundal, the capitals of the great bourgeoisie and imperialism will guarantee the transition to socialism. And this depends on the existence of a true revolutionary party of the proletariat. This is the lesson that gives us the history of the communist movement in the world and in Brazil. In the matter of the existence or not of an authentic party of the proletariat, the Communist Party, armed with a scientific ideology, lies the crucial point, whether or not the revolution in the country.
       </p>
<p>
        As an expression of the aggravation of the country's semicolonial condition, the growing and inevitable intensification of the popular struggle will end up imposed. In the midst of the struggles of the poor peasants by the Earth, against the semi -feudal landlord system, the resistance struggles of the working class, the students, the women of the people and other popular classes in the face of the state of misery and current obscurantism in our society, will develop the revolution . Just as popular resistance worldwide grows, new combatants of the proletariat and the people are certainly forged for new revolutionary battles across the country. Relentless struggles against all opportunism will gradually collect from disappointment with the scrutiny electoral process, corruption, unemployment and hunger and all other flagella that expresses the existing fake and democracy, the strength to lift the revolutionary movement and communist in Brazil.
       </p>
<p>
        The task of the Brazilian proletariat by his revolutionary party follows inconclusive. But it should not be understood as the creation of a brand new party, nor that of its "refounding", anti-dialectical and anti-historical versions that reject the historical process as a whole. The Communist Party was created in 1922 and crossed decades of tormentous and complex struggles, reached a high level of its constitution, but was settled as a revolutionary party. The question that arises for true proletarian revolutionaries, who have not broken or sold to the general offensive of the worldwide counterrevolution, is the task of reconstituting it. Reconstitute it as Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Communist Party.

He reviewed the Marxist-Leninist conception of the state, according to which this is a phenomenon of class society, being nothing more than “the special instrument of repression” of the ruling class. According to Kruchov's new revisionism the state in socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat, had lost the reason for being and became a state of “all people”, because in socialism there would be no more social classes. Consequently, for this conception, it was derived that in capitalist countries bourgeois democracy in its parliamentary form would cease to be the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, becoming the condition of all the people, and must be disputed and occupied peacefully by the proletariat.

     Mayson 
  Majidi, 27 years old, Kurdish director and activist, after the escape 
 from Iran and the journey by sea, it ended up in spite of himself in the 
 Cyclope, in a prison in Castrovillari in Calabria.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
     THE 
  Reasons why it had to escape are those shared by many others 
 people. Maysoon Majidi has become an uncomfortable figure in Iran after 
 The killing of Mahsa Amini, the 22 year old Kurdish killed by the police 
 Iranian.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
     TO 
  following the death of this young woman, symbol of rebellion 
 In power and victim of the Iranian moral police, there was a wave 
 of protests to which director Maysoon Majidi, together with other women, has 
 actively participated so as to become, in turn, a figure 
 uncomfortable for the Iranian government and risk imprisonment.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
     From 
  Here, in recent months, the escape from Iran and the arrival in Calabria on 31 
 December, where, a twist, he becomes for the prosecutor of Crotone a 
 "Suspect smuggler", an alleged trafficman of human lives, so with 
  This accusation, pending the trial, is locked up in the prison of 
 Castrovillari.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
     In 
  This case the unjust imprisonment does not completely go unnoticed, 
 As very often, however, it happens in the case of migrant people who 
 land on our coasts and end up forgotten in structures 
 prisoners of various types.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Mayson 
  Majidi, perhaps supported by the idea that the abuses suffered in Italy were 
 inconceivable in a democratic country, he continues to wonder: "
     <em>
      Because I'm here
     </em>
     [in carcere]?’’.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     This 
  It is the question that the Kurdish-Iranian activist continues to ask who are 
 visit because - seen with the eyes of those who run away from a regime for 
 fear of ending up in prison and then instead he finds himself held in it in 
 Italy, where he thought he could request international protection - 
 History takes on the characters of the nightmare that comes true.
    </span>

</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
     The 
  case of Maysoon is yet another demonstration of the hypocrisy of a class 
  politics that has pretended interest in the case of Mahsa Amini and the 
 Protests of Iranian women in order to make a drinking propaganda 
 Orientalist and Islamophobic, and then denying support to an activist 
 Kurdish-Iranian who fights against the abuse of the moral police.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Know 
  that Maysoon Majidi continues to be locked up in the prison of 
 Castrovillari is for us source of concern and indignation, and it is 
 For this reason that we have thought of activating ourselves, to make sure that 
  He does not remain alone to fight his battle in the Antro del 
 Cyclops.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
    Against
 the Cutro decree and in solidarity with Maysoon Majidi and all 
Those fleeing for their resistance and struggle are imprisoned 
In the prisons of the various countries, a demonstration will be held on March 26 in 
starting at 10.00 a.m. a demonstration in front of the Castrovillari prison.

<p>
  One of the judges of the
  <a href="https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2024-03-23/el-juez-pedraz-da-un-ultimatum-a-las-operadoras-para-bloquear-telegram-tras-la-denuncia-de-mediaset-atresmedia-y-movistar-plus.html">
   National Court
  </a>
  of the Spanish State, Santiago Pedraz, ordered to suspend the Telegram application due to possible copyright infringement.
 </p>
<p>
  On March 23, news broke that a judge of the National Court, the court that has jurisdiction over the entire State, ordered the complete shutdown of Telegram in the country because of a complaint by the big bourgeois press monopolies: Mediaset, Atresmedia and Movistar Plus. The reason was the alleged “unauthorized” use of audiovisual content owned by the bourgeois press monopolies. In other words, they claim that their programs were being shared “illegally” through some channels of the Telegram messaging application.
 </p>
<p>
  Faced with this accusation, the judge ordered, as a precautionary measure, to close the use of the messaging application while the investigation was being carried out. However, facing the company’s lack of compliance, it was decided to order the telecommunications operators to temporarily block Telegram’s connection in the Spanish State. The argument used by the judge is that, as long as the content is hosted on the application, it is not excess to completely close the application.
 </p>
<p>
  However, at no time did it cease to function, and today, March 25, the judge himself has reversed his decision and has paralyzed its closure for the duration of the investigation, being able to close it in the future if it is decreed by the conviction. Different “justice” organizations had filed a complaint against the judge for “serious, severe and unprecedented limitation of
  <a href="https://theobjective.com/espana/tribunales/2024-03-25/denuncian-juez-pedraz-prevaricacion-telegram/">
   fundamental rights
  </a>
  .”
 </p>
<p>
  Telegram is an application that has 8.5 million users in Spain, and is known for being supposedly more secure compared to other instant messaging applications. This means that Telegram is not only used on a personal level, but activist groups use this application as a method of disseminating their activities.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, this condemnation, although not carried out for the moment, shows the tendency of the imperialist States to attack democratic rights. By prioritizing the “right” of the big media monopolies to obtain economic profit through their “intellectual property”, it was targeting one of the applications most reliably known to the police to be used by the anti-fascist, national liberation and movements struggling for housing rights. These movements have already been fiercely repressed by police infiltration on several occasions, as we have reported on previous
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2023/09/08/spain-new-police-infiltration-in-madrid/">
   occasions
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  No application is completely secure. However, it is no coincidence that Telegram, where political content is shared by different organizations, has been directly targeted. Even more so, when Telegram had already collaborated with the European bourgeois “justice” in a similar case (protection of “intellectual rights”).

  Our comrades from Mexico City have carried out some actions demanding the presentation alive of Dr. Ernesto Sernas García, who has been missing since the 10

<p>
  From the 30

  Such murders of workers are unfortunately ubiquitous up and down the country. At Phantasialand in Brühl near Cologne, one of the largest amusement parks in Europe, an employee of the technical department was hit by a roller coaster during maintenance work on Monday and seriously injured in the head. The worker died a short time later at the scene of the accident. The murdered man was 43 years old.

  A worker was killed last Tuesday morning during construction work in Burghausen (Altötting district) in Upper Bavaria. The man was engaged in dredging work at around 7:15 a.m. on a factory site in Burgkirchener Straße. In the process, an excavator bit came loose from a 30-ton excavator, which hit the 57-year-old worker.

  Also last week, a technical worker from Upper Bavaria was killed in a train accident at a construction site of the Brenner Base Tunnel. The 57-year-old was engaged in surveying work in a construction phase in the Innsbruck area. At the same time, a transport train drove into the main tunnel and hit the man. An alerted emergency doctor could only determine death.

<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   working conditions

<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   . More than 400 workers die every year because they have to sell their workforce under adverse circumstances. On average, more than one worker in Germany dies per day through a so -called work “accident”.

<span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Such accidents always have the same cause: stress and hustle and bustle caused by the job buyers and a lack of occupational safety measures. Accordingly, such accidents cannot be characterized in any other way than murder.

           Drone attacks and surface bombing are no longer uncommon in many regions of India. On January 13 of this year, the third drone -based bombing against the Indian population was carried out over the course of just five days, most of which are concentrated in central Indian areas that are primarily inhabited by indigenous people (so -called adivasi). At the beginning of this year, another 3,000 military forces were moved to these areas, in addition to the 10,000 paramilitaries already stationed there. In the Abuj Maad region alone, where 35,000 people live, there are six military bases. Or in the Abujmarh region, here are three military forces on seven adivasi living there. The question seems obvious: Is India in war, is it attacked by another country?

           The forum against corporatism and militarization. “Which goes hand in hand with the military occupation of large parts of its own country. This war has been intensified by the new "Prahar" military campaign in particular in recent months. The "Operation Prahar" is part of the "Operation Samadhan", which was launched in 2017, which is managed as a counter -revolutionary operation, as a fight against the Indian State.

            “The similarity in the procedure between the armed forces and the paramilizers in the occupation of the country and the establishment of various paramilitary camps in one area reflects a common military orientation behind these activities. We believe that the Samadhan-Prahar operation is the embodiment of this military orientation and it is necessary to resist all over the country to stop this unrestrained militarization "

           In order to intensify the war against its own people, especially the bombings, the Indian Air Force has now purchased more than 30 Israeli Heron Mark 2 drones, which have so far been used mainly in Mali, Afghanistan and against the population in Gaza. India is now the world's largest buyer of weapons, as well as the largest buyer of Israeli weapons, including the Israeli spy software "Pegasus", which is used to spy on the mobile devices of the civilian population.

           The regions of India, in which the acts of war are now particularly tight with the Operation Prahar, are also those areas that are particularly resourceful and where the population has a long tradition of fighting the sale and robbery of their country. One of the centers of the operation is the Abujmarh region, in which various tribal communities live, and which, in addition to ore, lime and uranium, also includes an iron deposit of 700 million tons. However, these resources should not be reduced to use for the Indian population, but the Indian state does everything to drive away the population based there and to sell out the resources to international monopolies to the imperialists. That is why Facam also points out that militarization and corporatism go hand in hand:
          </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
            "The mobilization of paramilitaries by the Indian State in Operation Kagar is a highly alarming situation (...) whose core objective is to intensify the sell-off of India's raw materials while crushing any form of popular resistance."

           Corporitatism, as is currently particularly advanced by the Indian rulers, means the privatization (sale) of the so -called community (resources, forest, country, public services) under state control. And using the example of India, a semi -colonial and semi -feudal country, this process primarily benefits the imperialist powers and monopolies, which, through billions of capital investments, become the clock of this process and also attract the main profits. In India itself, this process has led to an enormous economic crisis, from which the Indian state tries to save itself against the people with the reinforcement of the Hindu -fascist forces led by Prime Minister Modi, even harder economic measures and other genocidal campaigns.

The blind hatred of the Hindu-fascist Indian state for the revolutionary and communist forces is based on a real "danger": that the India of caste, genocide, genocide, low-wage country and experimental laboratory could be transformed by a revolution into a new independent and people-democratic India. A perspective that gives large parts of the population the strength and hope to continue even more persistently the daily struggle against genocidal measures, land expulsions and repression, as organized and supported by FACAM.

 We denounce the judicial prosecution against ELME Chania in order for the strike - a ride that has declared an evaluation illegal. Prosecution that is integrated into its political criminalization of strikes in order to pass the evaluation to the public school. That is, to implement the policy that strikes the right to free education and promotes a more class of school for few and "chosen", with teachers of pupils, without rights. It is a continuation of the government -prosecution pogrom, state violence and repression against the struggles of teachers, students, workers, in progress.
 <br>
<br>
 They impose a climate of fascism, criminalize trade union action aimed at terrorizing, silencing any voice of resistance, but mainly target workers and all the people to bend their heads and accept the policy of poverty, poverty and participation in the country. Wars of imperialists as "regularity".
 <br>
<br>
 The government and the parties of the system that support its policy will not stop unless we stop them with our mass struggles. We need to unfold struggles against the barbaric policy that impoverishes us, but also against persecution and state violence and repression. Let the persecution and the climate of terror not pass. With our joint concerted struggles we can put the brakes on those who deprive us of our rights to life and mortgage our lives for the interests of the ruling class and its imperialist protectors.

   March 26, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  A unit of the New People’s Army (NPA) in Agusan del Sur province recently reported a harassment operation against 3rd Special Forces Battalion (3rd SFB) operating troops in Barangay Mabuhay, Prosperidad on January 19, 2024. Two fascists were killed in the attack, including a mercenary officer. The NPA unit was able to withdraw safely.
 </p>
<p>
  “The armed action is a response to the relentless focused military operation that covers the mountains bordering Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur,” according to the NPA-Agusan del Sur. It said military operations have disrupted the livelihood of the indigenous people and peasant masses since 2022.
 </p>
<p>
  Clusters of communities are militarized to allow the entry of illegal logging of large trees such as Magkuno, Lawaan, Yakal and others. The operations are supervised by retired officer Captain Aranas of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the 3rd SFB.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, AFP focused military operations serve to protect large mines in the Caraga region (which includes Agusan del Sur province and Surigao del Sur province). The region contains two gold mines, one chromite mine, 18 nickel, one hydrometallurgical processing plant, and one gold processing plant. All mines are geared for export.

<strong>
    Comrade Lenin, leading light of the international proletariat and great teacher of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism illuminates the path of unity for the international communist movement
   </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   "We are the ones who form the army of the great proletarian strategist, the army of Comrade Lenin. There is nothing higher than the honor of belonging to his army."
  </strong>
  (Stalin)
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
<strong>
     Lenin as the teacher of communism who broke the ice and prepared the path against international reaction and revisionism
    </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
   To correctly recognize the contradictions in the history of the class struggle, to understand the moments of historical rupture and to be ready in these moments of rupture, was the most outstanding feature of Comrade Lenin's entire struggle to his immortality. After the deaths of Marx and Engels, the leadership of the international proletariat was taken over for a long time by the opportunism of the Second International, and in the words of Comrade Stalin:
   <strong>
    “A period in which the parties of the second international were unable to take over the theoretical struggle to liberate the international proletariat and the peoples of the world from the influence of these opportunistic and class-compromising social democrats. In addition, with the foundations of the communist international, he developed a form of organization and struggle, functional, on the dynamics of the class struggle in the new period of capitalism, with the foundations of the communist international. ""
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Comrade Lenin transformed the Communist Party and the Communist International into an instrument of war against the bourgeoisie by freed the communist party and the movement of the communist international from the bonds of the legal forms of struggle:
   <strong>
    "Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was limp philistinism and shabby political haggling, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary intrigue. Of course, in order to keep up appearances, "revolutionary" resolutions and slogans were adopted..."
   </strong>
   But what "was kept in the official drawers" freed from the clasping of legal forms of combat.
   <strong strong="">
    (Stalin, basics of Leninism)
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Comrade Lenin, caught with his genius, realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off the burdens that are on the back of the international proletariat without fighting revisionism and opportunism without fighting Masses to show the true character of these views in theory and practice without isolating them as far as possible. With the establishment of the dialectical and necessary connection between the "inner struggle" and the "external struggle", he led the double fight.
  </p>
<p>
   Comrade Lenin left us the extremely necessary lesson that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of the prevailing reaction. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must clean revisionism and opportunism.
  </p>
<p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">
<strong>
     Hold Lenin's lessons within the tightened contradictions of the imperialist system
    </strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
   The imperialist system, which Lenin analyzed in detail at the beginning of the 20th century, has survived in past periods, but the contradictions are intensifying and they are in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Even if the dissolution of the USSR and the process of integration into the capitalist system that China went through prevented the contradictions from exploding for a while, the law of the uneven development of capitalism continues and the inter-imperialist rivalry develops into the stage of "disintegration" with regional wars. This shows the crisis in which the system finds itself and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who have maintained their crisis for a long time by shifting the burdens of the system to the semi-colonies and deepening the plundering of the semi-colonies, have also reached an impasse here.
  </p>
<p>
   One of the explosive points of the inherent problems of the imperialist system, which is developed in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism, that the interimperialist struggle, which has been managed in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought in regional wars. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the inter-imperialist contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.
  </p>
<p>
   We can see that developments with comrades in Lenin agree on the character of the character and the contradictions of imperialism:
   <strong>
    “The second contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for sources of raw materials, about foreign territories. Imperialism is capital export according to the raw material sources, angry struggle for the monopoly ownership of this
   </strong>
<strong>
    Sources of raw materials, struggle for the redistribution of the already divided world, a struggle that is led against the old groups and powers with particular fabricity from the new financial groups and powers who are looking for "a place in the sun", which capture the conquered tough . This angry struggle between the different groups of capitalists is important because it as an inevitable element of imperialist wars indicates wars to conquer foreign areas. This fact is important in turn because it means that the imperialists weaken each other, that the position of capitalism is weakened at all, that the moment of the proletarian revolution is closer and that this revolution becomes a practical need. "
   </strong>
   (Stalin, Fundamentals of Leninism)
  </p>
<p>
   The former socialist countries of Russia and China, which gave the imperialist system with their new markets, became the main players in inter-imperialist rivalry, in the competition with hegemonic power. This means that the scope and nature of contradictions with the growing participation of new and powerful players have increased in the fight for redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with the invasion of Russian imperialism in Ukraine took place under this background. It is foreseeable that this tendency will deepen and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, the places where the wars for the division take place will be the half -colonies and colonies. The half -colonies and the oppressed peoples will continue to pay the price for these wars until the imperialists explain the direct war.
  </p>
<p>
   The division of the world is deepened into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries - masterfully analyzed by Lenin - even more. The third contradictions intensify with the imperialist brand hooking and looting and the semi-feudal and feudal increase in powerful wars of national liberation and popular wars that shake the imperialist system.

      Lenin's Great Legacy, the Leninist Concept of the Party: The General Staff of the Proletariat
     </span>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
     "A revolution is not a banquet, not writing essays, not painting pictures or embroidering doilies; It cannot be carried out so delicately, so leisurely and delicately, so moderately, civilly, courteously, reservedly and generously. The revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another class."
    </strong>
    (Mao Zedong)
   </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
<strong>
       "Some people refer to us as a follower of" theory of the omnipotence of war "; Yes, we are supporters of the theory of the omnipotence of the revolutionary war, and that is not bad, but good, that's Marxist. The rifles of the Communist Party of Russia have created socialism. We want to create a democratic republic. The experiences of the class struggle in the age of imperialism teach us: The working class and the other working masses can only defeat the armed bourgeois and landlords with the power of the rifles; With this in mind, we can say that the whole world can only be redesigned with the help of the rifles. ”
      </strong>
      (Mao Zedong)
     </p>
<p>
      At its founding conference, the IKB defined the structure and reconstitution of communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party, which was developed by Comrade Mao, agrees with the understanding of the Communist Party, prescribed by Comrade Lenin and also enriched by Stalin and it is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party in the ideology of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism . In the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions in which we have to find ourselves, the communist party, which is able to resist the growing aggression of the imperialist reaction and to lead the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world to liberate, the qualities of a "combat organization of the Proletariats ”.
     </p>
<p>
      An essential legacy of Lenin is the question of power as the fundamental question of any revolution. Lenin showed how
      <strong>
       "The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without its exchange by a new one."
      </strong>
      and how
      <strong>
       "Everything is deception except power."
      </strong>
      Under Lenin's personal leadership, the world's first socialist state, the dictatorship of the proletariat, was created, concretizing the proletarian path to power and the maintenance of it.
     </p>
<p>
      After Lenin's death, it was his successor, Stalin, who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it further and made it the basis of the entire International Communist Movement. Based on the shoulders of the great Lenin, Chairman Mao was able to advance the world proletarian revolution to greater heights and develop the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism, which today is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, must be taken up, defended and applied today.
     </p>
<p>
      As an IKB, we will continue to fulfill the tasks set by the large Lenin and the legacy that the comrade Lenin left us well.
     </p>
<p>
      Comrade Lenin, the great teacher of the proletariat and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, leads and leads our struggle for the proletarian world revolution, as he did yesterday!
     </p>
<p>
<strong>
       Long live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!
      </strong>
<br>
<strong>
       Long live proletarian internationalism!

 Ferrini - of what happened during the same day in some 
 Italian squares affected by parades for Palestine; The Pennivendolo - 
  which evidently is permanently equipped with paralters - 
 argues that during the Rome event they heard "insults 
 to the life senator Liliana Segre, to David Parenzo and to the government from 
 part of the left and pro-Palestinian militants during the procession 
 Pro Palestine ».

  To demonstrate what he asserts transcribes some passages of the 
 Interventions at the parade: “We have further proof of the immortal 
 Victimism by our dear life senator Liliana Segre - 
 He marked one of the participants - who treats the word to the megaphone 
 genocide as if it were an exclusivity of a few. Blind in front of the 
 Palestinian doctors in Gaza treated by slaughter beasts. Denuded e 
 Trucidati ". Insults also to the journalist

  , defined one of the "cornerstones of Zionism Made in Italy".
 </p>
<p>
  We ask, to anyone who is not permanently equipped with 
 blinders, to explain to us - after analyzing without preconceptions how much 
 just repeated - what the insults would be addressed to the nonagenaria 
 Milanese senator; We cannot see any: unless not than 
 we mean the accusations of not wanting to see another holocaust if not 
 that immediately from the Jews but not only from them, in the period of 
 Second World War by the Hitler's hordes with the help of 
 Mussolinian fascists, collaborators and spies ready to denounce the 
 Reprobes for some personal gain.

  In the long history 
 of the struggle of our popular democratic movement, on March 23 has a 
 particular revolutionary value in the hearts of all of them 
 beat for a right society and at the same time despise 
 resolutely imperialism. On March 23, the companions Bhagat Singh, 
 Sukdev and Rajguru have been hanged by the British colonial power 
 To crush the anti-colonial liberation movement of the time. 
 The victory of the Bolshevik revolution had influenced these three 
 Indian revolutionaries who formed HSRA (Association 
 Socialist revolutionary of Hindustan). Comrade Baghat Singh 
 he played a fundamental role in the formation of HSRA, and stated 
 clearly that who the color is the dominant classes, that 
 be of white, black or other skin, the struggle must be continued 
 against all exploiters.

  Those same
exploiters colluding with the imperialists are now celebrating their
martyrdom, and in particular the leadership of the RSS, which
He strongly opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. The BJP, organ
of the RSS, today it claims all the freedom fighters,
including fellow Bhagat Singh and his followers, They have no rights
Nor is it moral to talk about freedom fighters and
distort their movement. Our Party, CPI (Maoist), makes
his revolutionary homage to them and fights for the realization of the
of their revolutionary aspirations.

      In our
	long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a
	specific revolutionary place in the history of class struggle for
	all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at
	the same time that despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March,
	Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by
	the
      <br>
      British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing
	anti-colonial freedom movement.

<p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
       After the
	formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country,
	and the Indian ruling classes: comprador big bourgeois and big
	landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any
	hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes
	after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
	native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the
	owners of the significant number of means of production of the
	country implemented distorted development industrial policy that
	benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial
	policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population
	of India.
      </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
       With the entry of
	finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast
	scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people
	happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India
	continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than
	before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
	Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and
	Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk
	for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian
	resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All
	parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their
	party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has
	broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable
	misery to the toiling masses.
      </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
        Development
	in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed
	people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for
	cheap natural resources that are available in the third world
	countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that
	mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To
	plunder the
        <br/>
        resources of India, Imperialism has backed every
	fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
	India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the
	Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried
	out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,
	Sendera, Operation Green-
        <br/>
        Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it
	has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of
	indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global
	finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden
	state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to
	fascist political system in India. Massive
        <br/>
        deployments of
	military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the
	plunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's
	resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,
	lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state
	under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry
	horrific
        <br/>
        news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It
	is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop
	until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is
	uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on
	the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in
	Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
        <br/>
        developed more
	brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the
	struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central
	and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting
	against this enemy's machines and methods.

	of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human
	rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with
	revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct

  In the long history 
 of the struggle of our popular democratic movement, on March 23 has a 
 particular revolutionary value in the hearts of all of them 
 beat for a right society and at the same time despise 
 resolutely imperialism. On March 23, the companions Bhagat Singh, 
 Sukdev and Rajguru have been hanged by the British colonial power 
 To crush the anti-colonial liberation movement of the time. 
 The victory of the Bolshevik revolution had influenced these three 
 Indian revolutionaries who formed HSRA (Association 
 Socialist revolutionary of Hindustan). Comrade Baghat Singh 
 he played a fundamental role in the formation of HSRA, and stated 
 clearly that who the color is the dominant classes, that 
 be of white, black or other skin, the struggle must be continued 
 against all exploiters.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Those same
exploiters colluding with the imperialists are now celebrating their
martyrdom, and in particular the leadership of the RSS, which
He strongly opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. The BJP, organ
of the RSS, today it claims all the freedom fighters,
including fellow Bhagat Singh and his followers, They have no rights
Nor is it moral to talk about freedom fighters and
distort their movement. Our Party, CPI (Maoist), makes
his revolutionary homage to them and fights for the realization of the
of their revolutionary aspirations.

      Let us
	continue our struggle to fulfill the dreams of all great martyrs of
	freedom movement and let us fight for a New Democratic India.
     </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<br/>
      In our
	long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a
	specific revolutionary place in the history of class struggle for
	all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at
	the same time that despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March,
	Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by
	the
      <br/>
      British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing
	anti-colonial freedom movement.
     </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<br/>
       After the
	formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country,
	and the Indian ruling classes: comprador big bourgeois and big
	landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any
	hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes
	after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
	native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the
	owners of the significant number of means of production of the
	country implemented distorted development industrial policy that
	benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial
	policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population
	of India.
      </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
       With the entry of
	finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast
	scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people
	happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India
	continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than
	before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
	Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and
	Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk
	for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian
	resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All
	parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their
	party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has
	broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable
	misery to the toiling masses.
      </p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<br/>
         Development
	in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed
	people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for
	cheap natural resources that are available in the third world
	countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that
	mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To
	plunder the
         <br>
         resources of India, Imperialism has backed every
	fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
	India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the
	Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried
	out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,
	Sendera, Operation Green-
         <br/>
         Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it
	has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of
	indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global
	finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden
	state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to
	fascist political system in India. Massive
         <br/>
         deployments of
	military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the
	plunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's
	resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,
	lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state
	under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry
	horrific
         <br/>
         news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It
	is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop
	until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is
	uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on
	the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in
	Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
         <br/>
         developed more
	brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the
	struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central
	and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting
	against this enemy's machines and methods.
        </br>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
        Central Committee
	of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working-
	class, peasantry, dalits, and women's organizations, well- wishers
	of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human
	rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with
	revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
	seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat
	Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design
	of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

	anti-colonial freedom movement.

          After the
	formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country,
	and the Indian ruling classes: comprador big bourgeois and big
	landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any
	hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes
	after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
	native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the
	owners of the significant number of means of production of the
	country implemented distorted development industrial policy that
	benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial
	policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population
	of India.
         </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
          With the entry of
	finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast
	scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people
	happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India
	continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than
	before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
	Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and
	Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk
	for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian
	resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All
	parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their
	party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has
	broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable
	misery to the toiling masses.

            Development
	in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed
	people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for
	cheap natural resources that are available in the third world
	countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that
	mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To
	plunder the
            <br>
            resources of India, Imperialism has backed every
	fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
	India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the
	Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried
	out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,
	Sendera, Operation Green-
            <br/>
            Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it
	has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of
	indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global
	finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden
	state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to
	fascist political system in India. Massive
            <br/>
            deployments of
	military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the
	plunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's
	resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,
	lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state
	under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry
	horrific
            <br/>
            news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It
	is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop
	until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is
	uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on
	the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in
	Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
            <br/>
            developed more
	brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the
	struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central
	and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting
	against this enemy's machines and methods.

           Central Committee
	of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working-
	class, peasantry, dalits, and women's organizations, well- wishers
	of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human
	rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with
	revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
	seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat
	Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design
	of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

  In particular, the police stopped and threatened to detain students who went to hang banners against the establishment of private universities.
 </p>
<p>
  Once again the system's attempt to terrorize students and get rid of their struggles is clear again. We see it both with the provocative presence of the Police in the demonstrations and hitting the occupations, as well as with the unnecessary tramping on the streets.
 </p>
<p>
  We will not let them sow the terror! Through assemblies, occupations and demonstrations we will continue the fight against Pierrakakis law and the policy that strikes the popular right to education.

   What is happening to the steel mills of Italy.
  </b>
<br>
<br>
  ...The 
  new decree that the government has made with the aim of satisfying the 
 small and medium masters of the contract that advance large credits from 
 Steel mills of Italy and at the same time ... extending the cashier 
 integration to all workers of the contract (also for whom, and are 
 many, has the CCNL Multiservizi) ... is unable to resolve the 
 problems of the future of workers.
  <br>
  Moreover, workers do not 
 They want to be put in layoffs and then, if you resume 
 Steelworks would return to work (when and how everything is to be seen). 
  The workers want to work immediately! Without the resumption of work 
 There will be layoffs and redundancies.
  <br/>
<br/>
<b>
   The government has decided the extraordinary administration with the support of confederal and USB trade union organizations.
  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
  Also 
  The unions, as in the beginning the Segr, Naz. Palombella della Uilm, who 
 They said no to the AS, today they are all satisfied, because it was sent 
 away from the Mittal government and the notorious in Morselli. In fact confirming 
  Among the workers, the idea, already very propagated, that if he govern e 
 Management changed the problems of this factory are solved. It's a 
  Deep illusion. As if it is a manager who decides politics and not the 
  owners of the company as a whole, not the laws of capital, the 
 World Economic Crisis, the laws of governments, etc ...
  <br/>
  Now, it's good 
 know that the periods in which this company was of the state (since 1963 
  to 1995) they are much greater than the periods in which it was private individuals; 
 Then the crisis of the Riva Group, the "Educational Environment" investigation of 2012 
 He meant that this company, formally commissioned, was 
 managed by the State and its governments from 2012 to 2018; and, in all 
 These years have not been seen any kind of improvement or on the plane 
 of health and safety - actually key theme for this 
 factory - nor compared to the ordinary trend in terms of 
 exploitation, working conditions, rights, wages, use 
 Flexible for layoffs. Everything went the same ...
  <br/>
<br/>
<b>
   We consider the extraordinary administration a worse remedy for evil.
  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
  Will bring 
  more permanent layoffs; There will be no return to the work of 
 workers of many companies
  <span>

<a name="more">
</a>
 of the contract, and in some there will be layoffs 
  in the next future; Thousands of 
 Esuber, beyond the post -extraordinary administration solutions of the 
 Government, you will worsen the wage conditions/ 
 working/ contractual; and by environmentalization, reclamation, 
 Decarbonization, well that goes, years and years will pass ...
 <br/>
<br/>
 There 
 factory today has as its main commissioner, Giancarlo Quaranta, who in 
  these years has been part of the previous management, of the period of 
 Riva, which was definitively sentenced for death in 2003 a 
 followed collapse of the arm of a crane of 2 workers (Paolo Franco e 
 Pasquale Ettorre), a very felt mortal accident that gave birth to the 
 Committee 12 June and to the network for safety; and another worker 
 In 2002, Marco Perrone in work training - first fatal accidents 
 of a new generation of workers ... on the great question of 
 environmental disaster caused by the factory is forty that in his 
 guise of director had said on the path paths - that nailed 
 The Ilva at his serious, enormous, responsibility for the emissions they have 
 Product pollution and death in the city and in the neighborhoods - that there is "a 
  Great question in the relationship between cause and effect ".
 <br/>
 Forty 
 has held several positions even after the seizure of the plants 
 of 2012, was promoted as central director of the operations of 
 Steel mills, a charge that he held for about a year. But then not 
 disappears, goes to the operational technical division, participates in all 
 subsequent events also as Commissioner Dell’Alva in AS, after 
 Mittal's entry.
 <br/>
 So we have a thousand and a reason to say 
 that, both the choice of the extraordinary administration and the appointment of 
 this commissioner,
 <b>
  they represent not a change but a restoration. A restoration of Ilva at its worst.
 </b>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Then
 The government says the factory will be handed over to new owners, who will 
they will use the same logic as Mittal: do the maximum 
profit, cutting jobs and costs, first and foremost those exorbitant on 
effective safety and protection of health, and in all this to have 
hands-free...
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   ... who would be the new masters.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  The world steel market has been in crisis of overproduction for a long time 
  time; a relative overproduction in the capitalist system because the 
 sale of the steel must carry out the profits for the masters, certainly not 
  because the need for steel does not grow in the world with many countries that 
  they need accelerated industrial development in which steel 
 plays a decisive role.
  <br/>
  And that's how, if you think Mittal, 
 As soon as he slowed down his commitment on Taranto he immediately 
 expanded in his country, in India, where there will be the largest 
 The world steel that will accompany the regime's rise dynamics 
 Indian.
  <br/>
  This crisis of the Taranto plant plays a 
 important function ... it 
 Taranto plant is strategically placed in a key point 
 towards the new markets that in perspective open in North Africa, in 
 Middle East. Possessing Taranto means having a ring 
 fundamental of the world chain of steel production.
  <br/>
  There 
  truth is that
  <b>
   The masters, in a phase like this, the plants there 
 they want "free",
  </b>
  that they are delivered to him at four money and in which 
 they can
  <b>
   have a free hand
  </b>
  in the type of production, in 
 exploitation of work-work, environmental issues and 
 judicial. However, this is the condition required today by all 
 Steel manufacturers in Italy, Europe, in the world.
  <br/>
<br/>
  So, who 
  They would be the new investors. From the news it is known that one can be 
 there
  <b>
   Vulcan Green steel.
  </b>
  A multinational that is building a system 
  from 5 million tons of pre -labor and, as you know, the pre -launch is 
  one of the prospects for environmentalization, for the transformation 
 production of the Ilva of Taranto. The investment in Oman is two 
 billions of dollars. He is now looking for a steel mill to produce 
 steel. The owner is Naveen Jindal son of the Jindal. In Italy 
 Jindal was the rival of ArceloMittal to acquire Ilva, he lost 
  The race and poured on Piombino, doing damage.
  <br/>
  So 
 Vulcangreensteel is a 'by -product' by Jindal ...
  <br/>
  The Indians of this 
  group would like ILVA, but by putting maximum one and a half billion 
 of resources e
  <b>
   they think of a reduced Ilva with 5,000 employees in all,
  </b>
  then with a halving of the current working class of the 
 establishment and equally of the contract.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The other competitor, 
 This is very sponsored also for its national character from 
 Meloni government, but also by the Federacciai and on a substantial part 
 of the union, is
  <b>
   Arvedi ...
  </b>
<br/>
  There 
  position of Arvedi has always been of willingness to intervene in 
 combination with the public partner, that is to say if the money puts the 
 Public shareholder and as long as there is Tabula Rasa compared to the previous. 
 That is, the same things that Arcelormittal asked. Moreover, his plan 
  It would only focus on electrosiderurgia, in Taranto yes 
 should build a new laminated and three electric ovens but this 
 It means that when it is fully operational in several years,
  <b>
   5,000 workers are enough,
  </b>
  Not how many are today in Taranto, with the consequent net 
 reduction of the survey ...
  <br/>
  Finally we come to the
  <b>
   group 
  Ukrainian metinvest
  </b>
  who is advancing as an interlocutor. Metinvest sees 
 Especially in Cornigliano the first interesting business. Metinvest is 
 owned by Ukrainian Oligorca Rinat Akhmetov. Ukraine, since times 
 not suspicious, well before the war broke out, is dominated by 
 an industrial-financial oligarchy, of the same nature as that 
 Russian, although on a smaller scale. The personal heritage of 
 Akhmetov is 5.7 billion dollars, with two centers of interest, the 
 Finance and steelmate. It appears on the list of the 500 richest men 
 of the world and has two purposes: the money and the need to acquire skills 
 Product.
  <br/>
  "The special operation" by Vladimir Putin has done 
 of his main steel tank in Ukraine, Azovstal of Mariupol, one 
 Zombiestan,
  <br/>
  Akhmetov noted Piombino. The Meloni government has 
 Taranto proposed to Akhmetov and there would be a liking of 
 Americans ... as Il Sole 24 Ore always says 'it is buying capacity' 
 productive 
  All over the world ', what he had done and continues to do Mittal. 
 Meetinvest, however - always according to this press - does not want to enter 
 Conflict with ArceloMittal, because it is clear that with the Ilva in the hands of 
 Others will be war among the steel multinationals. But the effects 
 Also this time they will be downloaded on the workers ...
  <br/>
<br/>
<b>
   ... the main problem is to affirm workers' autonomy.
  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
  Affirm
 that the workers' struggle is autonomous in its objectives, in its forms of 
Struggle and organization. It is not in favor of a master rather than a 
other; its watchword must be: masters of state, masters of the 
the very exploitation of the proletariat. We think that only the 
Prolonged and general autonomous and unitary struggle of the workers Steelworks/
 contract/workers cigs in Ilva AS must and can defend the interests of
 working class on work, wages, working conditions, rights and
 safety; and that, therefore, another line and another line is needed 
union leadership to be built in the fire of struggle, and to be part of the 
of the strategic battle against this government and any government of the 
bosses, the state of capital and the system 
capitalist/imperialist, for a workers' government, a new state and 
A new power in the hands of the proletarians and popular masses.
  <br/>
  This is 
 important for organizing your self -defense initially, for 
 build in the struggle the strength necessary to overthrow the "table" of 
 This factory ...
 </p>
<p>
  From the point of view of the workers of the Steel Mill and the Contract
  <b>
   In all these months of meetings in Rome, no workers' platform has been put on the table, no concrete demands
  </b>
  in defense of the workers: from the minimum, of the wage integration to the 
  Cassintegration (millions to the masters and not even hundreds of euros to 
 workers); at the resumption of work both in the contract and for all in 
 Steel mill; from the blocking of layoffs; to use in reclamation 
 industrial area of workers for more than 5 years in CIG in AS; to the 
 Single metalworking contract and permanent for everyone 
 in the contract; For 25 years they have been enough to retire, on returning to the 
 Work/asbestos law; to the reduction of working hours a 
 equality of payroll pay. Instead, from not having the blocking of 
 layoffs and redundancies have gone to no longer even have 
 word to treat the layoffs, to contain it, 
 regularize it against the repeated requests that came from Adi for 
  reasons for flexibility in factory management ...
  <br/>
<br/>
  ... it will be 
  Once again to the workers to choose which side to be on: on the part of the 
  government, of future new masters who look a lot like the old people who, who 
 On the general level they will present "copy" plans to those of 
 ArceloMectal, on the side of confederal unions that have become a ring 
 of the collaborative and neocorporative structure that identifies in the 
 solutions for the masters the solution for workers, when the whole 
 history of this factory shows that this is the cause of 
 what happened; or the workers choose the reorganization of 
 File workers, starting from their class interests, from a vision 
 opposite on the future of the plant, which is then the future of the class 
 worker, first of all as a historical subject who may be the element 
 transformation of units between workers and popular masses in this 
 factory and not only in this factory, but in general ...
  <br/>
<br/>
  ...There 
 Ex Ilva issue must remain the center of the attention of the workers, 
 of workers. And certainly not only in Taranto, even if in Taranto yes 
 He fights the main battle on the matter ...
  <br/>
  ... when the government, i 
  masters, they say that Ilva is strategic, we are completely 
 agree with the government. The only question is that "strategic" for us has 
 another value: it has an important value for the working class of 
 our country, for the proletariat; and everything that imports for the 
 working class and for the proletariat of our country, it imports 
 in the class struggle, in the conflict between masters and workers, in 
 conflict between government and workers, in the conflict between capital state 
  and workers, in the conflict between the way of production 
 capitalist/imperialistic and workers ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... today as never before 
  Workers' autonomy is the only solution, the reconstruction of the strength 
 of workers as a strength against, not strength for, against the logic of 
 masters, government and unions that go in the direction of deepening the 
 Crisis, do not solve the problems of workers and popular masses ...
  <br/>
<br/>
  ...In 
  All this the Slai Cobas for the class union represents 
 the only alternative item and on this will be important, both at the level of 
 factories and cities both nationally and this alternative item 
 feel strong and clear and find all the necessary understanding from 
 part of the class and combative trade union movement and of all 
 workers who are directly or indirectly involved in 
  this story ....

<p>
  The largest terrorist attack in recent years occurred on March 22
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  , 2024 at about 20:00 Moscow time in the city of Krasnogorsk, Moscow Region. Four terrorists opened fire on visitors to the Crocus City Hall shopping center, killing at least 137 people (including three children) and injuring more than 154 people. As a result of further arson and explosions, the concert hall building was destroyed. We deeply sympathize with all those who suffered and lost their loved ones as a result of this merciless act of terror against civilians. We are also against speculation, which the media immediately launched, using the tragedy to their advantage. This applies to both official media and various kinds of reactionary fascist channels and resources.
 </p>
<p>
  A branch of ISIS (a terrorist organization banned on the territory of the Russian Federation) took responsibility for the terrorist attack. All the circumstances of the preparation for the terrorist attack and the persons associated with it are being clarified, but according to the information available at the moment, it is this group that is responsible for the preparation and execution of the act of terror. The authorities received warnings from the intelligence services of Western countries (USA) about a possible terrorist attack by this terrorist group, the goals of which could include large public events.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite this, official and unofficial media immediately began to promote the version of Ukraine’s direct involvement in organizing the terrorist attack. This is extremely beneficial for the country’s political elite, because it will allow them to use the fear and hatred that has arisen to promote even stricter laws that restrict any freedoms of citizens, up to the complete elimination of any open opposition in the country. Also, the “Ukrainian trace” can easily be used as a pretext for escalating the war in Ukraine and for attracting and mobilizing new combatants to the front. Various telegram channels close to security forces and military structures in the first hours began to call for retaliatory strikes on Ukrainian cities, although there was still no information about the organizers of the terrorist attack or evidence demonstrating Ukraine’s involvement in the terrorist attack.
 </p>
<p>
  The political consequence of this terrorist attack may also be that the hands of various fascist groups on Russian territory will be freed. After the terrorist attack, accusations of all migrants, Muslims, and citizens of the Caucasus of being prone to terrorism and a danger to the “Russian State” began to spread in right-wing telegram channels. Official media are trying to the last to promote the version of the “Ukrainian trace,” often putting forward conspiracy theories about what happened. Here’s a quote from the NTV channel:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   Having called the terrorist attack horrible, the White House representative above of all began to justify the Kiev regime and his own embassy. John Kirby said that he was ready to remove speculation about the connection between the events and Ukraine. And when asked whether the United States knew about the attack in advance, Kirby said that needs to be asked from the State Department.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   The Kyiv proxies of the United States, as soon as the reports about the first victims of terrorists came, as usual, tried to make a triumph out of the tragedy on the Internet. But very soon this rhetoric was replaced: Ukrainian media began to report that the security agencies began to deny their involvement. And Western media put forward a version that the Islamic State terrorist group banned in Russia is behind everything. All night long, respected publications published fakes and speculation… The headlines were like a carbon copy, until telegram channels began to print stuff, the source of which is difficult to track, that the perpetrators of the terrorist attack could be natives of one of the Russian republics. This is already a well-known handwriting of the Ukrainian special services and their information centers.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Zyuganov also expressed his speculations about what happened:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   Please note that the action has not yet ended, and the Americans were the first to shed crocodile tears and set everyone off on the wrong trail, that this is supposedly ISIS, but this is not ISIS, and beards can be glued on, and whatever, that is nonsense, this the work of those who are in prison, they are planning these actions, those who are entrenched in Ukraine, those who are trying to form traitors, all sorts of scoundrels, and so on. All this is well known.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  From all this it is clear that the ruling class will use this tragedy for its own purposes in order to further limit the freedoms of citizens and introduce new laws prohibiting any, even the most formal, forms of protest. They want to use the tragedy and pain of people to pit people against each other, to continue the “Special military operation” and impose an increasingly chauvinistic nationalist order in the country. We must always remember that the ruling class uses any tragedy of the people to its advantage in order to further exploit the people. Under the words about cohesion and unity, they talk about the cohesion of “slaves and masters.” This serves only the interests of the oligarchs, but not the working people of our country – the real victims of this terrorist attack, who should receive condolences from the leaders of other countries, and not Putin.

  four armed men carried out an attack with assault rifles and incendiary devices in Krasnogorsk, Moscow’s metropolitan area, in the concert hall Crocus City Hall, where a concert was being held, where thousands of people had gathered. According to Yankee imperialism, they were informed about this possible attack and they shared the information with Russian authorities, making a warning from the Yankee embassy in Russia. Afterwards, the news agency of the Islamic State (ISIS), Aamaq (
  <em>

    regarding the ISIS actions against Russian imperialism,
   </a>
   in 2017 there were reports which pointed out the recruitment of more combatants from the former Soviet republics in Central Asia, and additionally, in 2015 pointed out that many Caucasus militants gave their pledge to the ISIS and formed the ISIS-Caucasus. In 2022 they made an attack against the Russian embassy in Kabul. At the same time,

    This attack on Russian territory is the deadliest
   </a>
   since the Caucasus militants took the Beslan’s school, in North Ossetia in 2004. In this attack more than 300 people were killed. Also it is the deadliest attack in Moscow since the apartment bombings in 1999, which ended with the loss of life of almost 300 people. Both cases were responses to the Russian imperialism’s repressive police and the atrocities committed by it against the Caucasus’ peoples. There, Chechnya became a combatant territory against the Russian State.

    The list of crimes of Soviet social-imperialism
   </a>
   and Russian imperialism in Central Asia is very long: the invasion of Afghanistan was one of the biggest crimes they made in a long time, with a military occupation and the repression against the Afghan people, which last for almost a decade. Afterwards the involvement in the Tajikistan’s civil war between 1992 and 1997 was another of the Russian imperialist interventions in the region, and thus, the maintenance of the control of the Russian imperialism in the region, being Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan two of the more oppressed countries by Russian imperialism in the area. Another country which suffered the Russian iron fist was Kazakhstan, which after the strong protests in 2022, saw a Russian military intervention in the same year in order to maintain the status quo. All of this, along with the wars in Chechnya
   <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russias-muslim-strategy-foreign-policy/">
    were crimes which were seen by the Muslim population as attacks
   </a>
   against its identity, and therefore brought Russian imperialism to be seen as an specially reactionary element against its peoples. Additionally the Muslim population in Moscow, coming from oppressed nations and peoples, has denounced increasing attacks and Islamophobia since its migration to the Russian capital skyrocketed since the 90’s.
  </p>
<p>
   The crimes from Russian imperialism has been relevant in many other places against Muslim population, as
   <a href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/time-its-personal-russias-foreign-policymaking-middle-east">
    in the military interventions and support to local lackeys
   </a>
   in Africa and Middle East, in the wars of Libya, Syria, massacres committed and support to the local lackeys’ regimes in Mali, Niger, Center-African Republic, Sudan or Burkina Faso. Or event with the increasing collusion with some of the local ruling classes of Middle East, as with United Arab Emirates with which they collaborate in Sudan, as we
   <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/22/war-torn-sudan-heading-for-disaster/" title="">
    recently reported
   </a>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   This policy of aggressions and repression against the oppressed peoples and nations of the world – some of them, currently as in the Caucasus, under Russian direct military occupation -, shows how Russian imperialism is a big oppressor of the peoples from the world. Many of these peoples share the Islamic religion, some that has been used by organizations as ISIS-K and diverse insurgent groups, to lead the masses’ wrath against Russian imperialism. This also shows a historical reality of the imperialist interventions, and it is,
   <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/23/europe/moscow-concert-hall-attack-analysis-intl-cmd">
    when they bring war abroad, then the war comes back home
   </a>
   . The Soviet social-imperialism, and after it, Russian imperialism, brought war to the homes of Afghan people, and to the homes of the Caucasus, Africa, Middle East peoples… and after all of this came back in form of multiple armed actions in Russian territory and in form of insurgency in these territories. All of this points out that, despite that,
   <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/26/two-years-of-russian-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine/" title="">
    as we reported
   </a>
   , Russian imperialism is achieving to slowly advance in its main current challenge, which is the imperialist war of aggression against Ukraine, and it is still being a relevant actor in the international scenario, and that it is not almighty. The brutal repression in the internal level and the great military power have not been enough, showing once again that imperialism is a paper tiger when it oppresses and faces the peoples from the world.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Yesterday, March 25, there was the meeting 
 scheduled to the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy on the ex -dispute 
 Fiat Termini Imerese (ex blutec) over 12 long (with definitive closure long 
 wanted by Marchionne on December 31, 2011).
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
<span>
   As you know, after the failure of the former Blutec, they were made 
 Several calls for the relaunch of the industrial area, all of which have been emptied. Yesterday, 
 However, the extraordinary commissioners found in the Pelligra Holding group 
 Italy s.r.l. The "successful tenderer" of the last announcement. Ross Pelligra is 
 an Italian-Australian master, already known in Sicily for buying the 
 Catania Calcio. What does Pelligra Holding deal with? of constructions e 
 building renovations. What does it have to do with industrial production? Nothing!
  </span>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
<span>
   But this seemed to be a secondary fact to the ministry: in the
Pelligra should (when he finally takes possession of the area,
at the end of the procedure provided for in the call) "reclaim and equip the area
In order to allow the establishment of production activities in the area, some of the
which will be directly linked to port activity" (from Il Sole 24 Ore),
in short, to restore all the old buildings of the plant and make them a
"
  </span>
<b>
<span>
    new park 
 industrial
   </span>
</b>
<span>
   " ready, that is, in turn to be entrusted to other companies that
they should produce something...
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
<span>
   And who puts in the money? There is a "Program Agreement worth 105 million" and
then "
  </span>
<span>
   Available 
 There are also 70 million euros allocated by the last government financial 
 Musumeci ... ", in short, the Sicily Region which in addition, through the Department of 
 Work, for "passive and active policies" has 30 million available!
  </span>
<span>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
<span>
   Clearly, this project has been peppered with big words about construction
of the Termini Imerese Freight Village "which will make it possible to combine different ways of
transport (road, rail, sea) and be the centre of gravity of a large area of
production (which) will make the area active and attractive again for new
productive investments."
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
<span>
   And the workers? This building renovation project provides for “hiring 
 of 350 employees, currently in layoffs, with guarantee of employment 
 for the next 24 months. "
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>
   350 are
  </span>
  556 for two years! And then?
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
  They could also return to the “Company 
 of purpose ”and be ... accompanied to retirement.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<o:p>
</o:p>
<p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  While “for the 180 workers who 
 they would remain outside the perimeter of the hires (another 40 can retire 
 immediately) the hypotheses are different: the first concerns the recognition of the work 
 used and on this Minister Calderone would have shown availability to 
 go into detail; The second includes a period of another two years of Naspi at 
 expire of the CIG and then be accompanied to retirement; The third provides 
 the establishment of a newly public purpose of the purpose that could 
 Absorbing workers still in charge of Blutec. "
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  This meeting “chaired by 
 Ministers Adolfo Urso and Marina Elvira Calderone ... with the Undersecretary to 
 Mimit, Fausta Bergamotto, the extraordinary commissioners of the Giuseppe company 
 Glorious, Fabrizio Grasso and Andrea Bucarelli, the Sicilian region, the Municipality 
 of Termini Imerese, the port system authority of the western Sicily sea of Sicily 
 and the representatives of the trade union organizations ”has served substantially 
 To find a way to definitively resolve the issue of workers 
 of the former Fiat, retiring them in one way or another! And of course it can 
 be considered a great commercial in view of the elections 
 European. And in fact also the current president of the Region wanted to say the 
 his greeting the "industrial plan".
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  And the confederal unions? They remember 
 that there are still 200 of the survey for which nothing has been decided and express, 
 As always, some "perplexities", given the "complexity" of the question, but in the 
 substance I agree, suffice the declaration of those of the Fiom-Cgil: “Project 
 of reindustrialisation, retirements and purposes are three elements 
 essential to give a solution to all workers ".
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  No, just no. The workers in 
 layoff for 12 years, seasoned with promises and no ending chatter 
 On the "next reindustrialisation" and loss of salary, they did not have 
 No "solution" if not the one to lose ...
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  However, since the steps 
 provided for the implementation of these agreements should be concluded 
 by 4 November next, the date of the definitive expiry of all 
 social safety nets, the workers have time to analyze and reason 
 on the proposal and make their decisions!

   The ferocious siege ad al shifa hospital is going 
 For a week now

  , with employment troops 
 unleashed inside the complex and snipers, accompanied by 
 military helicopters, who target anyone who tries to escape 
 from the place.
  <br>
  In total silence of western governments,
  <b>
   Israel 
 has transformed a hospital into an area of death and torture
  </b>
  where until a few hours ago it was impossible to know what it was 
 happening, above all because of the inability even for the 
 Red crescent, to reach the surrounded place.
  <br>
  Monday 18th 
 March, in fact, heavily armed Israeli forces have 
 Hospital attacked for the second time since October, but 
 paradoxically more fiercely, violent, sadistic and devoid of 
 scruples, shooting against thousands of patients, medical staff and 
 displaced civilians.

Let's go back to the image on what the LJR was throughout this year. Lyon, September 2023 Hello comrades, we think it is appropriate to start these lines by welcoming the hard work of all the members of the Revolutionary Youth League, without whom the LJR would not exist. You are the ardent heart of a small organization today, it is a fact, but which is constantly developing, consolidates its ranks and is thirsty for victory, justice, thirst for revolution, and nothing will stop it, We are convinced. We are proud of your confidence, responsibilities that you have given us, and we are inspired by your devotion to the proletariat to give more and more constantly improving our work. 1 <br/><br/> As you know, the year that has just passed was a valuable school for each of our sections, for each of our members and for our national office particularly. Imperialism is experiencing a widespread crisis, a crisis of decomposition which leads and develops with it a revolutionary wave. The time we repeat, is great because the era is in the revolution, the latter is the main trend in the world, the masses bubble to the four corners of the world and the bourgeoisie trembles on its rotten bases. The new world is only waiting for its vanguard, and the facts prove that we are at the time of the strategic offensive of the world proletarian revolution. This whole situation shows us more than ever than the need for the reconstruction of the Communist Party of France is more relevant than ever it is a burning, vital question. The hard work implemented in each section, added to the intensity of the class struggle in our country has enabled our organization to strengthen and develop. We have been intransigent on our working methods, reinforcing our functioning more and at the same time we have been ﬂ e exit, adapting directives and plans to the burning situation of our country, without ever losing sight of our strategic axes. We were, comrades, at the most bubbling moments of recent social movements, on the front line, starting to actively direct and at different levels of the parts of the revolutionary movement in France and the revolted masses. Our flag was 2 <br/><br/> High university blockade, processions against pension reform, blockages, our flag opened free tolls, founded and led to fight committees, summer at the front of the major June ups and above all, At the heart of our precious districts. More importantly, our flag was pointed out by the masses as flag of its vanguard, the flag of those who put themselves at the service of the large masses, at the service of the Revolution and the New World. Admittedly, these developments are quantitatively weak, but that proves to us that our style of work is fair and that nothing prevents us from being able to develop it on a very wide scale. In all our cities, our work develops and consolidates, in Toulouse for example, we have brought massive demonstrations in the heart of our proletarian districts, districts fleeing like the plague by opportunists, and where a CPES was created during This February, proving that we are constantly advancing firmly. We have served the people with all our hearts, particularly in Lyon, where our comrades have provided titanic work and where dozens of families can already say "it is the young people with the flags" who organize the struggle, who serve the masses, Who prepare the new power in the poorest district of the second metropolis of France. We are, comrades, who give all our strength, to end misery and exploitation, it is us, comrades, who will continue to hold these flags firmly! These advances we owe them to our hard work and our just working methods because dictated by our ideology. Our national office has 3 <br/><br/> Loan oath to serve the revolution to initiate its trigger as soon as possible, and to fill this oath, each member of the national office worked harshly, visited the sections, answering all questions and developing plans for each of our axes of work, setting up numerous directives in the fire of the class struggle, and continuing to control and exchange with the political leaders of the sections while Accentuating tactical decentralization to forge them in a fairer way, once the minimum base has been acquired. The National Office has set up long -term plans: the three "dear life" "youth" and "proletarian internationalism" plans. A control program was also carried out in 2023, as well as a recruitment brochure "why join the LJR". The base documents of the LJR in particular the call text will be updated. Many press releases have also been published, as well as several numbers from the League Bulletin, making it possible to carry the voice of the League on important subjects of the company and the class struggle. By sporting, defending and applying our very powerful because true ideology, we were able to move forward more and more to unity with our young revolutionary comrades, and we continue to move towards this precious unity. We are sure that 2024 will see great advancements occurring in this struggle for unity, because the class requires! This is a news that fills us with joy. We are also proud to announce that we are developing links with Strasbourg revolutionaries, which we will soon meet in order to found a new 4 <br/><br/> section. We must not release our efforts and redouble it on our breaches and limits. Each member of each section must notably read and study carefully the internal texts of the league, and we must watch firmly. As a youth organization we have to unite youth so that they can bind to the masses, study Marxism, apply the plans to the end, go beyond them, and apply combative practice. At the end of filling these necessities we must redouble their efforts to combat revisionists and opportunists and group the masses under our direction, particularly in the proletarian districts. We must break the walls of universities, by sporting, defending and applying, mainly applying, Marxism where it is the most attacked. Our organization is increasingly recognized, we have won respect for the militant environment, we have built a fair internal functioning and we have established ourselves in some proletarian districts and now increase our activity on the faculties. It is so much to act as the force that we are, we are unstoppable and we must act as such, the districts, the faculties, the high schools, the demonstrations ... everything is ours because we carry in ourselves the rage to defeat and Put down the bourgeoisie and on its smoking ruins, raise socialism! So comrades, let's go back our sleeves and work twice as hard with twice as much revolutionary optimism! We are the 5th <br/><br/> Son and daughters of the Immortelle Commune of Paris! We end this text by expressing warm greetings to the glorious poor peasant masses of Brazil who carry in them the new world and to the Palestinian masses, and their glorious fighters, and include our flags in tribute, both show us the self -denial that we must do Proof to shoot imperialism! Palestine will win ! Greetings Red! National Bureau of the Revolutionary Youth League, March 2024 6 <br/><br/>   The revolution will come from working -class neighborhoods! 2023 France is the 7th world economic power and more than 7 million people among the 9.3 million on the poverty line depend on food aid. The conclusion is clear. Of these 7 million people the food bank helps 2.1 million, the 7 <br/><br/> Restos du Coeur 1 million, less than half. The local bunk of solidarity grocery stores, packages or food distribution are mainly, once again, women (72%), among which 40% are mother of single -parent families. If in mainland France the highest poverty rate reaches 27% in Seine-Saint-Denis, it reaches 33% in Reunion, for an intensity of poverty reaching 19.7% (no data is produced by the 'INSEE concerning Mayotte, Guyana or Guadeloupe). Note that the Restos du Coeurs, an association ensuring 35% of food aid in France, have no delegation in the territories occupied by France overseas. But it is the workers who create wealth, the bourgeois grab this wealth and in the face of the crisis, the latter increase prices (charges, food, care, with in ﬂ ation in particular ...) and must lower wages (and/or the number of workers) to continue to get worse and cope with imperialist competition, thus accentuating in a vicious circle this 8 <br/><br/> process. To hide their crime, they donate to good works and count on the people to stop the hemorrhage. To hide the fact that solidarity is no longer enough, because soon no one will be able to give solidarity, the crime will be put on the back of the immigrant proletariat, accused of stealing well -deserved aid of "good French". But in the queue for food packages, we see who are our brothers and who are our executioners. Our brothers are those who, like us, depend on a liter of milk, unsold to survive, and for us misery has only one color. We will always refuse this Chauvinist logic, paving the way to fascism, which would make us believe that some deserve to starve, when others are tens of millions of euros, which would make us believe that the division and the resident problem within the group of hungry. The old bourgeois state has shown us that it would do nothing for us, that only our own solidarity could make us survive, and we have learned the lesson. Faced with these crimes perpetrated by the bourgeoisie, here and elsewhere, we are going to cherish and make this solidarity fail, but we will never lose sight of the culprits and we slaughter them. 9 <br/><br/> Our activists tirelessly develop a real mass work, in the service of the people and their youth. We mean by "mass work" the political work consisting in binding by practice with the oppressed classes to walk on the path of our emancipation. This is the main revolutionary work that we have to carry out today. This materializes by taking control of concrete problems, especially in the districts where misery is concentrated, fuel of the revolution, with them and not for them, to bring a framework and a method of struggle and to fight until 'to victory. Concretely, this can go through campaigns on Crous housing, actions on study conditions or at the heart of employee workers for students, for example. This also involves developing deep and methodical work at the heart of the popular districts of France, to organize them towards the Revolution. A job that we started and that we have to accentuate. We call on all the rebels to organize collectively to put an end to this dying system. Popular solidarity and economic struggle are the breeding ground that will grow the seeds of political struggle, to walk on the path of the Revolution, alone capable of completely getting rid of this parasite that is capitalism and establishing a regime where everyone will eat their hunger, will live with dignity of their work and where the riches will no longer be stolen in favor of a minority. That is to say, the socialist system! 10 <br/><br/> Faced with misery, popular solidarity! Against the bourgeoisie that strengthens us, join the ranks of the Revolution! The pension battles: Saint-Etienne, April 2023 11 <br/><br/> For many months, the French proletariat was found in the streets, in factories and on blockages to defend its retirement system, a legacy won over by our glorious 150,000 armed communists during the Resistance. This bourgeoisie attack will not remain unpunished! The working class entered the battle after fairly calm first weeks, before the February storm. We were able to observe the union bases finding the practice of the "radical", combative struggle and starting to overflow the framework imposed by their directions. Youth has once again stood out by their passion. It is essential to start taking advantage of our experience, although a real mature assessment requires time and hindsight. Grenoble, March 2023 This great moment of history was an opportunity to fight ever more than 12 <br/><br/> Ardently for the Revolution in demonstrations, but also in our unions, in our neighborhoods and our universities. In a climate of militarization of society and disturbing drought, capitalism is still sinking more into its end -of -life crisis. And once again, the masses were combated, determined to fight; But deprived of an organization capable of leading them to victory, they found themselves tossed between the walls of shields of the CRS and the union directions in co-management with the power in place. Toulouse, February 2023 we wore throughout this battle a combative and anti-opportunistic class line. It front of Bourgeoisie attacks: class unit! The struggles in all sectors, from factories to universities, were a school for revolutionaries in training, a school to learn to take the initiative and to demonstrate a determination to mobilize, to make politics and to defend claims with students, and to organize disorganized people who are tired of undergoing and who want to unite their forces 13 <br/><br/> To change this system. General assemblies, strike stakes and demonstrations have taught us to identify opportunism in all its forms. It emerges from this movement that it is mainly the practice that counts, that speeches sound hollow if they are not followed or preceded by combative actions, and that everyone aspires to an orientation, a direction, a structuring. The fight against opportunism is also a fight for democracy, because there is a strong disorganization of the class and the weight of bourgeois ideology pushes to atomization. We were able to observe how, from one general meeting to another, opportunistic elements tried to bypass the democratic framework. Saint-Etienne, March 2023 The government showed, through this reform and the level of repression used, that it was in total break with the masses. Illusion 14 <br/><br/> Pseudo-democratic and the parliamentary circus were highlighted during this social movement, and the veil rises a little more each time in the eyes of the masses. Even the media apparatus, which has activated, found itself caught in its own contradictions when journalists were able to see the abuse of repression live, rubbed shoulders of all ages and interviewed specialists documenting arduousness at work. The most basic common sense was put to the test in the face of pension reform, even the most convinced bourgeois democrats starting to doubt. These signs bear witness to the political crisis faced by France, just like many other countries in the world, largely fueled by the economic crisis. The bourgeoisie begins to feel difficulties in governing as she wishes, while the masses refuse to be governed in the same way as before, thus announcing a crisis in the regime. 15 <br/><br/>   The visuals of the pension battle: 16 <br/><br/>   The major uprisings of June: following the execution of Nahel by the police, the youth of the districts revolted. For a week, intense clashes against the police and the state broke out, youth showing a level of combativeness up to the ignominy of crimes committed by the French state: destruction of neighborhoods, high unemployment rate, reduction reduction of 17 <br/><br/> Public services, abandonment of cultural programs, police harassment going to murder and constant insults of the media controlled by monopolies. Lyon, June 2023 during the uprisings, we observed the youth of the most disadvantaged strata launching into the clashes, with the participation of young people aged 12 to 13. Their daily life is marked by life in constantly prey to destruction, where all associative, cultural and sporting activity is based on the commitment of some inhabitants. They are educated in establishments of poor quality, without real prospects for the future, and are intended for the most painful trades, being convinced that their dreams will never come true. They see their parents working hard and win little. When they turn on television, they face insulting speeches excluding them from society. Faced with unemployment and difficulties in finding a job or training, this reality becomes their daily life. In parallel, they are aware that France is a rich country leading to military operations in the countries of origin of part of their ancestors. 18 <br/><br/> The assassination of Nahel is a blow to the whole of society, bringing up all the accumulated rage and the disgust towards such an unjust, cynical and corrupt society. What has aroused this revolt is what has always animated the oppressed against their oppressors since the dawn of time, and if it is the youth who found herself on the front line, it is because she perceives the future who awaits him and refuses to accept it. It takes immense bravery to confront a unity of police officers armed with LBD and chemical weapons, even weapons of war, and deploying anti-terrorist units. 19 <br/><br/> This situation re ﬂ ects the end -of -life crisis of capitalism. The pseudo-democratic illusions fade and anger rises from a notch, the political crisis which is looming is not a crisis within the masses, but a crisis between the masses and the holders of power. As Marx explained over 150 years ago, in France, there are two nations: that of the bourgeoisie in power and that of the masses; Basically, the situation has not changed much since 1848 and the violent crisis we are going to be confronted will be resolved by the organization of oppressors against oppressors for the conquest of power. 20 <br/><br/> The visuals of the major June uprises: break the walls of the university! 21 <br/><br/> The Revolutionary Youth League has started national work within universities, taking up the watchword of the revolutionary popular student movement (MEPR) of Brazil: "Let's slaughter the walls of universities!" Lyon, March 2023 Work in universities is a long-term work, which carries several necessities of major importance: 1. In addition to revisionism, opportunism and post-modernism that grow in university as in a breeding ground fertile. 2. Get the little-bourgeoisie as a necessary contribution to the Revolution. 3.Abat the ideology of the bourgeoisie, for a university and a science in the service of the people, to shoot down the walls of the university. 22 <br/><br/> The proletariat being a unique class, its youth must be organized as such, as its most combative fringe and with the engine the proletarian youth which has only its labor force to sell. Our role is to bring young people together and educate them in a revolutionary spirit. Youth must provoke and direct economic battles (source: resolution on the Communist International and the Communist Youth Movement). We will fulfill this role by following the 4 orientations of the glorious movements of Yenan's youth, cited by President Mao:  UNIR  LIKE TO MASS  FOLD  Produce 23 <br/><br/>   Proletarian internationalism: On October 7, 2023, the national resistance launched the operation "deluge of Al-Aqsa", thus bringing a rough blow to the state of Israel and American imperialism. Our support for the national resistance has therefore strengthened, in connection with the situation. 24 <br/><br/> Lyon, October 2023 in our neighborhoods, in Lyon and Toulouse, the large masses gathered despite the prohibitions and criminalization to make their support for the just national liberation struggle of the Palestinian people. Toulouse, October 2023 The Palestine flag is brought to the highest by our activists, well 25 <br/><br/> Before October 7 and until the release of the Palestinian people from sea in the Jordan! Toulouse, October 2023 26 <br/><br/> Let's free Georges Abdallah! The League engages alongside the unitary campaign for the release of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah! Lyon, September 2023 27 <br/><br/> 28 <br/><br/> Against French imperialism! 29 <br/><br/> Daily work: The revolutionary situation in unequal development in the country is a fact, but we must keep and not to say, as some affirm, that we live an insurrectional or pre-insurgent situation. An insurrectional situation requires that the 30 <br/><br/> class be organized and aware, we are only in the beginnings. On the other hand, the situation of deep economic and political crisis in depth destabilizes society, and creates a situation of development crisis in development. This crisis is already rampant and is already strengthening the state machine, because as Friedrich Engels learned from us: "All upheavals have only perfect this machine - the state - instead of breaking it. This is the only way for the bourgeoisie to respond to the deep crisis that agitates the country and the world. On the other hand, we know strong social movements and uprisings which present an insurrectionary aspect like the glorious uprisings of June, but the global situation of society itself is not. In our time of crisis of rotting and end of life of capitalism which is deepened and which generates a reactionnarization 31 <br/><br/> Constant, it is necessary to decide with what has already been dead and buried for a long time: militant sectarianism, the above -ground and separate claims of the masses, marginality. The militant environment collapsed for lack of having had a program and a concrete action plan, and comes down to virtual quarrels that do not interest anyone and especially not the masses. We offer concrete struggles, anchored in practice then join us and fight! Paris, May 2023 we have Need to bring together and unite the combative youth of this country on issues that concern them closely to organize by collective struggle the solving its problems. Youth must be organized by itself, breaking with the bounded opportunism of parties and organizations which require permission to the State and are 32 <br/><br/> co -management of misery. We only trust in the masses, in his youth particularly, and none in the politicians and professionals of the spectacle and in their hollow speeches. We are of course linked these struggles to those of the proletariat in general. Our guiding principles are therefore:  We organize at the base, independently vis-à-vis the State, by applying democratic centralism, the only true form of democracy in the service of struggles lutter for and with proletarian youth and that it directs the Youth Movement, including more broadly the student and Petite-Bourgeoise youth  Look on concrete points, link with the survey and practice 33 <br/><br/> Daily, to win victories, on concrete claims of the masses  Organize revolutionary violence to put down the old state and the bourgeoisie  Litect against revisionism and opportunism organize youth to fight the many important problems Ci, give meaning to our existence in the face of the overwhelming adversity of the system. We want to find a feeling of belonging, a goal, a reason to move and immerse yourself entirely! 34 <br/><br/> Saint-Etienne, May 2023 lead the fight alongside the popular masses, because they are our parents, our friends, our colleagues and because we are an integral part. Let us tear off the power of the hands of the bourgeoisie, from the ruling classes who think they can use us from the beginning of our lives until its end and give it back to the people. Only our class, the proletariat, is able to shape the world of tomorrow! 35 <br/><br/> Lyon, March 2023 Bringing opportunism. We refuse any attempt at corruption and it is out of a question to waste our time with the electoral game which has proven well for generations that it does not allow you to change things, only to fill the pockets of politicians. Our principles are what we are and what we want, we will never abandon them. We are not here to obtain a place in a warm in a town hall or in a parliament, and denounce those who use struggles for their interests. Thus, we fight with all our strength to serve the people putting the interests of the collective before ours. We say it, our practice proves it and time will inscribe it in marble! 36 <br/><br/> Fight with all our strength. Too many groups multiply statements and speeches so that they will never have the courage to lead a resolved struggle for their ideals. It is time to break our links with these practices, to get rid of our simple reveries to give them shape. We do not fear being on the front line, with a fighting spirit every day renewed and to pay the price of our commitments. 37 <br/><br/> Fight for the socialist revolution. This is the solution to solve youth problems. It is fighting for a company led by the creators of wealth, the working class; For a society where democracy is applied for the greatest number and dictatorship for exploiters, the opposite today. It is the collectivization of the means of production, the nationalization of banks, the closure of the scholarship, the pooling of all wealth. These are the base assemblies to discuss and solve all our daily problems. This is the path to go from the reign of necessity to that of freedom (Karl Marx). 38 <br/><br/> 39 <br/><br/> Saint-Etienne, October 2023 40 <br/><br/> War, defend and apply, mainly apply Marxism! Conferences, meetings, debates ... Lyon, September 2023 41 <br/><br/> Toulouse, May 2023 Paris, April 2023 42 <br/><br/> Commemorations Lyon, May 2023 43 <br/><br/>   Join the League! Only one place remains empty, yours! Do you want to join a league section in your city? Do you want to create your LJR section? Only one address: 44</p></div>

    On March 28 in Budapest, the second hearing of the trial in Ilaria Salis will be held. Ilaria is accused, together with Tobias and Gabriele, of having attacked the Nazis during the day of honor in Budapest in February 2023. From 11 February last year he has been held in a Hungarian prison in inhuman conditions, very similar to those of 41 bis in Italy.

    On March 23 in Rome, about 200 people found themselves, after a month and a half, in Piazza Sassari in the procession "neither prison nor extradition" to manifest solidarity with Ila, Gabri and Tuttx LX Compagnx Convrtx in the events of Budapest, as well as In solidarity with Anan and the arrested Palestinian companions, of which Israel asked for extradition.

      I am quite getting used to being here and I don't think it is my merit, but that these places are made in such a way that people get used to staying there. Now, when they open the door of the cell to me because I have to go somewhere, I stop towards the wall to make me search, instead of starting to wander around with great naturalness for the corridor as I did at the beginning. While I wait to receive the package with the slippers, every day I go to the showers bringing me under the branch of the laundry. In this situation we only miss mushrooms and warts! I am also very heartened by the fact that the pigeons and all the inanimate objects that often address my monologues have never deigned to my response.

      The passage of time is really strange: the individual days are interminable, but the days follow each other quickly and I always seem to have been arrested last week. I don't have the perception of being away from Milan for more than a month. The events, the people, the places outside I feel close and live inside me. Perhaps the fact that not receiving news from the outside and that I have no contact with my world makes me feel in a kind of suspended bubble. It is a bit like time for me had stopped. There is no first one is a after but only the "inside" and the "outside": there are two absolutely incompatible worlds and my mind cannot place them on the same temporal axis. When you are "inside" the "outside" ceases to exist. Enter the bubble and the outside world dissolves, enters stand-by.

      I never have a precise idea of what hours they are. I don't know that now it's when they wake up, I just know I'm already training. At the changing of the morning guard is already light, as long as there is solar then. Then they are very long hours that no longer pass, waiting to get to the air.

      After the trolley in the afternoon it is interminable and nothing happens more. The change of the evening guard for me marks the end of the day. Getting up to that hour every day is grueling and after that last ritual, which takes place when it is already dark, rather than falling asleep, I would say that I fell overlooking. I would happen on the cotted cot with any energy without paying attention to the pungent glow of the neon. The light of the cell can be turned out to turn out only from the outside: I don't know what time is accomplished the ritual of shutdown of the lights and I never remain wake up long enough to be able to assist you.

      During the last weekend of the month we move on to the legal time and, given that my only point of reference to sunlight, at this point I realize that some rituals take place definitely earlier than I thought and that perhaps I should review the my rhythms of life. The change of the evening guard now takes place shortly after the dusk, then definitely early. If I fall asleep at that time then it is normal that, when you have to wake me up, I am already in the middle of the training. What a mess! Even the simple things here become very complicated.

      Of a few experiences I have memory that they have been so complicated. Perhaps when at eight I found myself, from one day to the next, to attend the third grade in England, without speaking a word of English and without knowing anyone. Here, even there they had also been quite complicated there. Or, perhaps, when I learned to walk, but I was too small to remember it. In all those situations I was never alone. Here, however, you are completely alone and it is good not to trust anyone. And many many things inside are somewhat strange.

      The months are long and it happens that the bubble is transformed into a black hole that sucks you. Borrowing a metaphor that I will read several months later in a beautiful comic dedicated to my events, I fell into a very deep well. The walls are slippery and every time I struggle I try to take a short step to trace just a little, I always end up falling deeper. Sometimes I wonder if this well has a bottom and if there is really an exit somewhere. I guess they are a small gecko, who in silent darkness manages to climb the walls. Yes, I have to climb the walls, but here unfortunately there are no climbing companions and the ties of trust well on the rope of the "safe".

      In the mountains you secure each other, so that, if a slide, instead of flaringing the ground, is blocked by the counterweight of the other. And when in front of a slightly more complicated passage I block myself and I think I don't do it, they scream me that I will certainly do it and to pull on how I can. In fact, in the most difficult moments, in the face of the most threatening dangers, in front of unknown scenarios, you have to rely on your strengths and try unpublished strategies, where traditional techniques can nothing. Fortunately, sport taught me something about tenacity and fears. The fears, in some contexts in which self -preservation is at stake, are not to be escaped or removed but must be treated and perceived clearly because they could be the key to your salvation.

      When you find yourself alone with yourself to scrape the slime in the bottom of the well, when fear becomes terror because you have no idea what is about to happen to you, then you see in yourself resources that you didn't know they belonged to you.

       But here what really allows you to face the deprivations and daily humiliations and to rescue the asset of the intellect (i.e. the most precious treasure that exists here) from the voracity of that monster called madness, is simpler to the time itself more complex than you can imagine. It is the ability to discern the sincere sincerity from the mystifying lie, the deep awareness, which dwells at the bottom of the heart, of what the right part of the story is.

       I close your eyes and throw the gaze beyond the walls of this blind prison: I see the events of men and women like spare parts in fabrics on tapestries depicting wider stories. Stories of peoples, cultures, languages and religions. History of economic, political and legal systems. Stories of wealth and misery, of power, of abuse and exploitation. Stories of wars and armies. Stories of a world in which children are still killed, in which machine guns resonate in the fourth of Europe that echo the havoc of the last century. I open my eyes and see me curled up on the covered gray, with a fixed look on the iron door of the cell. Everything appears to me simple and linear in these events, as in many others, there can be no doubt about what the right part of the story is.

   National Status Audience
  </a>
  , Santiago Pedraz, ordered the precautionary suspension of the Telegram application due to possible copyright infringement.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-df59c6161de292c2270adae395d4b559">
  On March 23, the news was known that a judge of the National Court, the court that has jurisdiction throughout the state, ordered Telegram's complete closure in the country because of a complaint of the great bourgeois press monopolies : Mediaset, Atresmedia and Movistar Plus. The reason was the alleged "unauthorized" use of audiovisual content owned by bourgeois press monopolies. That is, they ensure that their programs were shared “illegally” by some channels of the Telegram messaging application.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-08ed5691e8d7a52012111ceb471af0e6">
  Given this accusation, the instruction judge ordered, in a precautionary way, to close the use of the messaging application while the investigation will be carried out. However, given the lack of compliance with the company, computer operators were decided to temporarily block the telegram connection in the Spanish State. The argument used by the judge is that, while the content is housed in the application, it is not excess of being able to complete the application.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bb4deed8c186d3e6af860b9f19f9ccb3">
  Although at no time did it stop working, and today March 25, the judge himself has reversed and has paralyzed his closure while the investigation lasts, being able to close in the future if the conviction is so decreed. Different "justice" organizations had made a complaint against the judge for serious, severe and unprecedented limitation of
  <a href="https://theobjective.com/espana/tribunales/2024-03-25/denuncian-juez-pedraz-prevaricacion-telegram/">
   Fundamental rights

  ”.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f1e1996b092227982268cce1d40d3cbe">
  Telegram is an application that in the Spanish State adds 8.5 million users, and is mainly known for its alleged greater security with respect to other instant messaging applications. This means that Telegram is not only used on a personal level, but that activist groups use this application as a method of disseminating their activities.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-362f066160efd3428dc8ea9ceb406033">
  Thus, this conviction, although not carried out at the moment, shows the tendency of the imperialist states to attack democratic rights. Prioritizing the "right" of the great communication monopolies to obtain economic revenue through their "intellectual property", it was aiming one of the most security applications that is known by the police that use the anti -fascist movements, of national liberation and of the movement for housing. These movements would have already been fiercely repressed through police infiltrations on several occasions, as we report in previous

   occasions

  .
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e3af5a42d139e76f05a58c5bb8a8031f">
  No application is completely safe. However, it is no accident that it has been indicated directly to Telegram, where political content is shared by different organizations. Moreover, when Telegram had already collaborated with the European bourgeois "justice" in a similar case (protection of "intellectual rights").

  Former President Jair Bolsonaro spent two nights at Hungary diplomatic headquarters at an apparent political asylum request. This occurred four days after Jair Bolsonaro was forced to deliver his passport during Operation Tempus Veritatis.
 </p>
<p>
  The operation of the Federal Police occurred from a decision of the Federal Supreme Court. She served arrest warrants, search and seizure and precautionary measures. Among the latter was precisely the delivery of Jair Bolsonaro's passport.
 </p>
<p>
  Bolsonaro spoke shortly after the news, confirming that he was at the Hungary embassy for two days. In an interview with Metrópoles newspaper, he stated:
 </p>
<p>
  “I won't deny that I was in the embassy. I won't talk where I was most. I keep a circle of friendship with some heads of state around the world. They are concerned. I talk to them subjects of interest to our country. And point. The rest is speculation ”,
 </p>
<p>
  According to the images obtained by the New York Times, you can see Jair Bolsonaro walking on the embassy. Your car came in shortly thereafter. According to the US newspaper of the US communication monopoly, the former president spent two days in the embassy accompanied by two security guards. He was accompanied by the Hungarian ambassador and members of the diplomatic team.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, besides the articulation of the far right, Bolsonaro did not do it just to "talk to heads of state." It was also to prevent a prison, since, by law, the embassy is out of reach of the national authorities.
 </p>
<p>
  This is not the first time Bolsonaro plans to escape to get rid of arrests. On December 29, 2022, the captain traveled to the United States in a double goal: first, to avoid being involved with what was happening in the following days (which was confirmed on January 8); Second, to avoid passing the presidential range to Luiz Inacio. This time Bolsonaro tried to escape to Hungary so as not to be arrested.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Hungarian political analyst says Bolsonaro would receive asylum in Hungary
  </strong>
</h4>
<p>
  In an interview with the Press Monopoly O Globo, Hungarian political analyst Gyula Nagy, professor at the University of Corvinus, said that: “If Bolsonaro asks Orbán for help, the answer will be positive. They are allies, I would say that friends. ”
 </p>
<p>
  About this, the analyst recalled that this type of asylum has been offered by Orbán to other far right politicians before. In 2018, former Northern Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski received the status of political refugee in Hungary after being the target of a series of corruption, extortion, electoral manipulation, among others. It would be not new to Hungarian politics, therefore, if another right-wing and well-known former criminal asylum asylum, as it seems that Bolsonaro is doing.
 </p>
<p>
  The analyst's speeches confirm the analysis that the revealed articulation represents a coordination of the far right at the international level.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Alexandre de Moraes gives Bolsonaro 48 hours to clarify his visit
 </h4>
<p>
  On March 26, STF Minister Alexandre de Moraes opened 48 hours for the former president to clarify the reason for his 2-day stay at the embassy. Bolsonaro's visit can be configured as an attempt to evade the country not to be arrested.
 </p>
<p>
  Article 312 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that one of the reasons for pre -trial detention is the risk of non -compliance with criminal law, ie escape or risk of escape. In this sense, it would mean non -compliance with one of the measures imposed by the Supreme Court and could motivate Jair Bolsonaro's request for arrest. However, the arrest should not occur due to the repercussion it would generate. It would have negatively reverberated as “persecution” and would also reinforce, in the far right discourse, the “judicial activism” on the part of the Supreme Court.
 </p>
<p>
  And an important addition on the case: journalist Túlio Amâncio reported that the Federal Police are studying the request for precautionary measures against the former president. Among them, the use of electronic anklet. The assessment is that it is not yet time for a pre -trial detention.

</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  After just over a year of the SVM government, the political situation in Denmark has changed drastically. The government was planned and established at the end of 2022 after it became clear to the bourgeoisie that they could not continue their way of prevailing, as they did during it mistakenly called "Corona crisis". After Russian imperialism's war of aggression against Ukraine, many imperialist countries began, especially in the West, to accelerate their buildup. Denmark is not an exception, and from there came the necessity of the bourgeoisie of a centralized executive power to undergo militarization: the SVM government.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The government was founded on hypocrisy and lies from the start. The parties Left and the Moderates both went up for election as opposition parties to Mette Frederiksen and her tyranny and handling of the pandemic, but both ended up as her two lap dogs with prestige ministerial posts by each government party. The government did not waste time and steep abruptly abolishing big prayer day despite opposition, citizen proposals and public revolt to preserve it. Since then, the government has been responsible for the reactionutory of the bourgeois Danish state, with a centralization of the executive power of the power of power, a growing militarization of both police and military and a growing social chauvenism and imperialist aggression.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the government has been discredited from day one and has become a historic government both because of its character as a majority government, but also by its low legitimacy towards the population-the SVM government has quickly become the most hated government for a long time.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The government has trumped both the permanent posting of Yankee troops in Denmark, along with the fact that more than 2% of GDP will now be used on the military. But at the same time, the government is currently losing its majority as up to several politicians such as Mads Fuglede has switched to the Danish Democrats and that the moderates have lost two mandates because they have become too obscene. Among other things. Has Jon Stephensen with his inappropriate messages to a 19-year-old youth partyer and 28-year-old Mike Fonseca with his grooming of a 15-year-old meant that the government has lost up to several mandates in the Folketing, which now threatens its character as a majority government. This is currently putting the government in a crisis where it must either reveal itself even more and enter into alliance with discredited figures or find other solutions.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At the same time, the SVM government and especially Mette Frederiksen have been discredited with their continued active support for Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people. This despite the change of their strategy from open condemnation of the Palestinian resistance struggle, to public silence, but continued support for Israel. What you can see from this is a government that is weakened and revealed to and hated by the people. The government is an expression of the deep crisis and decay of Danish imperialism and imperialism in general. Government has continued to reveal the democratic facade and bluf democracy in Denmark in the same way the former government did during the pandemic. At the same time, it shows how the people continue to fight and resist the government and that the abolition of Great Prayer Day, the Militaryization and the Bourgeisie's support for Israel reveals how the interests of the proletariat in Denmark are completely incompatible with imperialism.

  In recent days, several Russian imperialist state officers have blamed Ukraine and imperialist countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom for the recent Islamic State attack on Khorasan (EI-K) against a home of

  </em>
  In Moscow, Crocus City Hall. Organizations and newspapers in the country say that the Putin regime will seek to use the attack to deepen the repression against the Russian people, while fascist groups can increase actions against immigrants and inhabitants of most Muslim regions such as Caucasus. Official pronouncements camouflage the true and possible origins of the attack by EI-K in Russia, such as the different wars of aggression made by Soviet social-imperialism and Russian imperialism against Arab countries and Muslim population.
 </p>
<p>
  The attack took place on March 22 and killed more than 130 people during a Picnic band show at Crocus City Hall, home -based events home. Shortly after the attack, EI-K issued a statement by which he claimed the authorship of the attack. Next to the text, a video was made available in which it showed four men performing the robbery, made with machine guns, grenades and cocktails

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  History of aggression
 </h4>
<p>
  Despite attempts by the Russian imperialist state officers to annul the issue for their own purposes, there is no shortage of motivations for EI-K combatants to attack Moscow. The group, which operates in Tajiquistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Jammu and Caxemira, has accused the Russian state of "enemy" more than once, for different reasons. Among them are the invasion and annexation of the Russian imperialist state in Chechnya, a territory of a Muslim majority; The support of Putin to Bashar al-Assad regime, president of Syria (where the Islamic State acts against both the Russian Lacaio regime and against the US presence); And in more remote times, the war of aggression of social-imperialism Soviet to Afghanistan.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, Russian imperialism nourishes a history of extensive crimes against the peoples of oppressed nations of a Muslim majority, such as sending Russian or mercenary troops to certain regions of Muslim population such as Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Sudan. Official justifications for troop sending are the fight against Islamic groups such as JNIM, but there are records of massacres and torture of the people by Russian troops and sagging by the Wagner group of African natural riches. A survey of the News Portal
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/26/attack-of-the-isis-k-in-moscow-the-war-comes-back-to-the-russias-heart/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   The red herald
  </a>
  He also appointed the Russian intervention in the Tajiquistan Civil War and the dominion in Kazakhstan and Kyrguistan.
 </p>
<p>
  This is not the first time EI has performed an attack on Russian targets. In 2022, EI-K attacked the Russian embassy in Cabul, the capital of Afghanistan. In 2015, IS claimed the attack against an airplane from Egypt toward Russia. EI-K seeks, like JNim in Africa, to increase its influence on the regions that acts by reaching targets such as Russian imperialism, hated decades by local masses by successive wars of aggression and interventions.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Putin regime manipulations
 </h4>
<p>
  Without touching any of these points, imperialist Putin gave the first statement about the case 19 hours after the attack. In it, it did not mention the pronouncement of EI-K. On March 26, Putin admitted the presence of “radical Islamists” behind the attack, but also pointed to collaborations from Ukraine. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was more striking, and stated in an article published in the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that uses it was evoking the "bug-bug" of the Islamic State to cover its "wings" in Kiev. Already Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, stated that "obviously it was Ukraine." Alexander Bortnikov, director of the Russian Federal Security Service, said "the terrorist attack on" Crocus "was prepared by Islamic radicals, but both western intelligence services and Ukrainian intelligence services were directly involved in him."
 </p>
<p>
  To this day, Russian imperialism has arrested eight suspects of participation in the attack. On Saturday, four were already in pre -trial detention. Three others were arrested on Monday. On March 26, another suspect was arrested. According to the Russian communication monopolies, two of the accused revealed that they participated in the attack. There is no information on the content of the testimonies of others. On March 25, four of the prisoners who were taken to court had clear marks of torture, among them bruises, swelling and the possible lack of an eye. One of the suspects was in a wheelchair.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Repression of democratic freedoms and 'nationalist and chauvinist order'
 </h4>
<p>
  Certain press agencies in Russia point to the Putin regime and the ruling classes seek to use the attack to “further limit citizens' freedoms and introduce new laws that prohibit any form of protest” and “imposing an increasingly chauvinist nationalist order on country, ”as the Russian newspaper said
  <em>
<a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/26/russia-the-reaction-is-using-the-tragedy-at-crocus-city-hall-for-its-own-purposes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Serve the people
   </a>
</em>
  . The same newspaper mentions that Russian fascist groups may want to respond to attack with chauvinist aggressions and persecution against the Muslim population of regions such as Caucasus or Immigrants.
 </p>
<p>
  It is well known that, internally, Putin's regime also faces great popular resistance because of the wars of aggression it wages. Since launched the War of Aggression to Ukraine, there have been several laws approved to suppress the manifestations that pulled in the country to reject the invasion of the Ukrainian territory and to condemn the imperialist regime. Recruitment centers were even attacked with
  <em>
   Molotov
  </em>
  in some of the protest acts. Last week, during the election period, voting booths were also set on fire by protesters contrary to the regime.

<p>
  A delegate and three investigators of the Amazonas Civil Police were arrested on March 24, along with six active military police and a former PM under the flagrant of criminal association, kidnapping, extortion and other accusations. The case occurred in the municipality of Manacapuru, about 100km from the Amazonian capital.
 </p>
<p>
  The agents were identified as the delegate Ericson de Souza Tavares, head of the 6th Integrated Police District of Manaus, investigators Eliezio de Castro, Anderson de Almeida and Alessandro da Cruz, PMs Alexandro dos Santos, sergeant of the corporation, as well as the Cables Jozimo da Silva, Eldon de Souza, Ueslei Rodrigues, Kemer Pimentel, Edvaldo Pinto. Along with them, former police officer Germano da Luz Junior was also arrested.
 </p>
<p>
  The blatant came when, on March 24, the agents broke into the neighborhood of the current, in the municipality of Manacapuru, and kidnapped a man and a woman. The relatives of the victims then went to look at them at the police station, since the men presented themselves as police, and, with no record there, began a complaint that led to the arrest of the paramilitarians.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the ongoing investigations, the common practice of the agents was to kidnap and torture people involved with drug trafficking so that they could intercept the narcotics and thus sell them to other groups.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Paramilitaries kept an arsenal available
 </h4>
<p>
  Next to the paramilitarists were seized 22 porters, plus 17 firearms (some, with scraped numbering) and 207 varied ammunition. Nine mobile phones, three falsified cars, three vest covers, two ballistic vests, three holloves, balaclavas and handcuffs were also found.
 </p>
<p>
  The robustness of tampered equipment, as well as the discharge in the involvement of civil and military agents gives us an idea of how so organized are becoming the paramilitary groups formed by police in the state of Amazonas.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The number of cases of paramilitary involvement with repressive forces of the state grows
 </h4>
<p>
  In addition to the growing scandals involving police brutality, cases of torture or summary executions that have been increasing among operations and patrols, there is also a growing in the event of organization of police groups and former police for paramilitary functions in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  Only in the year 2023 is this the third case of involvement of these groups with drug trafficking. In January,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/am-oficiais-da-pm-sao-presos-por-desviarem-drogas-no-valor-de-r-6-milhoes/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   4 PMs of Manaus were arrested for deviation of about 250 kg of cocaine
  </a>
  . Already in February,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/am-9-pms-sao-presos-por-desvio-de-meia-tonelada-de-drogas/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Another 9 PMs, mostly associated with the Tactical Force, were caught diverting about 500 kg of drugs
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The criminal activities of these agents are not limited, however, only to drug trafficking, also having one of their main focuses on performing clandestine executions. Of these, the involvement of one of the figures of this case is key: former policeman Germano da Luz Junior.
 </p>
<p>
  Germano became known in the underworld of the extermination groups for his extensive record in these actions. The former PM who was recently sentenced to 11 years in prison for executing a uniformed colleague suspected of a loan scheme, is also known for his participation in the episode called Bloody Weekend in 2015 in Manaus, where the military murdered Cold blood 34 people.

  On March 24, the Remís Carla Women Group held a meeting with the residents of the Popular Condominium Esplanada celebrating March 8 (International Proletarian Women's Day). At the time, they denounced the neglect of years and years by the City of Guarulhos and previous administrations to maintain the place. After a storm in December 2023, blocks 6 and 13 were harshly affected by detachment and are suffering serious structural and sanitary risks. Residents also deal with lack of light and severe infiltration in the apartments.
 </p>
<p>
  The meeting debated the origin of the date, female oppression, and, within this, domestic work and class character of the “Women's Day”, truly international day of proletarian women, pointing out the differences between the conditions of exploiting women and those working women. There was also the popular struggle as a mandatory way to achieve their liberation.

  The residents of the Esplanada Condominium, in the neighborhood of Pimentas, took advantage of the event to bring punctual problems that afflict them and their families. The locality developed from 2012 with the relocation of people from other outskirts of the municipality, such as São João and Vila Any, and never received due maintenance. “They played us like an animal,” denounced a woman.
 </p>
<p>
  Size is the neglect that the documents of possession of the apartments were only made available last year and under the collection of R $ 155. Residents report coexistence problems caused by drugs and lack of leisure, as well as failures in the supply of water, energy, energy, and gas. It's been months that the blocks have been without light.

  In the project promised by then mayor Elói Pietá (PT at the time), it was guaranteed that the condominium fee would not be charged, which did not remain over time. Many residents boycott the collection in protest against the misuse of money. Most previous liquidators have committed screaming cases of corruption, such as selling apartments, stealing from cash, not reporting spending, and missing the payment of cleaning, maintenance, and concierge. For this reason, there are processes in the name of the condominium that total more than R $ 200 thousand.
 </p>
<p>
  When a storm caused blocks 6 and 13, the last liquidator prohibited a report to report it, claiming that it was necessary not to give a breach to talk about labor proceedings. She also worked in the neighboring private condominium called Dunas, is related to a police officer, and barred the activities of the Popular Solidarity Student Committee (CESP), promoted by students of the Public College in front (Unifesp). The workers cherish the health and safety of the owners, stating “What if anyone dies? Will it import the process?

The walls are taken by the mold and moist to the touch, while the new gateway has been swollen and a metal piece on the stop causes electric shock on the routing. Several points of the ceiling have leaks fed by the puddles on the terrace. City agents have installed a canvas that cannot prevent their formation and feeds the proliferation of mosquitoes.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We have often reported on the imperialist mega project of the Interocean Corridor on the isthmus of Tehuantepec. This is an industrial and logistics project that consists of a rail connection in the southern Landesge Mexico, which connects the Pacific and Atlantic and is to be used for goods transport. On the other hand, there are parallel to the rail connection, a federal road, ten industrial parks and a gas pipeline. The central component of the whole is that both the Atlantic Hall Coatzacoalcos and the Pacific Hall Salina Cruz are to be expanded to modern industrial ports with a multiplication of their current container capacities.
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/mexico-latifundiarios-e-pistoleiros-promovem-ataque-contra-camponeses-em-tehuantepec/,">
   This project centered around the rail connection is rounded off by a militarization of the entire area by the old Mexican state.
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Building on this, we particularly see the bureaucratic capitalism and semi -colonial character of Mexico and why imperialist mega projects such as the Interocean corridor are so exemplary for this.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Such a project like the Interocean corridor costs billions of dollars to finance everything. Part of it, more precisely $ 2.8 billion
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-American_Development_Bank#Member_state_comparison_table">
   are through the so -called Inter American Development Bank (IDB)
  </a>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   But this is just a particularly obvious example of the semi -colonial character of suppressed nations such as Mexico. It becomes a little more difficult if you then look at the billion dollar investments that flow from Mexican hands into the imperialist mega project.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   The rail network of the Interocean Corridor is built by a subsidiary of the "Grupo Mexico". This subsidiary belongs to 74% of the "Grupo Mexico" and 26% to the US group "Union Pacific". The "Grupo Mexico" hereinafter referred to as "GM", but not only runs almost all rail networks in Mexico, but is primarily known for this to be the third largest copper producer in the world and to enter billions in profits. The Mexican Velasco family and its chief Larrera have over 66% of the majority of the multi -illium monopoly and are among the richest people in the world.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   This leads to the revisionist to the idea of leading the "GM" and the Velasco family as a prime example to "prove" that Mexico would be an imperialist country with its own large monopolies. And yet it is exactly the other way around, the "GM" is a real prime example of the development of bureaucratic capitalism through imperialism. In contrast to the allegations of the revisionists, the "GM" and its history are not an independent development of Mexican monopolies which make up part of an alleged Mexican imperialism, but about bureaucratic capitalism is developed by imperialism.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/grupo-mexico-s-a-de-c-v-history/">
    The story of "GM" does not start with Mexican capital, but begins with the American capitalist family Guggenheim in 1880.
   </a>
   At that time, the Guggenheims invested in mining and enamel operations in the USA. In 1889 Guggenheim persuaded Mexican mine owners to send their silver ores to his melt in the USA. The following year, the US Congress adopted high import duties for ores. Whereupon the Guggenheims in 1882 and 1885 only melt and then bought entire mines in Mexico. As early as 1901, the Guggenheim melts processed 40% of the lit and 20% of the silver which was mined in Mexico. A short time later, the Guggenheims bought a great participation in the Yankee mining conglomerate "Asarco". In the following decades, the Guggenheims bought or founded numerous mines and melting in Mexico and then put them under the control of this Yankee conglomerate. At the same time, millions of dollars also flowed into the development of technologies in the Guggenheim “Asarco” mines in Mexico. For example, for increased electricity production for more efficient minerals.
  </p>
<p p="" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    In 1997, GM founded a subsidiary with the U.S. company Union Pacific and leased the operating rights to the Mexican rail network from the Mexican government for 50 years. This lease was financed by U.S. capital, namely Wall Street loans. It wasn't until 1999 that GM really became what it is today, when it bought its former parent company "ASARCO" and took over its business in the USA, Peru and other countries.

  Before giving the case Marielle closed, the Federal Police should clarify a key issue: who were the political mentors of the councilwoman's murder? Specifically, the PF should have summoned the army commanders of the time and deeply investigate the Bolsonaro family connection with the principals and executors. In addition to clarifying the existing incongruities from previous moments, when investigations were known, they suffered from obstructions. Without clarifying such points, it will be an illusion to think that the case is closed, that the principals were punished and that the power structure that commanded the political crime will not continue with the same acting that is typical to it.
 </p>
<p>
  The great conclusion of the PF report is that Ronnie Lessa met three times with the Brazão family (pointed out as the “home team”) in which she received the commission of murdering Marielle Franco. However, there is no concrete proof of these meetings. There is also no evidence of the Brazão family meeting with Rivaldo Barbosa, which is appointed as responsible for performing a “thorough planning”. The PF report merely approved Ronnie Lessa's STF and give the case as solved.

<p>
  No one with a minimum of knowledge of the power structure in Rio de Janeiro doubt that Civil Police heads and Brazão strain deputies are involved in political crimes of this feat. However, it is not reasonable to accept that the real interested parties are not pointed out in the murder of Marielle Franco through a political attack that would have huge repercussions. Especially because a crime with

  PF gave up investigating the visit of Élcio de Queiroz on the day of the murder, to the Bolsonaro house in the Vivendas da Barra condominium, west of Rio de Janeiro. There is only one quote to the Bolsonaro family throughout the report, in order to state how Domingos Brazil was favored by the appointment to the State Court of Auditors.
 </p>
<p>
  The PF report also does not mention the role of Walter Braga Netto in the appointment of Rivaldo for the head of the Civil Police, even after the general received guidance from military intelligence discouraging the nomination. Report signed by Jefferson Miola, published in the digital magazine Jacobin Brazil, says that “the information circulates that the order to play Rivaldo Barbosa to control and manipulate the investigation
  <strong>
   came from a level above Braga Netto himself
  </strong>
  ”. Who was above Braga Netto?
 </p>
<p>
  To answer this, the PF would need to reassemble 2018 in Rio de Janeiro, when Army Commander Eduardo Villas-Bôas chose Walter Braga Netto as the federal intervener in Rio de Janeiro and Richard Nunes as Secretary of Public Security. Two years later, already in the general clamor for answers to the Marielle case, Walter Braga Netto stated that the resolution of the issue was "a matter of honor." According to journalist Humberto Trezzi, since 2020 the Army has “a database of the Civil and Military Police”, after Braga Netto won “from friends the reputation of having the CPF, name and address of each militia in Rio”. The commanders of the time should be summoned by the PF to provide clarifications about the episode. Or is this a matter whose full and complete clarification doesn't matter to the military?
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, as long as ideological and political mentors are not properly discovered, there is no basis for stating that the case was closed. Even less than the outcome of the case represented “a state victory over the crime” - as said the minister of government of Luiz Inacio.

  The hypocritical air-drop-aid continues to kill instead of helping. While several children reportedly drowned while trying to get aid which landed in the Mediterranean, 18 Palestinians were directly killed due to a failed landing of aid.

  Meanwhile new information on the flour massacre has been
  <a href="https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6242/Report:-Israel-continues-to-violate-ICJ-ruling-on-Gaza">
   revealed
  </a>
  by Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor in Geneva: Targeting civilian gatherings around humanitarian aid trucks with direct gunshots, quad-copters, and Israeli tank shells is one of the most well-documented examples of the unlawful killings and executions carried out by the Israeli army against Palestinian civilians over the past few weeks. These incidents, which have become known as the “Flour Massacres”, resulted in the deaths of 563 citizens and the injury of 1,523 others. This figure includes civilians awaiting aid and workers in charge of planning, securing, and distributing aid.

<p>
  The world-wide actions in solidarity with the people of Palestine continues.
 </p>
<p>
  In the
  <strong>
   US
  </strong>
  , activists have blockaded access points into a Kent weapons factory by lying across the road and locking themselves to gates. The factory, a subsidiary of Israeli drone manufacturer Elbit Systems, produces a range of weaponry and military equipment which is used in the ongoing genocide.

   reported
  </a>
  that Comrades attended the March 9th national march where over 400,000 people from all different backgrounds expressed great enthusiasm in denouncing the genocidal Israeli State. In the midst of this powerful mass demonstration, comrades engaged in mass work, speaking to the enraged masses from all walks of life, from men to women and religious to atheist to discuss the present Israeli assault on Palestine. Leaflets (Pictured above) were distributed to people whilst comrades engaged in conversation with them and they were received overwhelmingly positively. The need for a democratic, secular one State solution and the necessity for a united front against the Israeli fascist war machine was discussed thoroughly.

  In Glasgow a demonstration on the 10
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March showed the unwavering anti-imperialist spirit of the local people and their continued will to stand against the Israeli genocide which is being backed by the British Imperialist ruling class. Comrades in attendance noted the various advanced anti-imperialist lines expressed by the masses in their chants and discussions, linking the Palestinian struggle to the wider anti-imperialist struggle in places such as Yemen and Iraq. The marchers were also quick to reject the notions of “condemning both sides” and a “peaceful, two-state solution”, as pushed by the Imperialists and their supporters, who aim to contain and subdue the growing anti-imperialist movement and prevent it from unifying around a strong, revolutionary line.

  that on Friday, the 22
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of March, a demonstration “against genocide and occupation – freedom for Palestine” was organized in Bochum,
  <strong>
   Germany
  </strong>
  . A Speech by the Red League focused primarily on the question of the support of the National Resistance Front of Palestine against the genocide and the role of the imperialists, especially US imperialism. It spoke about different important questions that are relevant to the anti-imperialist and Palestine-solidarity movement in the FRG and, above all, made it clear the need for uncompromising anti-imperialism.

  The MLPD did not participate, because it had explicitly been forbidden by the Open Palestine Meeting, to bear flags of bourgeois parties. So they left the demonstration, since apparently their bourgeois respect was violated, since nobody wanted to distance themselves from the national resistance struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration reached its end in front of the Bochum town hall. On the route that led there, a flag of the Palestinian resistance, including the Red League logo, had already been hoisted across the main street during the day. It caused a lot of a stir and blocked traffic.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, a greeting from the comrades of the United Campaign for the Liberation of Georges Abdallah from France, which had sent a greeting to the demonstration in a great manner to show proletarian internationalism, was read out.

<p>
  The most important aspect of the march in Bochum was to consolidate a consistently anti-imperialist point of view among the participating forces. In the question of whether you are on the side of the oppressors or oppressed, there is no middle and those who represented this experienced a clear slap.

  On the 24
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March it was the 25
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  anniversary of the NATO-bombing of Yugoslavia. The consequences of the bloody attack against the sovereignty of the peoples of the Balkan continue to this day. The military alliance bombed for 78 days and nights, between 12,000 and 15,000 people were killed in this. Until this day the Austrian capital makes profit out of the war of Yugoslavia.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   NATO-bombs to “advance peace”?
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The war of Yugoslavia caused a deep split among the peoples of the Balkan. The aggression of NATO was carried out under the pretext of “advancing peace”. The “peace” established after the war meant from the beginning a territory occupied by the UN-troops named KFOR (Kosovo Force). These troops are a military formation under the leadership of the NATO. The KFOR-troops are formed by 28 States and comprise as of January 2024 of 4,443 soldiers. Also Austria sent until now regularly around 500 soldiers. From April a third of the company will retreat from Kosovo in order for it to be possible to set Austrian soldiers for the EU-combat troops. Not only was this always breaking the neutrality, but also the basis for making the Balkan-countries economically useful for the Austrian capital was created from the start.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   The “independent”
  </strong>
<strong>
   R
  </strong>
<strong>
   epublic
  </strong>
<strong>
   of
  </strong>
<strong>
   Kosovo
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In February 2008 the “independent Republic of Kosovo” was proclaimed. Still, Kosovo is led by the EU-council through a rule of law mission (EULEX Kosovo). This mission is supposed to support the construction of the Kosovar republic in the rule of law and the maintaining of the public order. With this a medium to secure the interests of the EU-imperialists in the Balkan was created. With the institutions of flimsy “peacekeeping” the efforts for the eastern expansion of the EU were secured. It cannot be called an “independent” republic if the State is led by an international military commission and there is permanent NATO-support bases in the country. This is clear proof of that the imperialists are not in the country for supporting peace but to secure their influence and their power.
 </p>
<p>

<strong>
   The mood of the population of the Balkan
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Even today the consequences of the Yugoslavia war are palpable. Still today also the ruling class of Austria make profit out of this war. Mass unemployment, corruption, bad living conditions are also today partly consequences of this war. The peoples on the Balkan protest since decades against corruption, against police repression, against the NATO-support bases and also against the efforts for joining the EU. In Croatia, as a EU-member State, the population also suffers from the introduction of the Euro.
 </p>
<p>
  In commemoration of the victims of the NATO-attack the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of the Balkan against the foreign rule must be supported and defended also by Austrian anti-imperialist forces.
