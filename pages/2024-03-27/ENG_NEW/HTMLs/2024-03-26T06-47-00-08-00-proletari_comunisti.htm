     Mayson 
  Majidi, 27 years old, Kurdish director and activist, after the escape 
 from Iran and the journey by sea, it ended up in spite of himself in the 
 Cyclope, in a prison in Castrovillari in Calabria.

   </span>

 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    <span>
     THE 
  Reasons why it had to escape are those shared by many others 
 people. Maysoon Majidi has become an uncomfortable figure in Iran after 
 The killing of Mahsa Amini, the 22 year old Kurdish killed by the police 
 Iranian.

   <span>
    <span>
     TO 
  following the death of this young woman, symbol of rebellion 
 In power and victim of the Iranian moral police, there was a wave 
 of protests to which director Maysoon Majidi, together with other women, has 
 actively participated so as to become, in turn, a figure 
 uncomfortable for the Iranian government and risk imprisonment.

   </span>

 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    <span>
     From 
  Here, in recent months, the escape from Iran and the arrival in Calabria on 31 
 December, where, a twist, he becomes for the prosecutor of Crotone a 
 "Suspect smuggler", an alleged trafficman of human lives, so with 
  This accusation, pending the trial, is locked up in the prison of 
 Castrovillari.
    </span>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    <span>
     In 
  This case the unjust imprisonment does not completely go unnoticed, 
 As very often, however, it happens in the case of migrant people who 
 land on our coasts and end up forgotten in structures 
 prisoners of various types.
    </span>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     Mayson 
  Majidi, perhaps supported by the idea that the abuses suffered in Italy were 
 inconceivable in a democratic country, he continues to wonder: "
     <em>
      Because I'm here
     </em>
     [in carcere]?’’.
    </span>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     This 
  It is the question that the Kurdish-Iranian activist continues to ask who are 
 visit because - seen with the eyes of those who run away from a regime for 
 fear of ending up in prison and then instead he finds himself held in it in 
 Italy, where he thought he could request international protection - 
 History takes on the characters of the nightmare that comes true.

   <span>
    <span>
     The 
  case of Maysoon is yet another demonstration of the hypocrisy of a class 
  politics that has pretended interest in the case of Mahsa Amini and the 
 Protests of Iranian women in order to make a drinking propaganda 
 Orientalist and Islamophobic, and then denying support to an activist 
 Kurdish-Iranian who fights against the abuse of the moral police.

 <p>
  <span>
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     Know 
  that Maysoon Majidi continues to be locked up in the prison of 
 Castrovillari is for us source of concern and indignation, and it is 
 For this reason that we have thought of activating ourselves, to make sure that 
  He does not remain alone to fight his battle in the Antro del 
 Cyclops.
    </span>
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    Against
 the Cutro decree and in solidarity with Maysoon Majidi and all 
Those fleeing for their resistance and struggle are imprisoned 
In the prisons of the various countries, a demonstration will be held on March 26 in 
starting at 10.00 a.m. a demonstration in front of the Castrovillari prison.
