 <p>
  A unit of the New People’s Army (NPA) in Agusan del Sur province recently reported a harassment operation against 3rd Special Forces Battalion (3rd SFB) operating troops in Barangay Mabuhay, Prosperidad on January 19, 2024. Two fascists were killed in the attack, including a mercenary officer. The NPA unit was able to withdraw safely.
 </p>
 <p>
  “The armed action is a response to the relentless focused military operation that covers the mountains bordering Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur,” according to the NPA-Agusan del Sur. It said military operations have disrupted the livelihood of the indigenous people and peasant masses since 2022.
 </p>
 <p>
  Clusters of communities are militarized to allow the entry of illegal logging of large trees such as Magkuno, Lawaan, Yakal and others. The operations are supervised by retired officer Captain Aranas of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the 3rd SFB.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, AFP focused military operations serve to protect large mines in the Caraga region (which includes Agusan del Sur province and Surigao del Sur province). The region contains two gold mines, one chromite mine, 18 nickel, one hydrometallurgical processing plant, and one gold processing plant. All mines are geared for export.
