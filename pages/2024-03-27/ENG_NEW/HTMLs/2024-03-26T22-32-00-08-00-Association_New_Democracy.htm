    Today, again, we consign 
 some facts appeared in the reactionary newspapers, where the 
 acute crisis in the heights of the old and rotten Peruvian state, state

 State that, with its spine the armed forces, police and forces 
 auxiliaries, holds and defends the old semicolonial and semi -feudal society 
 on whose basis a bureaucratic capitalism develops at the service

    In the last 
 days the reactionary newspapers of the press monopoly in Peru have given 
 Account of new corruption scandals The reactionary government of the fascist, genocidal and salepatria Dina Boluarte, 
 His parliament and other institutions and parties with his Old Old 
 Landowner-bureaucratic state at the service of imperialism mainly 
 Yankee. Everything indicates that every day that passes the situation of the reactionary government is aggravated: it can be said that it agonizes in an intensive care station.

 which far from placating the waters of reactionary political life in the country 
 He agitates them more. As can be seen from the 
 Note appeared today in the El Comercio reactionary newspaper (Lima), the 
 Boluarte government, is threatened to follow the same path as that of its 
 predecessors since 2016, that is, dismissal and jail, not for 
 crimes committed against the people but for the increasingly shameless and cynical 
 corruption from the president to the minor level representatives 
 District, etc. We will try to summarize the note a bit:

     Then the State and the economy can 
 function in "Automatic pilot", to this bureaucracy it was submitted and entrusted 
 Pedro Castillo, in his speech on July 28, 2021, Cusndo justified the

     Crisis of the old society, crisis of the 
 Bureaucratic capitalism and crisis of the old landowner-bureaucratic state, 
 that defends and holds it. Parliament crisis and all institutions 
 demo-bourgeois. Submission of the other powers to the Executive with the guarantee and 
 support of the reactionary armed forces and the bureaucratic apparatus of the 
 State. The thing does not change substantially for the current situation where the 
 existence of the current government hangs from the voluntad of the wall and the 
 existence of the current Parliament with its current penda composition of the will 
 of the genocidal president. Process of reacting of the old state, comes 
 Since the twentieth century.

 calm? It will never be calm, it is done in hard struggle between the factions and 
 groups of the great bourgeoisie and the struggle and resistance of the masses for rights, 
 freedoms and benefits that constitute the basis of its mobilization so that the 
 Party eleve them to political struggle, to fight for power through 
 Incorporation to the Popular War. That is why the 
 General reorganization of the party. President Gonzalo in the II Plenary says; 
 See new fascism, very important to deepen the study and foundations 
 that exist in "comments about the coup of 92" both in bourgeoisie 
 buyer as in the bureaucratic bourgeoisie.

 bureaucratic and nation-imperialism that will only be solved by carrying the 
 Democratic revoltion until the end with popular war.
