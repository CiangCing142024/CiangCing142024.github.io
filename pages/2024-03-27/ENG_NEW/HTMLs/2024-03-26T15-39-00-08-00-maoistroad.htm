 particular revolutionary value in the hearts of all of them

 Sukdev and Rajguru have been hanged by the British colonial power

 The victory of the Bolshevik revolution had influenced these three 
 Indian revolutionaries who formed HSRA (Association 
 Socialist revolutionary of Hindustan). Comrade Baghat Singh 
 he played a fundamental role in the formation of HSRA, and stated 
 clearly that who the color is the dominant classes, that 
 be of white, black or other skin, the struggle must be continued 
 against all exploiters.

      Let us
	continue our struggle to fulfill the dreams of all great martyrs of
	freedom movement and let us fight for a New Democratic India.

      <br/>
      In our
	long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a
	specific revolutionary place in the history of class struggle for
	all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at
	the same time that despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March,
	Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by
	the
      <br/>
      British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing
	anti-colonial freedom movement.
     </p>
     <p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
       <br/>
       After the
	formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country,
	and the Indian ruling classes: comprador big bourgeois and big
	landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any
	hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes
	after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
	native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the
	owners of the significant number of means of production of the
	country implemented distorted development industrial policy that
	benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial
	policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population
	of India.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
       With the entry of
	finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast
	scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people
	happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India
	continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than
	before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
	Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and
	Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk
	for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian
	resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All
	parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their
	party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has
	broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable
	misery to the toiling masses.

       <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
        <br>
         Development
	in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed
	people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for
	cheap natural resources that are available in the third world
	countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that
	mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To
	plunder the
         <br/>
         resources of India, Imperialism has backed every
	fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
	India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the
	Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried
	out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,
	Sendera, Operation Green-
         <br/>
         Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it
	has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of
	indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global
	finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden
	state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to
	fascist political system in India. Massive
         <br/>
         deployments of
	military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the
	plunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's
	resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,
	lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state
	under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry
	horrific
         <br/>
         news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It
	is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop
	until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is
	uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on
	the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in
	Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
         <br/>
         developed more
	brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the
	struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central
	and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting
	against this enemy's machines and methods.

	rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with
	revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
	seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat
	Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design
	of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

         In our
	long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a
	specific revolutionary place in the history of class struggle for
	all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at
	the same time that despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March,
	Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by
	the
         <br/>
         British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing
	anti-colonial freedom movement.

          <br/>
          After the
	formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country,
	and the Indian ruling classes: comprador big bourgeois and big
	landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any
	hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes
	after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
	native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the
	owners of the significant number of means of production of the
	country implemented distorted development industrial policy that
	benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial
	policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population
	of India.
         </p>
         <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
          With the entry of
	finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast
	scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people
	happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India
	continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than
	before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
	Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and
	Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk
	for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian
	resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All
	parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their
	party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has
	broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable
	misery to the toiling masses.

            Development
	in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed
	people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for
	cheap natural resources that are available in the third world
	countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that
	mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To
	plunder the
            <br/>
            resources of India, Imperialism has backed every
	fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
	India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the
	Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the imperialist carried
	out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum,
	Sendera, Operation Green-
            <br/>
            Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it
	has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of
	indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global
	finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden
	state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to
	fascist political system in India. Massive
            <br/>
            deployments of
	military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the
	plunder of the natural resources from the Adivasi region. People's
	resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages,
	lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state
	under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry
	horrific
            <br/>
            news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It
	is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop
	until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is
	uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on
	the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in
	Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
            <br/>
            developed more
	brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the
	struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central
	and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting
	against this enemy's machines and methods.

           Central Committee
	of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working-
	class, peasantry, dalits, and women's organizations, well- wishers
	of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human
	rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with
	revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
	seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat
	Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design
	of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.
