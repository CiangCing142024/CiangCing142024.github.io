 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Yesterday, March 25, there was the meeting 
 scheduled to the Ministry of Companies and Made in Italy on the ex -dispute 
 Fiat Termini Imerese (ex blutec) over 12 long (with definitive closure long 
 wanted by Marchionne on December 31, 2011).
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  <span>
   As you know, after the failure of the former Blutec, they were made 
 Several calls for the relaunch of the industrial area, all of which have been emptied. Yesterday, 
 However, the extraordinary commissioners found in the Pelligra Holding group 
 Italy s.r.l. The "successful tenderer" of the last announcement. Ross Pelligra is 
 an Italian-Australian master, already known in Sicily for buying the 
 Catania Calcio. What does Pelligra Holding deal with? of constructions e 
 building renovations. What does it have to do with industrial production? Nothing!
  </span>
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  <span>
   But this seemed to be a secondary fact to the ministry: in the
Pelligra should (when he finally takes possession of the area,
at the end of the procedure provided for in the call) "reclaim and equip the area
In order to allow the establishment of production activities in the area, some of the
which will be directly linked to port activity" (from Il Sole 24 Ore),
in short, to restore all the old buildings of the plant and make them a
"
  </span>
  <b>
   <span>
    new park 
 industrial
   </span>
  </b>
  <span>
   " ready, that is, in turn to be entrusted to other companies that
they should produce something...
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  <span>
   And who puts in the money? There is a "Program Agreement worth 105 million" and
then "
  </span>
  <span>
   Available 
 There are also 70 million euros allocated by the last government financial 
 Musumeci ... ", in short, the Sicily Region which in addition, through the Department of 
 Work, for "passive and active policies" has 30 million available!
  </span>
  <span>
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  <span>
   Clearly, this project has been peppered with big words about construction
of the Termini Imerese Freight Village "which will make it possible to combine different ways of
transport (road, rail, sea) and be the centre of gravity of a large area of
production (which) will make the area active and attractive again for new
productive investments."
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  <span>
   And the workers? This building renovation project provides for “hiring 
 of 350 employees, currently in layoffs, with guarantee of employment 
 for the next 24 months. "
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  <span>
   350 are
  </span>
  556 for two years! And then?
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
  </span>
  They could also return to the “Company 
 of purpose ”and be ... accompanied to retirement.
  <span>

 <p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  While “for the 180 workers who 
 they would remain outside the perimeter of the hires (another 40 can retire 
 immediately) the hypotheses are different: the first concerns the recognition of the work 
 used and on this Minister Calderone would have shown availability to 
 go into detail; The second includes a period of another two years of Naspi at 
 expire of the CIG and then be accompanied to retirement; The third provides 
 the establishment of a newly public purpose of the purpose that could 
 Absorbing workers still in charge of Blutec. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  This meeting “chaired by 
 Ministers Adolfo Urso and Marina Elvira Calderone ... with the Undersecretary to 
 Mimit, Fausta Bergamotto, the extraordinary commissioners of the Giuseppe company 
 Glorious, Fabrizio Grasso and Andrea Bucarelli, the Sicilian region, the Municipality 
 of Termini Imerese, the port system authority of the western Sicily sea of Sicily 
 and the representatives of the trade union organizations ”has served substantially 
 To find a way to definitively resolve the issue of workers 
 of the former Fiat, retiring them in one way or another! And of course it can 
 be considered a great commercial in view of the elections 
 European. And in fact also the current president of the Region wanted to say the 
 his greeting the "industrial plan".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  And the confederal unions? They remember 
 that there are still 200 of the survey for which nothing has been decided and express, 
 As always, some "perplexities", given the "complexity" of the question, but in the 
 substance I agree, suffice the declaration of those of the Fiom-Cgil: “Project 
 of reindustrialisation, retirements and purposes are three elements 
 essential to give a solution to all workers ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  No, just no. The workers in 
 layoff for 12 years, seasoned with promises and no ending chatter 
 On the "next reindustrialisation" and loss of salary, they did not have 
 No "solution" if not the one to lose ...
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  However, since the steps 
 provided for the implementation of these agreements should be concluded 
 by 4 November next, the date of the definitive expiry of all 
 social safety nets, the workers have time to analyze and reason 
 on the proposal and make their decisions!
