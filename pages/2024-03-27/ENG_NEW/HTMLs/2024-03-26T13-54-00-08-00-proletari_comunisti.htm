  - Of course in his own way, through the pen of such Maurizio 
 Ferrini - of what happened during the same day in some 
 Italian squares affected by parades for Palestine; The Pennivendolo - 
  which evidently is permanently equipped with paralters - 
 argues that during the Rome event they heard "insults 
 to the life senator Liliana Segre, to David Parenzo and to the government from 
 part of the left and pro-Palestinian militants during the procession 
 Pro Palestine ».

  To demonstrate what he asserts transcribes some passages of the 
 Interventions at the parade: “We have further proof of the immortal 
 Victimism by our dear life senator Liliana Segre -

 Trucidati ". Insults also to the journalist

  , defined one of the "cornerstones of Zionism Made in Italy".

 <p>
  We ask, to anyone who is not permanently equipped with 
 blinders, to explain to us - after analyzing without preconceptions how much 
 just repeated - what the insults would be addressed to the nonagenaria 
 Milanese senator; We cannot see any: unless not than 
 we mean the accusations of not wanting to see another holocaust if not

 Second World War by the Hitler's hordes with the help of 
 Mussolinian fascists, collaborators and spies ready to denounce the 
 Reprobes for some personal gain.
