 <p>
  On March 24, the Remís Carla Women Group held a meeting with the residents of the Popular Condominium Esplanada celebrating March 8 (International Proletarian Women's Day). At the time, they denounced the neglect of years and years by the City of Guarulhos and previous administrations to maintain the place. After a storm in December 2023, blocks 6 and 13 were harshly affected by detachment and are suffering serious structural and sanitary risks. Residents also deal with lack of light and severe infiltration in the apartments.
 </p>
 <p>
  The meeting debated the origin of the date, female oppression, and, within this, domestic work and class character of the “Women's Day”, truly international day of proletarian women, pointing out the differences between the conditions of exploiting women and those working women. There was also the popular struggle as a mandatory way to achieve their liberation.

  The residents of the Esplanada Condominium, in the neighborhood of Pimentas, took advantage of the event to bring punctual problems that afflict them and their families. The locality developed from 2012 with the relocation of people from other outskirts of the municipality, such as São João and Vila Any, and never received due maintenance. “They played us like an animal,” denounced a woman.
 </p>
 <p>
  Size is the neglect that the documents of possession of the apartments were only made available last year and under the collection of R $ 155. Residents report coexistence problems caused by drugs and lack of leisure, as well as failures in the supply of water, energy, energy, and gas. It's been months that the blocks have been without light.

  In the project promised by then mayor Elói Pietá (PT at the time), it was guaranteed that the condominium fee would not be charged, which did not remain over time. Many residents boycott the collection in protest against the misuse of money. Most previous liquidators have committed screaming cases of corruption, such as selling apartments, stealing from cash, not reporting spending, and missing the payment of cleaning, maintenance, and concierge. For this reason, there are processes in the name of the condominium that total more than R $ 200 thousand.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a storm caused blocks 6 and 13, the last liquidator prohibited a report to report it, claiming that it was necessary not to give a breach to talk about labor proceedings. She also worked in the neighboring private condominium called Dunas, is related to a police officer, and barred the activities of the Popular Solidarity Student Committee (CESP), promoted by students of the Public College in front (Unifesp). The workers cherish the health and safety of the owners, stating “What if anyone dies? Will it import the process?

  In Guarulhos visited the house of one of the residents, which has suffered with severe effects of the infiltration that shakes its block. The walls are taken by the mold and moist to the touch, while the new gateway has been swollen and a metal piece on the stop causes electric shock on the routing. Several points of the ceiling have leaks fed by the puddles on the terrace. City agents have installed a canvas that cannot prevent their formation and feeds the proliferation of mosquitoes.
