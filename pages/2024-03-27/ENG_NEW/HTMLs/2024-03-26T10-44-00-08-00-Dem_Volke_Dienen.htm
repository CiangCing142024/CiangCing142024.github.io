  Once again, construction workers have had serious accidents in the Port of Hamburg. On Friday morning, the murder by work took place on a company premises of the German parcel and letter express service DHL.

  Such murders of workers are unfortunately ubiquitous up and down the country. At Phantasialand in Brühl near Cologne, one of the largest amusement parks in Europe, an employee of the technical department was hit by a roller coaster during maintenance work on Monday and seriously injured in the head. The worker died a short time later at the scene of the accident. The murdered man was 43 years old.

  A worker was killed last Tuesday morning during construction work in Burghausen (Altötting district) in Upper Bavaria. The man was engaged in dredging work at around 7:15 a.m. on a factory site in Burgkirchener Straße. In the process, an excavator bit came loose from a 30-ton excavator, which hit the 57-year-old worker.

  Also last week, a technical worker from Upper Bavaria was killed in a train accident at a construction site of the Brenner Base Tunnel. The 57-year-old was engaged in surveying work in a construction phase in the Innsbruck area. At the same time, a transport train drove into the main tunnel and hit the man. An alerted emergency doctor could only determine death.

   the number of deaths from work has remained constant over the past decade. Despite the sometimes very sensational cases, there is no improvement at all

  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   working conditions
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   . More than 400 workers die every year because they have to sell their workforce under adverse circumstances. On average, more than one worker in Germany dies per day through a so -called work “accident”.
  </span>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">
   Such accidents always have the same cause: stress and hustle and bustle caused by the job buyers and a lack of occupational safety measures. Accordingly, such accidents cannot be characterized in any other way than murder.
