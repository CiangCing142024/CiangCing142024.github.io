   What is happening to the steel mills of Italy.
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ...The 
  new decree that the government has made with the aim of satisfying the 
 small and medium masters of the contract that advance large credits from 
 Steel mills of Italy and at the same time ... extending the cashier 
 integration to all workers of the contract (also for whom, and are 
 many, has the CCNL Multiservizi) ... is unable to resolve the 
 problems of the future of workers.
  <br/>
  Moreover, workers do not 
 They want to be put in layoffs and then, if you resume 
 Steelworks would return to work (when and how everything is to be seen). 
  The workers want to work immediately! Without the resumption of work 
 There will be layoffs and redundancies.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   The government has decided the extraordinary administration with the support of confederal and USB trade union organizations.
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Also 
  The unions, as in the beginning the Segr, Naz. Palombella della Uilm, who 
 They said no to the AS, today they are all satisfied, because it was sent 
 away from the Mittal government and the notorious in Morselli. In fact confirming 
  Among the workers, the idea, already very propagated, that if he govern e 
 Management changed the problems of this factory are solved. It's a 
  Deep illusion. As if it is a manager who decides politics and not the 
  owners of the company as a whole, not the laws of capital, the 
 World Economic Crisis, the laws of governments, etc ...
  <br/>
  Now, it's good 
 know that the periods in which this company was of the state (since 1963 
  to 1995) they are much greater than the periods in which it was private individuals; 
 Then the crisis of the Riva Group, the "Educational Environment" investigation of 2012 
 He meant that this company, formally commissioned, was 
 managed by the State and its governments from 2012 to 2018; and, in all 
 These years have not been seen any kind of improvement or on the plane 
 of health and safety - actually key theme for this 
 factory - nor compared to the ordinary trend in terms of 
 exploitation, working conditions, rights, wages, use 
 Flexible for layoffs. Everything went the same ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   We consider the extraordinary administration a worse remedy for evil.
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Will bring 
  more permanent layoffs; There will be no return to the work of 
 workers of many companies
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 of the contract, and in some there will be layoffs 
  in the next future; Thousands of 
 Esuber, beyond the post -extraordinary administration solutions of the 
 Government, you will worsen the wage conditions/ 
 working/ contractual; and by environmentalization, reclamation, 
 Decarbonization, well that goes, years and years will pass ...
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There 
 factory today has as its main commissioner, Giancarlo Quaranta, who in 
  these years has been part of the previous management, of the period of 
 Riva, which was definitively sentenced for death in 2003 a 
 followed collapse of the arm of a crane of 2 workers (Paolo Franco e 
 Pasquale Ettorre), a very felt mortal accident that gave birth to the 
 Committee 12 June and to the network for safety; and another worker 
 In 2002, Marco Perrone in work training - first fatal accidents 
 of a new generation of workers ... on the great question of 
 environmental disaster caused by the factory is forty that in his 
 guise of director had said on the path paths - that nailed 
 The Ilva at his serious, enormous, responsibility for the emissions they have 
 Product pollution and death in the city and in the neighborhoods - that there is "a 
  Great question in the relationship between cause and effect ".
 <br/>
 Forty 
 has held several positions even after the seizure of the plants 
 of 2012, was promoted as central director of the operations of 
 Steel mills, a charge that he held for about a year. But then not 
 disappears, goes to the operational technical division, participates in all 
 subsequent events also as Commissioner Dellâ€™Alva in AS, after 
 Mittal's entry.
 <br/>
 So we have a thousand and a reason to say 
 that, both the choice of the extraordinary administration and the appointment of 
 this commissioner,
 <b>
  they represent not a change but a restoration. A restoration of Ilva at its worst.
 </b>
 <br/>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Then
 The government says the factory will be handed over to new owners, who will 
they will use the same logic as Mittal: do the maximum 
profit, cutting jobs and costs, first and foremost those exorbitant on 
effective safety and protection of health, and in all this to have 
hands-free...
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   ... who would be the new masters.
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  The world steel market has been in crisis of overproduction for a long time 
  time; a relative overproduction in the capitalist system because the 
 sale of the steel must carry out the profits for the masters, certainly not 
  because the need for steel does not grow in the world with many countries that 
  they need accelerated industrial development in which steel 
 plays a decisive role.
  <br/>
  And that's how, if you think Mittal, 
 As soon as he slowed down his commitment on Taranto he immediately 
 expanded in his country, in India, where there will be the largest 
 The world steel that will accompany the regime's rise dynamics 
 Indian.
  <br/>
  This crisis of the Taranto plant plays a 
 important function ... it 
 Taranto plant is strategically placed in a key point 
 towards the new markets that in perspective open in North Africa, in 
 Middle East. Possessing Taranto means having a ring 
 fundamental of the world chain of steel production.
  <br/>
  There 
  truth is that
  <b>
   The masters, in a phase like this, the plants there 
 they want "free",
  </b>
  that they are delivered to him at four money and in which 
 they can
  <b>
   have a free hand
  </b>
  in the type of production, in 
 exploitation of work-work, environmental issues and 
 judicial. However, this is the condition required today by all 
 Steel manufacturers in Italy, Europe, in the world.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, who 
  They would be the new investors. From the news it is known that one can be 
 there
  <b>
   Vulcan Green steel.
  </b>
  A multinational that is building a system 
  from 5 million tons of pre -labor and, as you know, the pre -launch is 
  one of the prospects for environmentalization, for the transformation 
 production of the Ilva of Taranto. The investment in Oman is two 
 billions of dollars. He is now looking for a steel mill to produce 
 steel. The owner is Naveen Jindal son of the Jindal. In Italy 
 Jindal was the rival of ArceloMittal to acquire Ilva, he lost 
  The race and poured on Piombino, doing damage.
  <br/>
  So 
 Vulcangreensteel is a 'by -product' by Jindal ...
  <br/>
  The Indians of this 
  group would like ILVA, but by putting maximum one and a half billion 
 of resources e
  <b>
   they think of a reduced Ilva with 5,000 employees in all,
  </b>
  then with a halving of the current working class of the 
 establishment and equally of the contract.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The other competitor, 
 This is very sponsored also for its national character from 
 Meloni government, but also by the Federacciai and on a substantial part 
 of the union, is
  <b>
   Arvedi ...
  </b>
  <br/>
  There 
  position of Arvedi has always been of willingness to intervene in 
 combination with the public partner, that is to say if the money puts the 
 Public shareholder and as long as there is Tabula Rasa compared to the previous. 
 That is, the same things that Arcelormittal asked. Moreover, his plan 
  It would only focus on electrosiderurgia, in Taranto yes 
 should build a new laminated and three electric ovens but this 
 It means that when it is fully operational in several years,
  <b>
   5,000 workers are enough,
  </b>
  Not how many are today in Taranto, with the consequent net 
 reduction of the survey ...
  <br/>
  Finally we come to the
  <b>
   group 
  Ukrainian metinvest
  </b>
  who is advancing as an interlocutor. Metinvest sees 
 Especially in Cornigliano the first interesting business. Metinvest is 
 owned by Ukrainian Oligorca Rinat Akhmetov. Ukraine, since times 
 not suspicious, well before the war broke out, is dominated by 
 an industrial-financial oligarchy, of the same nature as that 
 Russian, although on a smaller scale. The personal heritage of 
 Akhmetov is 5.7 billion dollars, with two centers of interest, the 
 Finance and steelmate. It appears on the list of the 500 richest men 
 of the world and has two purposes: the money and the need to acquire skills 
 Product.
  <br/>
  "The special operation" by Vladimir Putin has done 
 of his main steel tank in Ukraine, Azovstal of Mariupol, one 
 Zombiestan,
  <br/>
  Akhmetov noted Piombino. The Meloni government has 
 Taranto proposed to Akhmetov and there would be a liking of 
 Americans ... as Il Sole 24 Ore always says 'it is buying capacity' 
 productive 
  All over the world ', what he had done and continues to do Mittal. 
 Meetinvest, however - always according to this press - does not want to enter 
 Conflict with ArceloMittal, because it is clear that with the Ilva in the hands of 
 Others will be war among the steel multinationals. But the effects 
 Also this time they will be downloaded on the workers ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   ... the main problem is to affirm workers' autonomy.
  </b>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Affirm
 that the workers' struggle is autonomous in its objectives, in its forms of 
Struggle and organization. It is not in favor of a master rather than a 
other; its watchword must be: masters of state, masters of the 
the very exploitation of the proletariat. We think that only the 
Prolonged and general autonomous and unitary struggle of the workers Steelworks/
 contract/workers cigs in Ilva AS must and can defend the interests of
 working class on work, wages, working conditions, rights and
 safety; and that, therefore, another line and another line is needed 
union leadership to be built in the fire of struggle, and to be part of the 
of the strategic battle against this government and any government of the 
bosses, the state of capital and the system 
capitalist/imperialist, for a workers' government, a new state and 
A new power in the hands of the proletarians and popular masses.
  <br/>
  This is 
 important for organizing your self -defense initially, for 
 build in the struggle the strength necessary to overthrow the "table" of 
 This factory ...
 </p>
 <p>
  From the point of view of the workers of the Steel Mill and the Contract
  <b>
   In all these months of meetings in Rome, no workers' platform has been put on the table, no concrete demands
  </b>
  in defense of the workers: from the minimum, of the wage integration to the 
  Cassintegration (millions to the masters and not even hundreds of euros to 
 workers); at the resumption of work both in the contract and for all in 
 Steel mill; from the blocking of layoffs; to use in reclamation 
 industrial area of workers for more than 5 years in CIG in AS; to the 
 Single metalworking contract and permanent for everyone 
 in the contract; For 25 years they have been enough to retire, on returning to the 
 Work/asbestos law; to the reduction of working hours a 
 equality of payroll pay. Instead, from not having the blocking of 
 layoffs and redundancies have gone to no longer even have 
 word to treat the layoffs, to contain it, 
 regularize it against the repeated requests that came from Adi for 
  reasons for flexibility in factory management ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ... it will be 
  Once again to the workers to choose which side to be on: on the part of the 
  government, of future new masters who look a lot like the old people who, who 
 On the general level they will present "copy" plans to those of 
 ArceloMectal, on the side of confederal unions that have become a ring 
 of the collaborative and neocorporative structure that identifies in the 
 solutions for the masters the solution for workers, when the whole 
 history of this factory shows that this is the cause of 
 what happened; or the workers choose the reorganization of 
 File workers, starting from their class interests, from a vision 
 opposite on the future of the plant, which is then the future of the class 
 worker, first of all as a historical subject who may be the element 
 transformation of units between workers and popular masses in this 
 factory and not only in this factory, but in general ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ...There 
 Ex Ilva issue must remain the center of the attention of the workers, 
 of workers. And certainly not only in Taranto, even if in Taranto yes 
 He fights the main battle on the matter ...
  <br/>
  ... when the government, i 
  masters, they say that Ilva is strategic, we are completely 
 agree with the government. The only question is that "strategic" for us has 
 another value: it has an important value for the working class of 
 our country, for the proletariat; and everything that imports for the 
 working class and for the proletariat of our country, it imports 
 in the class struggle, in the conflict between masters and workers, in 
 conflict between government and workers, in the conflict between capital state 
  and workers, in the conflict between the way of production 
 capitalist/imperialistic and workers ...
 </p>
 <p>
  ... today as never before 
  Workers' autonomy is the only solution, the reconstruction of the strength 
 of workers as a strength against, not strength for, against the logic of 
 masters, government and unions that go in the direction of deepening the 
 Crisis, do not solve the problems of workers and popular masses ...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ...In 
  All this the Slai Cobas for the class union represents 
 the only alternative item and on this will be important, both at the level of 
 factories and cities both nationally and this alternative item 
 feel strong and clear and find all the necessary understanding from 
 part of the class and combative trade union movement and of all 
 workers who are directly or indirectly involved in 
  this story ....
