Two fascists were killed in the attack, including a mercenary officer. The NPA unit was able to withdraw safely.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThe armed action is a response to the relentless focused military operation that covers the mountains bordering Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur,\u201d according to the NPA-Agusan del Sur. It said military operations have disrupted the livelihood of the indigenous people and peasant masses since 2022.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Clusters of communities are militarized to allow the entry of illegal logging of large trees such as Magkuno, Lawaan, Yakal and others. The operations are supervised by retired officer Captain Aranas of the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the 3rd SFB.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, AFP focused military operations serve to protect large mines in the Caraga region (which includes Agusan del Sur province and Surigao del Sur province). The region contains two gold mines, one chromite mine, 18 nickel, one hydrometallurgical processing plant, and one gold processing plant. All mines are geared for export.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Source : https://philippinerevolution.nu/angbayan/npa-agusan-del-sur-harassment-operations-kill-2-3rd-sfb-troopers/\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n</div>", "source": "https://www.redspark.nu/en/peoples-war/from-ang-bayan-npa-kills-2-sfb-troopers-during-harassment-operations-in-agusan-del-sur-province/", "type": "article", "title": "From Ang Bayan: NPA Kills 2 SFB Troopers During Harassment Operations In Agusan del Sur Province - Redspark", "description": "Ang Bayan March 26, 2024 A unit of the New People\u2019s Army (NPA) in Agusan del Sur province recently reported", "modified time": "2024-03-26T13:42:25+00:00", "author": ["Alan Warsaw"], "categories": ["People's War", "Philippines"], "tags": ["AFP", "Agusan del Sur Province", "Ang Bayan", "Antifascism", "Armed Forces of the Philippines", "Barangay Mabuhay", "Caraga Region", "communist party of the philippines", "CPP", "CPP-NPA-NDF", "CPP-NPA-NDFP", "Fascism", "National Democratic Front of the Philippines", "NDFP", "new people's army", "NPA", "NPA-Agusan del Sur", "People's War", "Philippine Revolution", "Philippine Revolution Web Central", "philippines", "PPW", "PPW in the Philippines", "Prosperidad", "SFB", "Special Forces Battalion", "Surigao del Sur Province"], "source_name": "Redspark"}
