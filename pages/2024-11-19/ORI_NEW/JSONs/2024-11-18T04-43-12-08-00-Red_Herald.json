According to the residents, the cattle was brought into the camp by the goons in order to cause disturbances and destruction in the camp, and justify a new attack by the Bolsonarists against the peasant masses, under the pretext of \u2018removing the cattle\u2019 previously sent by them to the area.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <div class=\"wp-video\" style=\"width: 640px;\">\n    <!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->\n    <video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"360\" id=\"video-19160-1\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"640\">\n     <source src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/VID_114471104_193958_288.mp4?_=1\" type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n     <a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/VID_114471104_193958_288.mp4\">\n      https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/VID_114471104_193958_288.mp4\n     </a>\n    </video>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The peasants made the cattle retreat with their own forces, but then three cars of the company came to the encampment and lingered around the area to try to frighten the peasants.
