  A Nova Democracia (AND) reported a new and criminal attack against the peasants in Barro Branco, Pernambuco, who had resisted the attacks by the latifundium heroically and had made its “Invasão Zero” goons retreat.

  The Support Committee for the Struggle of the Occupiers of Barro Branco published a series of images showing several fires caused by unidentified criminals.

  It was quickly understood wherefrom this criminal attack came: it was carried out by the latifundium. Its gunmen “were seen around the plantations.” These gunmen are led by the big landlord company Agropecuária Mata Sul S.A. Their objective was to attack a prosperous and fundamental crop in the area: sugar cane. Other attacks they had carried out have been with poison, trying to expel peasants from their lands, but everything has been unsuccessful.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we have reported, the peasants of Barro Branco, led by the League of Poor Peasants (LCP), are fiercely resisting the attacks of the latifundium, supported by students and democratic intellectuals, for example in the Glorious Battle of Barro Branco on September 28. The harassment by the gunmen as well as by the old Brazilian State continues, but that has not prevented them from continuing their struggle and mobilization.

  This is the price to be paid by those who not only combat and resist, but also defeat the latifundium, make it retreat and its goons flee. But as the peasants report and AND reports on the gunmen: “They will not succeed in intimidating the occupiers of Barro Branco, who will struggle night and day to gain the lands that rightfully belong to them!”
