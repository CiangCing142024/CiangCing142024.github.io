He\nobtains 312 delegates (the majority is at 270) against Kamala Harris's 226,\nwith a resounding victory. Trump celebrated his victory with a party in West\nPalm Beach, Florida, where he appeared three hours before the final result.\nThere, he proclaimed: \u201cWe are going to fix everything that is wrong in this\ncountry.\u201d \u201cIt is time to leave behind the divisions of the last four years.\u201d\n(06 NOV 2024).\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Speaking of\nthe most general and common political consequences for reactionary governments\nof cyclical capitalist crises, most media agree that \u201cTrump has benefited from\nthe frustration of citizens after the sharp price increases of the last four\nyears and the increase in illegal immigration.\u201d\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   The part\nreferring to the economic crisis-fall and change of government, we underline\nit, because since the 20th century and more pronounced in these two decades of\nthe present, we observe this trend of replacement of reactionary governments\nswept away by the crisis by other reactionary governments. What does deserve to\nbe complemented when referring to the \u201cincrease in illegal immigration\u201d, saying\nthat Trump has benefited from having awakened the lowest xenophobic passions\namong voters, using it openly as one of the axes of his electoral campaign,\nwhile Kamala Harris has used a shameful xenophobic speech. African Americans,\nLatinos and other immigrants do not forget that Hamala Harris, as Attorney\nGeneral, was especially harsh against them with her \u201claw and order\u201d policy.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Trump has\nreached approximately 74,500,000 votes, a figure very similar to the one that\nled him to defeat against Biden in 2020 with 74,225,000. On the contrary, the\nDemocratic fall goes from the historical record of votes for a presidential\ncandidate in the history of the United States with 81,300,000 votes for Biden\nin 2020, to 70,800,000 for Harris, with a loss of 10 million votes in 4 years\nand which places them in the most crushing defeat since 1988 (losing in the\npopular vote, in the Electoral College, in the Senate and in the House of\nRepresentatives). Ten million voters who were key to expelling Trump from the\npresidency and who on this occasion, even aware of the possibility of his\nre-election, abstained from voting.\u201c\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   \u201eAs of\nNovember 6, with the recount process not yet fully completed, the votes counted\nrepresented 65% of the voting-age population in the US.

This is how\nthe development of the contradiction is expressed, in the midst of collusion\nand struggle, between both factions of the American big bourgeoisie on the\npolitical level. This has been seen, for example, in the last presidential\nperiods, as for example, in the problems for the approval of the budget, where\nonly after difficult and long compromises (negotiations), between both mafias,\nwas an agreement reached to end the forced suspension of the administration's\nactivities or to approve an \u201caid package,\u201d etc.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   For this\nreason, both factions of Yankee imperialism fought to resolve this\ncontradiction in their favor, through a greater centralization of power in the\nExecutive, applying a presidential absolutism. This centralization develops in\nhard collusion and struggle in the elections for the replacement of authorities\nsuch as those that have just passed, in the dispute and collusion between\nRepublicans and Democrats for the appointment of judges and prosecutors in\ncharge of applying the laws at the federal and state level, as well as for the\nappointment of positions in the bureaucracy, one of the pillars of the\nbourgeois State, the other and main one being the armed forces.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   As for the\ncontrol of the judicial apparatus, during the previous Trump administration,\nthe Democratic control over the Supreme Court was reversed through the\nappointment of \u201cconservative\u201d judges linked to the PR; now, at the last moment,\nbefore the transfer of powers to the new administration, the Democrats intend\nto reverse it by using their meager majority in the Senate to appoint judges\nwho respond to the orientation of the PD. In the high bureaucracy, the PD has\nmaintained greater control.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   So, in\nthese elections, the problem has been at stake, under what sign this greater\ncentralization of Power in the Executive was going to occur as part of the\nprocess of reactionarization of the imperialist bourgeois State. It has not\nbeen, therefore, between reactionary democracy or fascism.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   As a consequence,\nwith Trump's victory in the presidential elections and with the Republican\nmajority achieved by his party in both chambers, we will see an absolute\ncentralization of Power under the sign of the imperialist faction that this\nparty represents, ganged up by Donald Trump as president, who will subject the\njudiciary and the bureaucracy, the intelligence apparatus and the armed forces\nto greater control. The president centralizes the Executive, Legislative and\nJudicial branches in his hands. Which means one more step in the reactionary\nnature of the Yankee imperialist State, a bourgeois dictatorship led by the\nfinancial oligarchy, a reactionary democracy with increasing suppression and\nrestriction of rights and freedoms.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <b>\n    On the\nfurther decomposition of imperialism on all levels:\n   </b>\n  </span>\n </h2>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   In American\nsociety, in these reactionary elections, ideologically, it has been reflected,\non the one hand, in a rotten imperialist, reactionary, post-modernist and\nsocial-chauvinist thought represented by the \"democratic\" mafia,\nwhich focuses on the \"identity discourse\" to mobilize, in search of\nsocial and partisan support, the academic and technocratic petite bourgeoisie\nplus representatives of the upper cream of the minorities to seek on that basis\nto manipulate the broad masses of the population in the service of the old\norder and the imperialist war and, on the other hand, in a racist, chauvinist\n\"identity\" discourse, of \"original American values\", of\n\"Christian values \u200b\u200bof service of the woman to the man\", of the woman\nas a child-bearing machine for wage slavery and cannon fodder for imperialist\nwars, anti-abortion, that is, ultra-reactionary represented by the\n\"Republican\" mafiosi appealing to the lowest instincts of the masses\ndegraded to electoral cattle, with a pro-re-industrialization discourse that\nclashes violently with the most parasitic and most decomposing character of\nimperialism.

But how? James Wilson clarified that the\ndelegates are in Philadelphia \u201cby no other part of this plan are they more\nconfused than by the form of the election for the office of president.\u201d Wilson\nhad proposed at the Convention that the president be elected directly. But\nJames Madison had introduced that, \u201cBecause the right to vote is greater in the\nnorthern states than in the southern states, (\u2026) the latter, on the basis of\nthe negroes, cannot have any influence in the election.\u201d In plain text: In a\ndirect election, the northern states, where there are more qualified voters,\nwould also have more votes. Wilson\u2019s proposal was rejected by a majority of 12\nstates to one. Some delegates at the Convention were of the idea that Congress\nshould elect the president. This method, known as indirect election,\nfacilitates the participation of the people in the election and keeps at bay\n\u201cthe excesses of democracy\u201d; it filters the will of the many through the\njudgment of the few. The senate is elected indirectly, for example: senators\nare not elected by the people, but by the parliaments of the states (direct\nelection was introduced in 1913\u2026). But the indirect election of the president\nposes a problem: the election of the president through Congress collides with\nthe principle of the separation of powers.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Wilson put\nforward another idea. If the people cannot directly elect the president and\nneither can Congress, perhaps another body can fill the void. Wilson's second\nproposal was that the people should delegate to an electoral college of elected\ndelegates, an assembly of honourable men with the corresponding wealth and\nreputation, who should properly take over the election process. This compromise\nwas approved. But this compromise was made on the basis of another compromise:\non the basis of the proportion of slaves. The number of delegates to the male\nelectoral guild was not to be represented by the number of eligible voters in\neach state, but by the number of its representatives to the House of\nRepresentatives. The representation of a state to the male electoral guild was\ndetermined by the standard for parliamentary representation\u2014one congressional\nrepresentative for every 40,000 people, of which enslaved people counted as\nthree-fifths. The male electoral guild was a concession to the slaveholders,\nwhich was as much imbued with mathematical calculation as with political\ncalculation.\u201d (Jill Lepore, The TRUE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES)\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   The\nmanipulation of American voters by the two mafias that take turns in the\nAmerican government\n  </span>\n </h2>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Here is a\nhistorical testimony by HENRY KISSINGER in his text World Order, Reflections on\nthe Character of Nations and the Course of History, Digital edition: January\n2016, original 2014, who here acts as a prophet of the past, but which has the\nvalue of a confession of part and of a fulfilled \u201cprophecy\u201d:\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   \u201cUntil now,\nWestern history and psychology have treated truth as something independent of\npersonality and prior to the experience of the observer. But our era is on the\nverge of a change in the conception of the nature of truth. Almost all websites\ncontain some kind of personalization function based on a tracking of Internet\ncodes intended to establish the user's background and preferences. These\nmethods want to stimulate users to \u201cconsume more content\u201d [18] and, in doing\nso, be exposed to more advertising, which is what ultimately sustains the\nInternet economy. These subtle orientations\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   are in\nkeeping with a broader tendency to manipulate the traditional understanding of\nhuman choice. Products are ranked and prioritized to offer those that one would\n\u201clike\u201d and online news is presented as \u201cthe news that might interest you the\nmost.\u201d [19] Two different people who turn to the same search engine with the\nsame question do not necessarily receive the same answer. The concept of truth\nis relativized and individualized: it loses its universal character.\nInformation is presented as if it were free. In effect, the recipient pays for\nit by providing data that will be exploited by people he does not know, in ways\nthat will then shape the information offered to him.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Whatever\nthe utility of this approach in the realm of consumption, its effect on policy\ndecisions can be transformative. Difficult choices in political decisions are\nalways lonely. Where, in a world of ubiquitous social media, does the individual\nfind room to develop the strength to make decisions that, by definition, cannot\nbe based on consensus? The saying that prophets are not recognized in their own\ntime is true insofar as they operate beyond conventional conception: that is\nwhat makes them prophets. In our era, the technical time of prophets might have\ndisappeared. The search for transparency and connectivity in all aspects of\nexistence, by destroying privacy, inhibits the development of personalities\nwith the power to make solitary decisions.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   The\nAmerican elections, especially the presidential elections, represent another\naspect of this evolution. It has been argued that in 2012 the electoral\ncampaigns had files on tens of millions of potentially independent voters.\nExtracted from social networks, from open archives and from medical records,\nthese files offered a profile probably more precise than the person involved\ncould have made from memory. This allowed the campaigners to choose the most\nappropriate technology in each case: a personal visit from friends already\naffiliated (also found via the Internet), personalized letters (extracted from\nsocial networks) or group meetings.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Presidential\ncampaigns are about to transform into media competitions between internet\noperators. What were once substantive debates over the content of government activity\nwill be reduced to candidates becoming mouthpieces for a marketing effort\npursued by media whose intrusiveness would have been considered the stuff of\nscience fiction just a generation ago.

If the gap between the\nqualities required for election and the qualities essential to holding office\nbecomes too wide, that conceptual knowledge and historical sense that should be\npart of foreign policy could be lost, or the cultivation of these qualities\ncould take up so much time in a president's first term as to prevent him from\nfulfilling his role as leader of the United States.\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   Whoever\nwins the electoral farce, always with fraud on one side or the other, will\napply in essence the same strategic guidelines and objectives of Yankee\nimperialism to maintain its status as the sole hegemonic imperialist superpower\nand world counterrevolutionary gendarme, just as it has been with all the\npresidents of the United States to date, as one witness testifies thus:\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   <o:p>\n   </o:p>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">\n   \u201cThe twelve\npostwar presidents have passionately claimed the exceptional role of the United\nStates in the world.
