For over a century, Palestinians have opposed the \nongoing Zionist settler colonial project in Palestine. Since 1948, Palestinians \nhave endured an ongoing Nakba (catastrophe) of forced displacement, \nrefugeehood, and exile; the denial of their right to return to Palestine; \nand an ongoing process of domination, foreign occupation, annexation, \npopulation transfer, and settler colonisation. Throughout historic Palestine, \nPalestinians have been systematically fragmented, dispossessed of their \nland and property, and discriminated against in nearly every area of life. \nPalestinians have been arbitrarily deprived of their life, liberty, human \ndignity, freedom of movement and residence; their right to family life and \nfamily unification; their human rights to adequate housing, health, and \ntheir collective right to freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources, \ndenied their means of subsistence and the right to determine their political \nstatus and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development \u00a9 Anne Paq/Activestills\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ2as integral components of their inalienable right to self-determination.1\nPalestinian scholars have long understood that Zionist settler colonialism, \npremised on the removal and replacement of the indigenous Palestinian \npeople from the land, is an inherently racial project, which Palestinian \nscholar and diplomat Fayez Sayegh described, as early as 1965, as akin \nto apartheid.2 Such critiques of Israeli apartheid, notably by Palestinian \nscholars, have since been rooted in a rejection of Zionism as a form \nof racism and racial discrimination and as a tool of settler colonial \ndomination.3 Building on these critical contributions, the last two decades \nhave seen tireless activism, organising, and campaigning by Palestinians \nand allies around the world to challenge Israel\u2019s regime of occupation, \ncolonialism, and apartheid. This ongoing mobilisation, at the grassroots \nlevel and in human rights advocacy, have led to mounting recognition by \nstates, civil society, United Nations (UN) bodies and experts, scholars, and \npractitioners, that Israel has established an apartheid regime over the \nPalestinian people. Throughout two decades of advocacy in the national \nand international spheres, Palestinian human rights organisations have \nalso conducted extensive legal research to determine the applicability \nunder international law of the frameworks of apartheid and colonialism \nto the situation in Palestine.4\n1\u2003 Articles 1(1), 6(1), 9(1), 12(1), 17(1), and 23(1), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n(adopted 16 December 1966, entry into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171 (hereinafter \u2018ICCPR\u2019); \nArticles 1(1), 11(1), and 12(1), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \n(adopted 16 December 1966, entry into force 3 January 1976) 993 UNTS 3 (hereinafter \u2018ICESCR\u2019).\n2\u2003 Fayez Sayegh, Zionist Colonialism in Palestine (PLO Research Centre, 1965) 22 and 27 <http://www.\nfreedomarchives.org/Documents/Finder/DOC12_scans/12.zionist.colonialism.palestine.1965.pdf>.\n3\u2003 Noura Erakat, \u2018Beyond Discrimination: Apartheid is a Colonial Project and Zionism is a Form of Racism\u2019 \n(EJIL: Talk!, 5 July 2021) <https://www.ejiltalk.org/beyond-discrimination-apartheid-is-a-colonial-\nproject-and-zionism-is-a-form-of-racism/>.

We do so in order to bring forward the eliminatory and \npopulation transfer logic of Israel\u2019s apartheid system and its effort to displace \nand replace the indigenous Palestinian people on the land of Palestine.5 \nPalestinians have advocated for applying established decolonisation praxis \nin countering Israeli apartheid, recognising apartheid as a form of settler \ncolonialism rather than pursuing a notion of \u2018liberal equality\u2019 without \ndecolonisation.6 This view was endorsed in the first report of the UN Special \nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories \noccupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, who considered that a \u2018holistic \nexamination of the experience of the Palestinian people as a whole\u2019 through \nthe apartheid framework requires recognition of the illegality of the Israeli \noccupation and its settler colonial root causes.7 A decolonisation approach \nis central to the present report, which situates apartheid within the broader \ncontext of Zionist settler colonialism.\nWhile we are encouraged by the growing global recognition of Israeli \napartheid, we note that Zionist settler colonialism and its eliminatory and \npopulation transfer logic remain missing from recent analyses and reports \non apartheid by Israeli and international human rights organisations such \n5\u2003 Patrick Wolfe, \u2018Settler colonialism and the elimination of the native\u2019 (2006) 8(4) Journal of Genocide \nResearch 387; see also Patrick Wolfe,  Settler Colonialism and the Transformation of Anthropology:  \nThe Politics and Poetics of an Ethnographic Event (Cassell, 1999) 1.\n6\u2003 Lana Tatour, \u2018Why calling Israel an apartheid state is not enough\u2019 (Middle East Eye, 18 January \n2021) <https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-calling-israel-apartheid-state-not-enough>; \nSoheir Asaad and Rania Muhareb, \u2018Dismantle What?

Over \nthe past few years, many more organisations from Palestine and around the \nworld have joined the global campaign against Israeli apartheid and various \nefforts by the Coalition to seek international recognition of this reality.18\nCumulative efforts of Palestinian human rights organisations and civil \nsociety have contributed to a mounting international law recognition of the \napplicability of the apartheid analysis to the experience of the Palestinian \npeople as a whole. This has included advocacy before UN human rights \ntreaty bodies and with various other mechanisms, such as the Russell \nTribunal on Palestine, which concluded in 2011 that \u2018Israel\u2019s rule over the \nPalestinian people, wherever they reside, collectively amounts to a single \nintegrated regime of apartheid.\u201919 Previously, in 2009, a landmark study \npublished by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) of South Africa, \nwith the contribution of Palestinian human rights organisations Al-Haq and \nAdalah, concluded that the international law frameworks of occupation, \ncolonialism, and apartheid concurrently apply to Palestinians in the \noccupied Palestinian territory.20\nAt the UN, Al-Haq, BADIL, and other Palestinian and regional human \nrights organisations, engaged critically with the reviews of Israel by the \nUN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in 2007, \n18\u2003 See, for example, Al-Haq, Global Response to Israeli apartheid: A call to the UNGA from Palestinian \nand international Civil Society Organizations (22 September 2020) <https://www.alhaq.org/\nadvocacy/17305.html>; see also , Al-Haq, Palestinian Civil Society Calls on the UNGA to Take \nImmediate and Effective Action to End Israel\u2019s Apartheid Against Palestinians (21 September 2022) \n<https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/20624.html>.\n19\u2003 Russell Tribunal on Palestine, Executive summary of the \ufb01ndings of the third session of the RToP \n(7 November 2011) <http://www.russelltribunalonpalestine.com/en/sessions/south-africa/south-\nafrica-session-%E2%80%94-full-findings/cape-town-session-summary-of-findings>.\n20\u2003 HSRC Study 2009, 277-278; see also  Al-Haq, South African study finds that Israel is practicing \ncolonialism and apartheid in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (4 June 2009) <https://www.alhaq.\norg/advocacy/7207.html>.\n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ72012, and 2019.21 In its Concluding Observations following these reviews,22 \nCERD found that Israeli policies and practices are inconsistent with Article \n3 of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nRacial Discrimination (ICERD),23 of which Israel has been a state party since \n1979,24 and which stipulates that:\nStates Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and \napartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all \npractices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.25\nThe Coalition\u2019s current campaign and research for this report began \nin 2019,26 in the lead up to the review of Israel by CERD in December \n2019.

Accordingly, CERD called on Israel to:\nEradicate all forms of segregation between Jewish and non-Jewish \ncommunities and any such policies or practices which severely \nand disproportionately affect the Palestinian population in Israel \nproper and in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.30\nDrawing on the Coalition\u2019s submission to CERD, the present report \nsignificantly expands on the analysis presented in 2019 and builds on \nPalestinian civil society organisations\u2019 decades-long advocacy on the root \ncauses of Palestinian oppression. For over three years, the Coalition\u2019s joint \nadvocacy efforts, particularly in the UN system, have allowed for important \ndiscussions on Israeli apartheid to take place with key actors, including civil \nsociety, states, policymakers, and practitioners, enabling a shift in the to \ndate largely fragmented approach adopted with respect of the Palestinian \npeople. The Coalition\u2019s ongoing campaign has opened up a broader \ndiscussion on the need to address the root causes of Israel\u2019s widespread \nand systematic human rights violations, including the crime of apartheid \nagainst the Palestinian people.\nAs a result, the UN Human Rights Council witnessed increasing discussions \non Israeli apartheid between 2020 and 2022, including the recognition \nof Israeli apartheid by a growing number of states, such as South Africa \n27\u2003 CERD Report.\n28\u2003See , notably, Adalah, For first time, UN body criticizes Israel\u2019s policies of racial segregation against \nPalestinians in Israel and OPT \u2013 as a single entity (19 December 2019) <https://www.adalah.org/en/\ncontent/view/9873>.\n29\u2003References to \u2018inside the Green Line\u2019 or \u2018within the Green Line\u2019 are used throughout this report to \nidentify the remaining territory of historic Palestine, outside that of the occupied Palestinian territory.\n30\u2003 UN CERD, Concluding observations on the combined seventeenth to nineteenth reports of Israel, 12 \nDecember 2019, UN Doc CERD/C/ISR/CO/17-19, para 23.\n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ9and Namibia, and civil society organisations.31 Our Coalition welcomes \nsuch recognition and wishes to pay tribute to the peoples of South Africa \nand Namibia in their struggle against apartheid.

Its \nroots lie in the preceding decades of Zionist settler colonisation of Palestine \nfrom the 19th century onward.\nZionism emerged within the context of European imperial expansion in the \n19th century and was modelled on racial conceptions of human sciences \nand the nation-state. In its quest for territorial conquest, Zionism was \nfounded as a settler colonial movement whose ideological commitments \nwere inherently racial.40 Despite the ethnic diversity of Judaism\u2019s adherents \nthrough the millennia, the dual factors of European Christian persecution of \nJews41 and the rise of racial theories in the 19th century42 sought to attribute \nadherence to Judaism with a single, distinct racial group. In this historical \ncontext, the late 19th century Zionist movement embraced this view of \npersons of Jewish faith as a distinct \u2018race,\u2019 enshrining it in the charters of \nZionist institutions, including those of the World Zionist Organization (WZO) \nin 1897, the Jewish National Fund (JNF) in 1901, and the Jewish Agency (JA) \nestablished in 1921. These institutions apply this racialised distinction as a \nmatter of unique Jewish privilege and supremacy over all others, exercised \nthrough the exclusive entitlement to \u2018Jewish nationality,\u2019 which is superior \nto mere citizens in Israeli law and policy.\nIn 1947\u20131948, the start of the Nakba launched by Zionist militias became \ninstrumental in the consolidation of Zionist settler colonial domination over \nthe Palestinian people and since 1967 of the territory of historic Palestine in \nits entirety.

Seventy-four years on, continued \nexpulsions and dispossession of Palestinians from the Galilee in the north,43 \nto Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem, the southern Naqab region, and every other \npart of historic Palestine mean that the Nakba is far from over. The ongoing \nNakba is a continuous process of deprivation and exemplifies Zionism\u2019s \nsettler colonial logic of elimination and transfer of indigenous Palestinians \nfrom their land.44\n43\u2003 Khalil Nakhleh, \u2018The Two Galilees\u2019 (Association of Arab-American University Graduates, Occasional \nPaper No. 7, 1982).\n44\u2003 Patrick Wolfe, \u2018Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of the Native\u2019 (2006) 8(4) Journal of Genocide \nResearch 387.\n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ131.3   Establishing Israeli Apartheid\nIn 1948, the Zionist leadership erected a regime in the newly established \nState of Israel to \u2018legalise\u2019 and, thereby, legitimise the crimes committed by \nZionist militias against the Palestinian people before, during, and since the \nNakba. These laws, policies, and related measures laid the foundations of \nIsrael\u2019s apartheid regime, particularly in the domains of land and property \nrights, nationality, citizenship, and residency, and nearly every other aspect \nof Palestinian life. This was done by instituting a legal and institutional \nframework to \u2018obscure the issue of dispossession and refugees,\u201945 while also \nestablishing legal and structural inequalities between Zionist settlers and \nindigenous Palestinians.\nIsraeli laws, institutions, and policies dealing with nationality and land \ngovernance distinguish between the rights accorded to \u2018Jewish\u2019 and \u2018non-\nJewish\u2019 persons, reflecting the Zionist movement\u2019s racialist character. \nWithin this logic, preferential treatment is granted to Jewish persons based \non a constructed \u2018Jewish nationality\u2019 status, also referred to as \u2018Jewish \nrace or descent\u2019 in Zionist doctrine and policy.46 The resulting strategy has \ncombined adopting laws to provide legal cover to the dispossession of \nindigenous Palestinians, while facilitating further annexationist land grabs \nto create a comprehensive system to appropriate Palestinian land and force \nPalestinian expulsion therefrom. This brand of Israeli apartheid enables and \nsustains the continued displacement, dispossession, discrimination, and \ndomination of Palestinians.\nA key policy in the establishment of Israeli apartheid is what Richard Falk \nand Virginia Tilley identified in their cornerstone 2017 report for the UN \nEconomic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), as the \u2018strategic \nfragmentation\u2019 of the Palestinian people.

Through this manoeuvre, the Israeli regime \nemploys policies of visible segregation and material discrimination against \nPalestinians in the exercise of their individual and collective rights. These \nunderlying policies seek to dominate and oppress the Palestinian people. \nSpatial separation, isolation, suppression, and concentration of Palestinian \ncommunities, on either side of the Green Line, sustain the pattern of illegal \npopulation transfer and demographic manipulation inherent to the Zionist \nsettler colonial project.\nThe Israeli regime\u2019s tactics to maintain apartheid over Palestinians include \nthe policy of strategic fragmentation of the Palestinian people and the \ncommission of a broad range of inhuman(e) acts of apartheid, within \nthe meaning of the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Court (hereinafter \u2018Rome Statute\u2019).51 Key among \nthese, and integral to both Zionist settler colonialism and its implementation \nas Israeli apartheid, are the commission of the serious crime of population \ntransfer, involving: the systematic denial of the right of return of Palestinian \nrefugees and exiles; demographic manipulation; and illegal colonial \nsettlement construction and expansion. Within this context, the Israeli \nregime commits a series of inhuman(e) acts of apartheid against the \nPalestinian people, including, among others, arbitrary deprivation of life;52 \narbitrary detention;53 torture and other ill-treatment;54 denial of freedom \nof peaceful assembly;55 restrictions on the right to freedom of movement \nand residency,56 particularly severe in the case of the 15-year illegal closure \n51\u2003 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (adopted 17 July 1998, entry into force, 1 July 2002) \n2187 UNTS 3 (hereinafter \u2018Rome Statute\u2019).\n52\u2003 Article II(a)(i), Apartheid Convention; Article 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(b), Rome Statute.\n53\u2003 Article II(a)(iii), Apartheid Convention; Article 7(1)(e), Rome Statute.\n54\u2003 Article II(a)(ii), Apartheid Convention; Article 7(1)(f), Rome Statute.\n55\u2003 Article II(c), Apartheid Convention.\n56\u2003 Article II(c), Apartheid Convention.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ16and blockade of the Gaza Strip; denial of the right to the highest attainable \nstandard of health;57 the denial of the right to family life;58 expropriation of \nlanded property;59 and various forms of collective punishment.60\nConsistent with Article II(f) of the Apartheid Convention, the Israeli \nregime also persecutes individuals and organisations by depriving them \nof fundamental rights and freedoms because they oppose apartheid. \nThis includes the arbitrary designation, in October 2021, of six leading \nPalestinian human rights and civil society organisations, including members \nof the Coalition, as \u2018unlawful\u2019 and so-called \u2018terror organisations\u2019 in order \nto undermine their work.61 Such tactics of threatening, persecuting, and \ncriminalising Palestinian civil society have a long history both within the \nGreen Line62 and in the occupied Palestinian territory.63 These are intended \nto silence and intimidate anyone who seeks to challenge the Israeli settler \ncolonial apartheid regime.\nThe institutionalised oppression of the Palestinian people, through the \ncommission of inhuman(e) acts, entrenches and sustains the Zionist settler \n57\u2003 Article II(a)(ii), Apartheid Convention; Article 7(1)(k), Rome Statute.\n58\u2003 Articles II(c) and II(d), Apartheid Convention; Article 7(1)(k), Rome Statute.\n59\u2003 Article II(d), Apartheid Convention.\n60\u2003 Article II(c), Apartheid Convention; Article 7(1)(k), Rome Statute.\n61\u2003 See discussion in Rania Muhareb, Elizabeth Rghebi, Susan Power, and Pearce Clancy, Persecution \nof Palestinian Civil Society: Epistemic Violence, Silencing, and the Apartheid Framework  (Institute \nfor Palestine Studies, Current Issues in Depth Series, 2022) <https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/\nnode/1653268>.\n62\u2003 Shany Payes, \u2018Palestinian NGOs in Israel: A Campaign for Civic Equality in a Non-Civic State\u2019 (2003) \n8(1) Israel Studies 60-90; Shany Payes, Palestinian NGOs in Israel: The Politics of Civil Society (I.B. \nTaurus, 2005), <https://www.academia.edu/6474025/Palestinian_NGOs_in_Israel_The_Politics_of_\nCivil_Society>; Arik Rudnitzky, Arab Citizens of Israel Early in the Twenty-First Century (Institute for \nNational Security Studies, 2015).\n63\u2003 UN Committee on the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, Outraged over Israel\u2019s Designation \nof Six Civil Society Groups as Terrorists, Speakers Tell Palestinian Rights Committee Harassment \nagainst Human Rights Defenders Must End (7 December 2021) <https://www.un.org/press/en/2021/\ngapal1443.doc.htm>; Al-Marsad, Arab Human Rights Centre in Golan Heights, Al-Haq, Palestinian \nHuman Rights Organizations Council, ESCR-Net, International Network for Economic, Social and \nCultural Rights, Cornell Law School International Human Rights Clinic and Boston University Law \nSchool International Human Rights Clinic, Report on the Repression of Human Rights Defenders in \nIsrael the Occupied Territories of Palestine and the Golan  (January 2022) <https://www.alhaq.org/\ncached_uploads/download/2022/02/14/repression-of-human-rights-defenders-by-israel-special-\nrapporteurs-1644827668.pdf>. \n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ17colonisation of Palestine\u2019s natural and human resources. Key to this settler \ncolonial enterprise are Zionist parastatal institutions, which have imposed \nboth the \u2018race-based\u2019 notions of Jewish distinction and supremacy, as well \nas the correspondingly exclusive control of Palestine\u2019s natural resources.64 \nPrior to 1948, the JNF assumed the task of acquiring and administering \nland resources essential to the formation of a Zionist state. Other similarly \nchartered institutions were established to capture and administer the \nother resources of the country. Among these was the Histadrut (General \nFederation of Hebrew Labor), founded in 1920. It was Histadrut that founded \nHaganah, the Zionist terrorist group, also in 1920, that later became the \nIsraeli armed forces.65 David Ben-Gurion, Histadrut\u2019s first Secretary-General, \nbecame chairman of the JA in 1935 and the first Israeli Prime Minister in \n1948.

The long-prevailing \u2018conflict\u2019 paradigm has \nentrenched the fragmentation of the Palestinian people and international \ncomplicity in perpetuating Palestinian oppression. Describing the situation \nreductively as a \u2018conflict\u2019 between two parties that needs to be resolved \nby the parties is a misleading approach. Rather, the belligerent occupation \nis taking place in the context of ongoing Zionist settler colonisation and \napartheid, of which it operates as a tool.70 Failure by third states to \nrecognise this key distinction disregards applicable peremptory norms of \ngeneral international law and the purposes and principles enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations, including the cardinal prohibition of the use \nof force.71 It further disregards third-party responsibility to refrain from \nassisting in the maintenance of the unlawful situation and the positive duty \nof states to cooperate to bring it to an end.72\nThe dispossession, fragmentation, discrimination, persecution, and \ndomination of the Palestinian people, which practitioners and civil society \nare increasingly understanding as apartheid, is also not the result of \nincremental Israeli measures and tactical responses to purported \u2018security\u2019 \nchallenges,73 nor merely a consequence of the rightward shift in Israeli \npolitics.

We \nconcur with Noura Erakat and others who have insisted that \u2018Israel did not \nbecome a discriminatory regime but is de\ufb01ned by such discrimination.\u201974\nThe apartheid framework allows us to shift the international discourse on \nPalestine from one focused on a misleading \u2018conflict\u2019 or \u2018slippery-slope\u2019 \nparadigm to one centred on implementing the right of the Palestinian \npeople to self-determination. Applying the apartheid framework aims \nat overcoming Israel\u2019s foundationally-racist and settler colonial regime, \nincluding the machinery perpetrating the ongoing Nakba, prolonged Israeli \noccupation, and the blockade of the Gaza Strip. In this, we further concur \nwith the latest report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine, Francesca \nAlbanese, that a paradigm shift is needed to realise the inalienable rights of \nthe Palestinian people.75\nBuilding on the argument of Palestinian scholars such as Lana Tatour, \nwe consider that a \u2018liberal\u2019 approach to Israeli apartheid that does not \nrecognise settler colonialism, and thus the need for decolonisation, is wholly \ninsufficient.76 The approach recognising Israeli apartheid moves from a focus \non the symptoms of Israeli oppression to the root causes, including its roots \nin long-discredited racial theory.77 The apartheid framework defragments \nthe Palestinian people and allows for connecting the Palestinian struggle \nfor decolonisation with global struggles of other indigenous peoples against \nsettler colonialism and associated forms of structural and institutionalised \nracism and discrimination.\n74\u2003 Erakat, \u2018Beyond Discrimination\u2019 (emphasis in the original).\n75\u2003 UN General Assembly, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, UN Doc A/77/356, 21 September \n2022, para 70.\n76\u2003 Lana Tatour, \u2018Why calling Israel an apartheid state is not enough\u2019 (Middle East Eye, 18 January 2021) \n<https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-calling-israel-apartheid-state-not-enough>.\n77\u2003 See Ernest Beaglehole, Juan Comas, Luiz de Aguilar Costa Pinto, Franklin Frazier, Morris Ginsberg, \nHumayun Kabir, Claude L\u00e9vi Strauss and Ashley Montagu, The Race Question (UNESCO: 1950 and \nrevised versions in 1951 and 1967); UNESCO, Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice (1978) and \nDeclaration of Principles on Tolerance (1995).\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ20Additionally, the apartheid framework exposes the inadequacy of the \nmanner in which international law norms and UN mechanisms have been \ndeployed in Palestine to date, in particular the failure to prevent, bring an \nend to, redress, and remedy institutionalised human rights violations and \nother breaches of international law committed against Palestinians. The \npresent report advocates for adopting an integrated, comprehensive legal \nframework to end Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime, encompassing \nthe protections of international human rights law, international humanitarian \nlaw, and international criminal law, as a necessary first step to providing \nlegal protection to the entirety of the Palestinian people, regardless of their \ngeographical location or legal status. This comprehensive approach seeks \nto overcome decades of Israel\u2019s strategic fragmentation of the Palestinian \npeople and the UN\u2019s institutional shortcomings by examining the experience \nof the Palestinian people as a whole and challenging the racial domination \nand oppression at the heart of Israel\u2019s institutions, laws, policies, and \npractices since the Zionist movement began and at its apartheid core.\nThe comprehensive legal approach advocated for by this report seeks \nto overcome the inadequacy of the previous predominant focus on \ninternational humanitarian law in Palestine, often in isolation from other \nlegal frameworks. International humanitarian law has only been applied to \nthe situation in the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, comprising \nthe occupied Palestinian territory (Gaza Strip and West Bank, including the \neastern part of Jerusalem) and the occupied Syrian Golan. Thus, the same \ndiscriminatory Israeli practices on both sides of the Green Line have been \naddressed through different legal frameworks. This fragmentary approach \nhas averted focus away from the commonalities, in policy and practice, \nof human rights violations across administratively constructed domains \nof Israeli control. By remedying fragmentation, the apartheid framework \nallows for a reconsideration of these violations within one overarching legal \nframework. As Falk and Tilley astutely observed in their 2017 ESCWA report:\nThe international community has unwittingly collaborated with \n[Israeli fragmentation] by drawing a strict distinction between \nPalestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians in the occupied \nPalestinian territory, and treating Palestinians outside the country \nas \u201cthe refugee problem\u201d. The Israeli apartheid regime is built on \n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ21this geographic fragmentation, which has come to be accepted as \nnormative. The method of fragmentation serves also to obscure \nthis regime\u2019s very existence.78\nAt the international level, the apartheid framework allows for an \ninterrogation of the fragmented treatment of the \u2018Question of Palestine\u2019 \nwithin the UN system. The UN system has played a role in fragmenting the \nPalestinian people through the creation of various mechanisms sought to \nconsider segments of the Palestinian people rather than the root causes. \nIn 1949, the UN established the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA),79 which, for over seven decades, has \noffered vital service\u2014but no protection\u2014for Palestine refugees who have \nbeen forcibly expelled and exiled. UNRWA was not mandated to provide \ninternational assistance to Palestinians similarly displaced and dispossessed \ninside the Green Line at the hands of the Zionist movement. Moreover, the \neffective end of the UN Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP) in \n196480 left all Palestinians without protection. In 1967 and thereafter, the \nUN political bodies focused on the territories occupied by Israel during the \nwar and the segments of the Palestinian people in the West Bank, including \nthe eastern part of Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Eventually, the UN\u2019s \nlegal bodies, in particular, the human rights treaty bodies began to review \nIsrael\u2019s performance under international human rights treaties inside the \nGreen Line, while considering the treaties\u2019 application in the occupied \nPalestinian territory since 1967 as an addendum. From 1993 onward, the \nUN Commission on Human Rights and, later, the Human Rights Council \nmandated Special Rapporteurs to investigate, report, and advise on human \nrights issues only in the occupied Palestinian territory since 1967.81 Only \nthe General Assembly\u2019s Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \nof the Palestinian People (CEIRPP), established in 1975,82 is mandated to \n78\u2003 ESCWA Report, 37.\n79\u2003 UN General Assembly, Resolution 302, UN Doc A/RES/302 (IV), 8 December 1949, para 7.\n80\u2003 Michael R.

Yet, it has \nonly nominally sought to do so. Instead, the CEIRPP has largely restricted its \nreporting to political events and developments in the occupied Palestinian \nterritory since 1967. \nIn all their diversity, the Palestinian people have shared a unitary identity \nand culture over centuries. The Palestinian people possess global \nrecognition as holders of the inalienable right to self-determination, \nreaffirmed in countless UN General Assembly resolutions.83 Yet, the \ninstitutional arrangement within the UN system has acquiesced to and \nadministratively solidified the Palestinian people\u2019s spatial segregation \nand fragmentation by the Israeli regime. While the UN bears permanent \nresponsibility for the Question of Palestine until its resolution \u2018in all \nits aspects in a satisfactory manner in accordance with international \nlegitimacy,\u201984 the world organisation has yet to begin repairing its own \ndisarticulated approach and structural flaws that have contributed to the \ndenial of Palestinian self-determination, the right of return, and bringing \nan end to the unlawful situation created through Israel\u2019s settler colonial \napartheid regime and its associated international crimes.\nAs such, employing the apartheid framework helps bring into sharper \nfocus the illegality of the Israeli regime itself, not only of its constitutive \nelements. Meanwhile, the predominant focus on international \nhumanitarian law to date has presented clear in-built limitations given that \nthe laws of armed conflict do not outlaw occupation in and of itself. Nor \ndoes international humanitarian law, and the law of occupation, stipulate \nmeasures through which the Israeli occupation can be ended, despite \noffering important prohibitions of key features of the Israeli occupation, \nsuch as the construction of Israeli settlements, exploitation of Palestinian \nnatural resources, destruction of civilian property in the absence of military \nnecessity, and collective punishment.\n83\u2003 See Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories \noccupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, UN Doc A/77/356, 21 September 2022, para 25.\n84\u2003 A/RES/57/1067, 3 December 2002 and reaffirmed annually through Committee on the Exercise of \nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, A/RES/74/20, 8 December 2020.\n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ23Adopting the apartheid framework does not mean abandoning any \nstanding instruments and principles of international humanitarian law, \nnor rejecting its applicability to Palestine, as Palestinians at official, \nacademic, and civil society levels have reaffirmed since 1967.

According \nto Article III of the Apartheid Convention:\nInternational criminal responsibility shall apply, irrespective of \nthe motive involved, to individuals, members of organizations and \ninstitutions and representatives of the State, whether residing in \nthe territory of the State in which the acts are perpetrated or in \nsome other State, whenever they:\n(a) Commit, participate in, directly incite or conspire in the \ncommission of the acts mentioned in article II of the present \nConvention;\n(b) Directly abet, encourage or co-operate in the commission of \nthe crime of apartheid.\nThe Apartheid Convention provides in Article V that persons accused \nof committing the crime of apartheid may be tried in the courts of \nstates parties to the Convention or before an international tribunal. \nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over the crime of \napartheid under Article 7(1)(j) of the Rome Statute. The Court has opened \nan ongoing investigation88 into the Situation in Palestine, comprising the \nWest Bank, including the eastern part of Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. \nThe ICC\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor has previously acknowledged receiving \nallegations of apartheid in this context.89 The ongoing investigation by \nthe ICC therefore provides an important avenue for individual criminal \naccountability, notwithstanding the limitations of Court\u2019s personal, \n88\u2003 ICC Office of the Prosecutor, Statement of ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, respecting an \ninvestigation of the Situation in Palestine (3 March 2021) <https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-\nicc-prosecutor-fatou-bensouda-respecting-investigation-situation-palestine>.\n89\u2003 ICC Office of the Prosecutor, Report on Preliminary Examination Activities (4 December 2017) para \n63: \u2019in addition to allegations directly related to settlement activities, the Office has also received \ninformation regarding the purported establishment of an institutionalised regime of systematic \ndiscrimination that allegedly deprives Palestinians of a number of their fundamental human rights\u2019 \n<https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/report-preliminary-examination-activities-2017>.\n\n\nOverview\nAL-HAQ25temporal, and geographical jurisdiction in Palestine.90\nIn addition to international criminal law, apartheid is prohibited as a form \nof racial discrimination within general international law and international \nhuman rights law.91 Under international humanitarian law, apartheid is \nfurther prohibited as a grave breach.92 As a matter of customary international \nlaw binding on all states, apartheid and racial discrimination constitute \na serious breach of jus cogens (peremptory) norms of international \nlaw.93 The breach of the prohibition of apartheid therefore gives rise to \nan internationally wrongful act, triggering the responsibility of the state \nresponsible, Israel.

Thus, it clearly embraced territories under a colonial r\u00e9gime. Obviously, the sacred trust \ncontinued to apply to League of Nations mandated territories on which an international status had \nbeen conferred earlier. A further important stage in this development was the Declaration on the \nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples (General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) \nof 14 December 1960), which embraces all peoples and territories which \u201chave not yet attained \nindependence.\u201d Nor is it possible to leave out of account the political history of mandated territories \nin general.

A growing number of reports by civil society, \nscholarship, and statements by former and current state officials and \npolicymakers have brought renewed focus to the discriminatory nature of the \nZionist settler colonial project. For over two decades,108 Palestinian activists, \ncivil society, and organisers have been at the forefront of international \nadvocacy for the recognition of Israel\u2019s apartheid regime against the \nPalestinian people. Central to this effort has been an understanding of \napartheid as applying alongside the frameworks of occupation and (settler) \ncolonialism, rather than in isolation from them,109 and as targeting the \n108\u2003 See, for example, WCAR, NGO Forum Declaration (3 September 2001) paras 98-99 <https://www.\nhurights.or.jp/wcar/E/ngofinaldc.htm>.\n109\u2003 HSRC Study.\n\u00a9 Activestills\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ32Palestinian people as a whole, within the context of the ongoing Nakba.110\nSince 2019 in particular, this Palestinian-led Coalition of civil society \norganisations has led a joint international advocacy campaign for the \nrecognition and adoption of effective measures against Israel\u2019s apartheid \nregime over the Palestinian people. This campaign, and the present \nreport, build on decades of critical scholarship, activism, and advocacy by \nPalestinians and allies toward understanding the root causes of Palestinian \noppression. This report is also a continuation of decades of work by \nPalestinian organisations to advance accountability and international \njustice for the Palestinian people.\nWhile discussions on Israeli apartheid have become increasingly mainstream \nover the last three or more years, some aspects of Palestinians\u2019 decades-\nlong mobilisation against Israeli apartheid remain absent or insufficiently \naddressed in the current discourse. For some, apartheid has materialised \nonly recently due to what are perceived as increasingly repressive Israeli \ngovernment practices111 or the entrenchment of Israel\u2019s prolonged military \noccupation since 1967.112 What this approach misses is a more structural \nunderstanding of Israeli apartheid as an inevitable outcome of settler \ncolonialism in Palestine and the Zionist movement\u2019s policy to eliminate the \nindigenous Palestinian people through removal from the land. Our analysis, \nbuilding on the work of Palestinian scholars such as Fayez Sayegh, considers \nIsraeli apartheid as rooted in the domination of the Palestinian people through \nZionist settler colonialism.113 The starting point for this analysis is the Nakba \nof 1948 (and the context that led to it) and the Israeli regime\u2019s subsequent \ninstitutionalisation of discriminatory laws, policies, and practices, to oppress \n110\u2003 See discussion in: Rafeef Ziadah and Adam Hanieh, \u2018Collective Approaches to Activist Knowledge: \nExperiences of the New Anti-Apartheid Movement in Toronto\u2019 in Aziz Choudry and Dip Kapoor \n(eds), Learning from the Ground Up: Global Perspectives on Social Movements and Knowledge \nProduction (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010) 85.\n111\u2003 See, for example, The Times of Israel, \u2018Israeli author David Grossman says Israel\u2019s West Bank control \nhas become \u2018apartheid\u2019\u2019 (9 December 2021) <https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/\nisraeli-author-david-grossman-suggests-israels-occupation-has-become-apartheid/>. \n112\u2003 Michael Sfard, \u2018Yes, It\u2019s Israeli Apartheid.

We understand \nthe Israeli occupation since 1967 as an outcome of this regime, rather than \nthe starting point for the apartheid analysis. This is supported by Sayegh\u2019s \nearly scholarship on apartheid as a tool of colonialism.114\n2.1   Growing Recognition of Israeli Apartheid\nOver the last three years, Israeli and international human rights organisations \nhave issued reports concluding that Israeli authorities impose apartheid \nover the Palestinian people. In July 2020, the Israeli organisation Yesh Din \nissued its report titled The Occupation of the West Bank and the Crime of \nApartheid: Legal Opinion, which concluded that Israeli authorities commit \nthe crime of apartheid in the West Bank through its military occupation.115 \nIn January 2021, the Israeli human rights organisation B\u2019Tselem issued a \npolicy paper titled A Regime of Jewish Supremacy from the Jordan River to \nthe Mediterranean Sea: This is Apartheid. B\u2019Tselem\u2019s paper argued that the \nIsraeli regime imposes apartheid over Palestinians across historic Palestine, \nthat is inside the Green Line and in the occupied Palestinian territory.116 Both \nanalyses by Yesh Din and B\u2019Tselem avoided discussion of the Palestinian \npeople as a whole, in particular Palestinian refugees, dismissed the question \nof racial ideology and the role of Zionist institutions in establishing and \nentrenching apartheid, and therefore constituted what Tatour has referred \nto as a \u2018liberal equality\u2019 approach to Israeli apartheid.117 According to this \napproach, apartheid can be ended if the Israeli occupation comes to an \nend. Thus, the colonisation of Palestinian land by the Zionist movement \nfrom the late 19th century onward is legitimised, as is the dispossession of \nPalestinians and the denial of the right of return of Palestinian refugees \nsince the start of the Nakba.\n114\u2003 Sayegh, Zionist Colonialism in Palestine.\n115\u2003 Yesh Din, The Occupation of the West Bank and the Crime of Apartheid: Legal Opinion  (June 2020) \n<https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/files.yesh-din.org/Apartheid+2020/Apartheid+ENG.pdf>.\n116\u2003 B\u2019Tselem, A Regime of Jewish Supremacy from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea: This \nis Apartheid  (12 January 2021) <https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_\napartheid>.\n117\u2003 Lana Tatour, \u2018Why calling Israel an apartheid state is not enough\u2019 (Middle East Eye, 18 January 2021) \n<https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/why-calling-israel-apartheid-state-not-enough>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ34Shortly thereafter, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold \nCrossed: Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and Persecution  \nin April 2021. Human Rights Watch made an important contribution to \nthe discourse on Israeli apartheid advanced by Israeli organisations. Its \nreport concluded that Israeli authorities have pursued \u2018the objective of \nmaintaining Jewish Israeli control vis-\u00e0-vis Palestinians over demographics \nand land\u2019 on both sides of the Green Line and with regards to Palestinian \nrefugees denied their right of return.118 This broader analysis of Israeli \napartheid was further elaborated on by Amnesty International in February \n2022, which issued its significant and comprehensive report titled Israel\u2019s \nApartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime \nagainst Humanity. By analysing Israel\u2019s apartheid as a system of domination \nestablished since 1948, Amnesty International\u2019s report came close to \naddressing the structural drivers of Israeli apartheid, further recognising \nthat \u2018[t]he totality of the regime of laws, policies, and practices described \nin the report demonstrates that Israel has established and maintained\u2026 a \nsystem of apartheid\u2014wherever it has exercised control over Palestinians\u2019 \nlives.\u2019119 Yet, none of the reports by Israeli and international human rights \norganisations went so far as to consider Israeli apartheid within the context \nof colonialism, in particular settler colonialism, as Palestinians have.120\nThese recent reports and analyses on Israeli apartheid published by Israeli \nand international human rights organisations were preceded by over five \ndecades of scholarship, activism, advocacy, and grassroots mobilisation \nby Palestinians who have long understood Israeli apartheid within its \nZionist settler colonial context.121 Notably, in 2001, Palestinian civil society \ncampaigned for the recognition of Israeli apartheid at the World Conference \nagainst Racism in Durban. Subsequently, the Stop the Wall campaign began \nto use the apartheid framework in 2002, followed in 2004 by the Palestinian \n118\u2003 Human Rights Watch, A Threshold Crossed: Israeli Authorities and the Crimes of Apartheid and \nPersecution (27 April 2021) <https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-\nauthorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution>.\n119\u2003 Amnesty International, Israel\u2019s apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of domination and \ncrime against humanity  (1 February 2022) 266 <https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/\nmde15/5141/2022/en/>.\n120\u2003 See , for example, Muhareb, \u2018A state of apartheid.\u2019\n121\u2003 Sayegh, Zionist Colonialism in Palestine, 27.\n\n\nIntroduction\nAL-HAQ35Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), which \nhas since advocated for \u2018Palestinian freedom, justice and equality.\u2019122 During \nthis time, students around the world began to organise Israeli Apartheid \nWeeks on campuses to raise awareness and challenge Israel\u2019s regime of \nsettler colonialism, apartheid, and occupation.\nIn 2005, Palestinian civil society organisations issued a broad call for \nboycotts, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel until it complies \nwith international law and realises the rights of the Palestinian people as a \nwhole.123 The BDS Movement has since been at the forefront of Palestinian-\nled advocacy in building and mainstreaming the comprehensive analysis \nof Israel\u2019s regime of settler colonialism, apartheid, and occupation. The \nMovement has advanced and proposed effective forms of accountability \nfor grassroots organisers, movements, civil society, and parliaments to end \ncomplicity with the Israeli regime. It is thanks to this longstanding advocacy \nand campaigning that the apartheid analysis in Palestine has now gained \nrecognition among Israeli and international civil society. Notably, prior to \nthe 2009 HSRC study, the BDS Movement published a position paper titled \nUnited against Apartheid, Colonialism and Occupation: Dignity and Justice \nfor the Palestinian People.124 Endorsed by over 90 civil society organisations \nfrom Palestine and around the world, this position paper aimed at building \nbroad grassroots consensus around Israel\u2019s regime of oppression against \nthe indigenous Palestinian people as a whole, across historic Palestine and \nin exile. In doing so, the significant contributions of the BDS Movement \nhelped move Palestinian human rights advocacy beyond the confines of \nthe 1967 lines and toward a more comprehensive approach addressing the \nongoing Nakba.\nIn this report, the Coalition sets out its analysis of Israeli apartheid and \nprovides recommendations for effective measures to dismantle this regime. \nWe adopt a comprehensive approach to understanding Israel\u2019s apartheid as \n122\u2003 See BDS Movement, Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel <https://\nbdsmovement.net/pacbi>.\n123\u2003 BDS Movement, Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS <https://bdsmovement.net/call>.\n124\u2003 BDS Movement, United Against Apartheid, Colonialism and Occupation: Dignity & Justice for the \nPalestinian People (October 2008) <https://bdsmovement.net/files/English-BNC_Position_Paper-\nDurban_Review.pdf>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ36it targets the Palestinian people as a whole since 1948. This report comes at \na critical juncture as the Israeli regime continues to escalate its oppression \nof Palestinians. In May 2021, the Israeli occupying authorities\u2019 targeting of \nPalestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah was the trigger for the Unity Intifada, \nwhich saw Palestinians on both sides of the Green Line and in exile rise up \nagainst over a century of Zionist settler colonisation. In response, the Israeli \nregime attacked Palestinian worshippers at Al-Aqsa mosque and protestors \nand journalists in Jerusalem, bombarded Palestinians in the besieged \nGaza Strip, supported settler mob violence against Palestinians inside the \nGreen Line, and undertook an ongoing mass arbitrary detention campaign \nagainst Palestinians.125 Since then, the Israeli regime has further escalated \nextrajudicial executions, collective punishment, and an intensifying \ncampaign to silence, intimidate, and persecute Palestinians, including the \nwork of Palestinian civil society. In October 2021, the designation by the \nIsraeli Defence Minister of six leading Palestinian civil society organisations \nas so-called \u2018terror organisations\u2019 represented a further dangerous \nescalation,126 threatening the ability of the targeted organisations and \nof Palestinian civil society at large to continue their work in monitoring, \ndocumenting, and seeking international accountability for widespread and \nsystematic human rights violations, including suspected war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity.

Both definitions have been viewed by civil society and the former \nUN Special Rapporteur on Palestine, Michael Lynk, as complementary with \n\u2018reconcilable\u2019 differences.127 Applying the elements of the crime against \nhumanity of apartheid to Israeli policies and practices against Palestinians, \nthis report shows how the Israeli regime systematically privileges Jewish \nsettlers, in accordance with Zionist doctrine, while oppressing the indigenous \nPalestinian people. This report is not intended to provide a comprehensive \noverview of the broad range of human rights violations committed against \nPalestinians, which have been documented by Palestinian human rights \ngroups for several decades. Rather, the report lays out the applicability of \nthe apartheid framework to the experience of the Palestinian people as \na whole under Zionist settler colonialism and discusses the relationship \nbetween these two frameworks.\n127\u2003 UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in the \nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967, Michael Lynk, 21 March 2022, UN Doc A/HRC/49/87, \npara 35.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ\n\u00a9 Al-Haq Images Library\n38\n\n\nZionist Ideology and the Roots of Israeli Apartheid\nAL-HAQ39\n3Zionist Ideology and the Roots of Israeli \nApartheid\nSince its establishment in 1948, Israel has entrenched a system of \ndomination over the Palestinian people with the goal of engineering a \nJewish demographic majority through Zionist settlement, colonisation, and \nthe transfer of indigenous Palestinians from their lands. As prerequisites \nfor the creation of an exclusively Jewish state in Palestine, the Zionist \nmovement theorised and planned the forcible transfer of the indigenous \nPalestinian people and their dispossession. Through Israeli laws and policies, \nparticularly those pertaining to nationality, residency, land, and property \nrights, the Israeli regime has racialised and fragmented Palestinians as a tool \nof domination. These longstanding policies are rooted in Zionist ideology \nand doctrine, which constitute Israel\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00e9tat.128\n128\u2003 See  CERD Report, paras 1, 7, 13, 48.\u00a9 Al-Haq Images Library\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ403.1   Origins of Israeli Apartheid\nThe roots of Israeli apartheid lie in the preceding decades of Zionist settler \ncolonialisation. The late 19th century Zionist movement embraced the \nview of Jews as a distinct \u2018race,\u2019 enshrining it in the charters of Zionist \ninstitutions to create a national home for the Jews. The first and largest of \nthese institutions include the twin WZO/JA established in 1897 and 1921 \nrespectively and the JNF founded in 1901. These Zionist institutions have \noperated for over a century to serve exclusively persons of Jewish \u2018race \nor descent,\u2019 in pursuit of establishing a Zionist state that embodies and \npromotes a corresponding \u2018Jewish nationality.\u2019 This constructed civil status \nforms a pillar of the Israeli state ideology of racialised Jewish supremacy \nover all others and the requisite for their exclusionary enjoyment of human \nrights in Palestine.\nThe Zionist movement had sought recognition of its Zionist national \ninstitutions in public international law129 as a priority for the purpose of \nmeeting the criteria of eventual statehood within the law of nations.130 \nIn the absence of a distinct population/people and land/territory, also \nrecognised as essential to any modern state, these institutions and their \naffiliates became the proxy of the intended government, each chartered to \nserve only persons of \u2018Jewish race or [biological] descent\u2019 (emphasis added). \nThe JNF was\u2014and remains\u2014chartered with the purpose and primary \nobjective to acquire lands in Palestine131 exclusively for Jewish persons \nand to \u2018promote the interests of Jews in the prescribed region.\u2019132 These \nproto-state institutions uphold the theory and ideology equating Jews with \na distinct race and \u2018legal\u2019 notion of \u2018Jewish nationality,\u2019133 a constructed civil \nstatus \u2018racially\u2019 superior to mere \u2018citizens\u2019 in Israel.\n129\u2003 W Thomas Mallison and Sally V Mallison, The Palestine Question in International Law and World \nOrder (Longman, 1986).\n130\u2003 Article 1, Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States (adopted 26 December 1933, \nentry into force 26 December 1934) 165 LNTS 20 (hereinafter \u2018Montevideo Convention\u2019).\n131\u2003 Article 3(a), JNF Memorandum of Association (1901), and Article 3(i), JNF Memorandum of \nAssociation (1953).\n132\u2003 Ibid ., Article 3(g) and Article 3(vii), respectively.\n133\u2003 George Raphael Tamarin v.

The 1943 Statement of Principles of the \nAmerican Council for Judaism, of which Berger was the vice-president and \ndirector,139 rejected Zionist racism and segregation, stating:\nWe oppose the effort to establish a national Jewish state in \nPalestine or anywhere else\u2026 We dissent from all these related \ndoctrines that stress the racialism, the nationalism and the \ntheoretical homelessness of the Jews.

Instead, that context laid the necessary \nfoundations for apartheid to be institutionalised. For example, the 1913 \nNatives Land Act, enacted prior to 1948, accelerated settler colonisation \nin South Africa and the dispossession of Black South Africans, who \u2018could \nonly purchase land in Scheduled Native Areas,\u2019 which \u2018represented seven \npercent of the territory of South Africa\u2019 and allowed for the forcible removal \nof the indigenous people from their land.148 In Palestine, the Nakba was \ninstrumental in the institutionalisation of Zionist settler colonialism and \napartheid, aimed at denying Palestinian refugees and displaced persons \ntheir right of return, thereby entrenching their dispossession, Palestinian \nfragmentation, and domination.\n3.2.2   The Ongoing Nakba\nIn 1897, the First Zionist Congress held in Basel established the WZO and \nresolved to \u2018create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine secured by \npublic law.\u2019149 The British Mandate for Palestine (1922\u20131948) facilitated and \nprovided fertile ground for the creation of a Zionist settler colonial state \nin Palestine. Crystallising the alliance between Zionist colonialism and the \nBritish empire,150 the British Foreign Secretary at the time, Arthur Balfour, \nmade his infamous 1917 Declaration supporting the \u2018establishment in \nPalestine of a national home for the Jewish people.\u2019 The Balfour Declaration \nadded that the British government would \u2018use their best endeavours to \nfacilitate the achievement of this object.\u2019151 Thus, in 1920, the WZO\u2019s public \n146\u2003 John Dugard and John Reynolds, \u2018Apartheid, International Law, and the occupied Palestinian \nterritory\u2019 (2013) 24(3) European Journal of International Law 867, 872-873.\n147\u2003 Ibid .\n148\u2003 Tshepo Madlingozi, Mayibuye iAfrika?: disjunctive inclusions and black strivings for constitution \nand belonging in \u2019South Africa\u2019 (2018) (Thesis, Unpublished) 29-30 <https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/id/\neprint/40367/>.\n149\u2003 Central Zionist Archives <http://www.zionistarchives.org.il/en/datelist/Pages/Congress1.aspx>.\n150\u2003 Sayegh, Zionist Colonialism in Palestine, 11-19.\n151\u2003 The Balfour Declaration (2 November 1917) <https://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/\nguide/pages/the%20balfour%20declaration.aspx>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ44law status was recognised in Article 4 of the British Mandate for Palestine, \nwhich provided:\nAn appropriate Jewish agency shall be recognised as a public body  \nfor the purpose of advising and co-operating with the [British] \nAdministration of Palestine in such economic, social and other \nmatters as may affect the establishment of the Jewish national \nhome\u2026 The Zionist organisation, so long as its organisation and \nconstitution are in the opinion of the Mandatory appropriate, shall \nbe recognised as such agency...152\nThroughout the British mandate period, the Zionist movement in Palestine \ngrew stronger until it eventually became a \u2018shadow government\u2019 alongside \nthe British mandate authorities.153 In 1947, the British empire withdrew \nfrom Palestine and transferred the Question of Palestine to the UN. On \n29 November 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 (II) \nrecommending the partition of Palestine into an \u2018Arab\u2019 and a \u2018Jewish\u2019 state.154 \nAs had been recognised by the UN Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) \nin September 1947, the \u2018Jewish national home\u2019 project and the anomalous \nnature of the British Mandate for Palestine\u2014which was to \u2018facilitate Jewish \nimmigration\u2019 to Palestine155\u2014violated the principle of self-determination \nadhered to with respect of other Arab states whose sovereignty and \nindependence were attained.156\nThe UN partition resolution also disregarded the demographic reality on \nthe ground.

There was little correlation between \nthe areas allotted to the Jewish state and the demographic or \nland ownership situation on the ground. There was no central \nauthority to oversee the process, the British having abandoned \nship by 15 May 1948. And, of course, there was no agreed \nmechanism for implementation. Thus, what the UN [General \nAssembly] partition resolution basically did was to give the fully \nmobilized military forces of the Yishuv\u2026 an alibi to establish the \nnew Jewish state by force of arms under the guise of conforming \nto the international will.159\nIn this context, the Zionist leadership developed strategies to deal \nwith the indigenous Palestinian presence as a \u2018demographic problem.\u2019 \nOn 3 December 1947, Ben-Gurion warned of the need to deal with the \nunfavourable demographic reality in the country:\nThere are 40 [per cent] non-Jews in the area allocated to the \nJewish state.

Approximately 15,000 Palestinians were killed in over 70 \nmassacres throughout the war that continued until 1949.163\nOn 14 May 1948, Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of Israel on \n77 per cent of the land of historic Palestine, where only about 150,000 \nindigenous Palestinians remained, a quarter of them internally displaced.164 \nTo prevent Palestinian refugees and displaced persons from returning \nto their homes and ensure the consolidation of Zionist settler colonial \ndomination, Israeli forces imposed a military administration and extended \nmartial law over Palestinians inside the 1949 Armistice Agreements Line \n(the Green Line) for 19 years, lasting from 1948 until 1966.

These acts amounted to \nviolations of the laws and customs of war that had been recognised as \nconstituting customary international law by 1945.165 Notably, the 1907 \nHague Regulations prohibited wanton destruction of property without \nmilitary necessity166 and pillage,167 while deportation of civilian populations \nfor any purpose and \u2018persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds\u2019 \nin connection with the armed conflict were recognised in the 1945 Charter \nof the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg as crimes against \nhumanity.168 These norms were established prior to the Nakba and were \napplicable to the 1947\u20131949 war over Palestine. As Francesca Albanese and \nLex Takkenberg write in relation to the rights of Palestinian refugees, \u2018the \nlegal framework in force in 1948, if enforced, would have been sufficient to \neither prevent or to address Palestinian displacement and dispossession.\u2019169\nDespite this, impunity for suspected international crimes committed against \nPalestinians has prevailed and Palestinian refugees have been denied their \nright to return to their homes, lands, and properties since 1948.

Accordingly, the High Contracting Parties to \nthe Convention have an obligation, under Article 146, to \u2018provide effective \npenal sanctions for persons committing, or ordering to be committed\u2019 this \ngrave breach.

The \noccupation framework has allowed Palestinians to draw attention to \nthe illegality of Zionist settler colonial practices targeting the Palestinian \npeople, comprising population transfer, wilful killing, torture and other \ninhuman treatment, collective punishment, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, \nand other measures.188 These practices are also prohibited as a matter of \ninternational human rights law, as enshrined among others in the ICCPR,189 \nICESCR,190 and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).191 However, Israel, as the \nOccupying Power, did not ratify the majority of international human rights \nlaw treaties until 1991, with the exception of ICERD, which it ratified on 3 \nJanuary 1979. Thus, for several decades, including through the early work \nof Palestinian human rights organisations such as Al-Haq, founded in 1979, \nthe predominant legal framework used to analyse Israeli policies in the \noccupied Palestinian territory was that of international humanitarian law. \nThis framework was supplemented in the 1990s with that of international \nhuman rights law, which has since been used by legal practitioners and \nscholars in tandem with international humanitarian law in an effort to \nmaximise the legal protection of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.192\nThe concurrent applicability of international humanitarian law and \ninternational human rights law in the occupied Palestinian territory \n188\u2003 Articles 32, 33, 49, 78, and 147 Fourth Geneva Convention.\n189\u2003 Articles 6(1), 7, 9, 17(1), ICCPR (among other rights impacted by policies of collective punishment).\n190\u2003 Articles 10(1), 11(1), ICESCR (among other rights impacted by policies of collective punishment).\n191\u2003 Articles 1 and 2, Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment \nor Punishment (adopted 10 December 1984, entry into force 26 June 1987) 1465 UNTS 85 \n(hereinafter \u2018CAT\u2019).\n192\u2003 See discussion in Linda Bevis, The Applicability of International Human Rights Law to Occupied \nTerritories: The Case of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (Al-Haq, 2003) <https://www.alhaq.\norg/cached_uploads/download/alhaq_files/publications/The%20Applicability%20of_Human%20\nRights_Law_to_Occupied_Territories.pdf>.\n\n\nZionist Ideology and the Roots of Israeli Apartheid\nAL-HAQ53was recognised early on by the UN human rights treaty bodies,193 and \nsubsequently by the ICJ in 2004.194 Using both frameworks in a \ncomplementary fashion allows for certain gaps to be bridged in the \noccupation law framework. Notably, a structural challenge has been that \ninternational humanitarian law does not in itself outlaw situations of \nmilitary occupation. As a result, experts such as the former UN Special \nRapporteur on Palestine, Michael Lynk, have authoritatively analysed how, \nas a matter of international humanitarian law, the Israeli occupation has \nin fact \u2018crossed the red line into illegality\u2019 through its prolonged nature, \nits violation of the prohibition of annexation, and the Occupying Power\u2019s \nfailure to administer the occupied territory in \u2018good faith\u2019 and in the \u2018best \ninterests\u2019 of the occupied Palestinian population.195 More recently, the \nongoing UN Commission of Inquiry on Palestine has also concluded that \nthe Israeli occupation is illegal,196 while the General Assembly has since \nreferred the question of the (il)legality of the Israeli occupation to the ICJ \nfor an advisory opinion.197 This is relevant in light of the fact that Israeli \nmilitary laws and administration have, first from 1948 onward and then \nsince 1967, served as a tool for establishing and maintaining its apartheid \nregime over the Palestinian people.198\n193\u2003 See, notably, CERD, Concluding observations on the seventh, eighth and ninth periodic reports of \nIsrael, UN Doc CERD/C/304/Add.45, 30 March 1998, paras 4 and 10-12; Human Rights Committee, \nConcluding observations on the initial report of Israel, UN Doc CCPR/C/79/Add.93, 18 August 1998, \npara 10; CESCR, Concluding observations on the initial report of Israel, UN Doc E/C.12/1/Add.27, 4 \nDecember 1998, para 6; CRC Committee, Concluding observations on the initial report of Israel, UN \nDoc CRC/C/15/Add.195, 9 October 2002, para 2; CAT Committee, Report of the Committee against \nTorture (2002), UN Doc A/57/44, para 215.\n194\u2003 International Court of Justice, Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, ICJ Reports 2004, p 136, paras 109-112 (hereinafter \u2018Wall \nOpinion\u2019).\n195\u2003 UN General Assembly, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967, Michael Lynk, UN Doc A/72/43106, 23 October 2017, \nparas 44-62.\n196\u2003 UN General Assembly, Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on \nthe Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, UN Doc A/77/328, 14 \nSeptember 2022, para 75.\n197\u2003 UN General Assembly, Fourth Committee, Draft Resolution, 10 November 2022, UN Doc \nA/C.4/77/L.12/Rev.1, para 18.\n198\u2003 See discussion in Al-Haq, Entrenching and Maintaining an Apartheid Regime over the Palestinian \nPeople as a Whole: Joint Submission to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of \nHuman Rights in the Palestinian Territories Occupied Since 1967, Mr Michael Lynk (January 2022) \n<https://www.alhaq.org/cached_uploads/download/2022/01/20/final-draft-lynk-s-apartheid-\nsubmission-1-1642656045.pdf>.

Thus, the international community only recognises the territories \noccupied by Israel since 1967, that is the West Bank, including the eastern \npart of Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and the occupied Syrian Golan, as \noccupied.199 In turn, the international community neither recognises the \nterritory of historic Palestine that lies inside the Green Line as occupied \nnor has it recognised Palestinian collective rights therein, including to self-\ndetermination. Although belligerent occupation applies on the facts, when \nthe warring army has been subjugated and the occupying force establishes \nmilitary presence and substitution of governing authority, there are other \ncategories of occupation which do not need to meet these criteria and which \nmay be applicable inside the Green Line, for example, armistice occupation, \npost-debellatio occupation, or forcible peacetime occupations.200\nPart of the challenge in applying international humanitarian law as the \ndominant legal framework in Palestine is linked to the fragmentation of \nthe Palestinian people and of historic Palestine since the Nakba. This \nis due to the recognition the international community lends to Israel, \nwhile disregarding the state\u2019s establishment through the inadmissible \n\u2018acquisition of territory by war,\u2019201 the ongoing mass forcible transfer of \nPalestinians, and the denial of the right of return of Palestinian refugees, \ndisplaced persons, and involuntary exiles, contrary to international law.202 \nIn this context, the occupation framework has proved insufficient on its \nown in addressing the totality of the Palestinian collective experience \nof dispossession, displacement, refugeehood, and settler colonial \ndomination and persecution both inside the Green Line and in the \noccupied Palestinian territory.\n199\u2003 See  discussion in Muhareb and Clancy, \u2018Palestine and the Meaning of Domination.\u2019\n200\u2003 Adam Roberts, \u2018What is a Military Occupation\u2019 (1984) 55(1) British Yearbook of International Law \n249-305.\n201\u2003 UN Security Council, Resolution 242, 22 November 1967, UN Doc S/RES/242 (1967).\n202\u2003 Albanese and Takkenberg, Palestinian Refugees, 135-136 and 179-180 .\n\n\nZionist Ideology and the Roots of Israeli Apartheid\nAL-HAQ55This fragmented approach has only exacerbated the legal, political, and \ngeographical fragmentation that Palestinians face on the ground due to the \nnature of Zionist settler colonial domination. In fact, predominant reliance \non international humanitarian law in the context of Palestine means that \nsome of the same discriminatory Israeli policies and practices targeting \nPalestinians\u2019 indigenous presence on the land have been addressed through \ndifferent legal regimes, with at times absurd consequences. For example, \nthe international community has considered Israeli settlements in the \noccupied Palestinian territory illegal due to the unlawful displacement and \ndispossession of Palestinians from their lands and their replacement with \nIsraeli settlers. Yet, exclusive Zionist settlement, involving the displacement \nand dispossession of Palestinians inside the Green Line, has in turn been \nnormalised by the international community. Both are integral processes of \nZionist settler colonialism and form part of the same policy of displacement \nand replacement of the indigenous Palestinian people on the land.\nBy defying the fragmentation of the Palestinian people, the apartheid \nframework has the potential to draw attention to the continuity of \nsettler colonial domination across historic Palestine and vis-\u00e0-vis \nPalestinian refugees and exiles denied their right of return.203 Yet, to \ndate, the apartheid framework has also been used in ways that entrench \nPalestinian fragmentation rather than seek to overcome it, such as in \nYesh Din\u2019s examination of apartheid in the West Bank only, or in the \ndistinction the report by Human Rights Watch drew between the same  \nIsraeli policies targeting Palestinians based on which side of the Green \nLine they are committed on.204\nAdopting a comprehensive apartheid framework, as this report advances, \nallows for a consideration of the experience of the Palestinian people as \na whole under Zionist settler colonialism, regardless of their geographical \nlocation or the legal status imposed on them by the Israeli regime. The \napartheid analysis, which incorporates settler colonialism as the overarching \n203\u2003 See for example: Rinad Abdulla, \u2018Colonialism and Apartheid against Fragmented Palestinians: \nPutting the Pieces Back Together\u2019 (2016) 5(1) State Crime Journal 51.\n204\u2003 Rania Muhareb, \u2018Apartheid, the Green Line, and the Need to Overcome Palestinian Fragmentation\u2019 \n(EJIL: Talk!, 7 July 2021) <https://www.ejiltalk.org/apartheid-the-green-line-and-the-need-to-\novercome-palestinian-fragmentation/>. \n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ56framework, has therefore been advanced as a more comprehensive \nframework that takes into consideration the totality of the Palestinian \ncollective experience.205 This is not to say that adopting the apartheid \nframework means abandoning that of occupation law. On the contrary, \nPalestinian civil society has long advanced the apartheid framework \nalongside the frameworks of occupation and colonialism as a comprehensive \narticulation of the reality on the ground.206 This report applies the apartheid \nframework as a vehicle to overcoming the fragmentation of the Palestinian \npeople and that of international law as it has been predominantly applied to \nPalestine to date.

The \nGeneral Assembly adopted a series of resolutions designating apartheid \nas a crime against humanity211 and, in 1973, adopted the Apartheid \nConvention toward the suppression and punishment of this crime.212 In \n1976, against the backdrop of the South African apartheid regime\u2019s \nviolent suppression of the Soweto uprising,213 the Security Council finally \nrecognised apartheid as \u2018a crime against the conscience and dignity of \nmankind.\u2019214 In 1998, following the formal end of the apartheid regime \nin South Africa and Namibia, the crime against humanity of apartheid \nwas codified within the jurisdiction of the ICC.215\n209\u2003 Article 85(4)(c), Additional Protocol I.\n210\u2003 Articles 41(1) and 41(2), Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n211\u2003 UN General Assembly, Resolution 2074 (XX), 17 December 1965, UN Doc A/RES/2074 (XX), para 4; \nUN General Assembly, Resolution 2202A (XXI), 16 December 1966, UN Doc A/RES/2202A (XXI), para \n1; see also Paul Eden, \u2018The Role of the Rome Statute in the Criminalization of Apartheid\u2019 (2014) 12 \nJournal of International Criminal Justice 171, 174.\n212\u2003 UN General Assembly, Resolution 3068 (XXVIII), 30 November 1973, A/RES/3068(XXVIII).\n213\u2003 See, for example, South African History Online, \u2018The June 16 Soweto Youth Uprising\u2019 <https://www.\nsahistory.org.za/article/june-16-soweto-youth-uprising>.\n214\u2003 UN Security Council, Resolution 392, 19 June 1976, UN Doc S/RES/392 (1976), para 3.\n215\u2003 Article 7(1)(j), Rome Statute.\n\n\nConstructing Apartheid\nAL-HAQ594.1   The Prohibition of Apartheid\nThe prohibition of apartheid is rooted in the general prohibition of \nracial discrimination under public international law, notably enshrined \nin Articles 1(3) and 55 of the UN Charter.216 The prohibition can similarly be \nlocated within core instruments of international human rights law, including \nArticle 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,217 Articles 2(1) and \n26 of the ICCPR, Article 2(2) of the ICESCR,  and in other international human \nrights treaties ratified by Israel, which are applicable within territories under \nits jurisdiction and subject to its effective control, including the occupied \nPalestinian territory and the occupied Syrian Golan.\n4.1.1  ICERD\nOn 21 December 1965, the UN General Assembly adopted ICERD, which \nexpressly prohibits apartheid as a matter of international human rights law. \nAs held by the Convention\u2019s treaty body, CERD, in 2006, the prohibition \n\u2018was strongly influenced by the cruel, inhuman and degrading effects of \napartheid\u2019 in South Africa.218 In its Preamble, states parties to ICERD \nexpressed that they were:\nAlarmed by manifestations of racial discrimination still in evidence \nin some areas of the world and by governmental policies based \non racial superiority or hatred, such as policies of apartheid, \nsegregation or separation.219\nCritically, Article 3 of ICERD enshrined that:\nStates Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and \napartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all \n216\u2003 Articles 1(3) and 55, UN Charter; Max Du Plessis, \u2018International Criminal Law: The Crime of Apartheid \nRevisited Recent Cases\u2019 (2011) 24 South African Journal of Criminal Justice 417.\n217\u2003 Article 2, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 10 December 1948, UN Doc 217A (III) (hereinafter \n\u2018UDHR\u2019). \n218\u2003 CERD, Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on \nthe initial to third periodic reports of South Africa, 19 October 2006, UN Doc CERD/C/ZAF/CO/319, \npara 2.\n219\u2003 Preamble, ICERD.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ60practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.220\nWhile ICERD does not define apartheid, it prohibits this practice and imposes \nan obligation on all states parties to eradicate apartheid \u2018in territories \nunder their jurisdiction.\u2019 Accordingly, the Convention is applicable with \nrespect of Israeli laws, policies, and practices of racial discrimination, \nracial segregation, and apartheid on both sides of the Green Line. CERD \nhas repeatedly affirmed that the territories under Israel\u2019s jurisdiction \nand effective control, where the Convention applies, include not only the \nterritory inside the Green Line but also the territories occupied since 1967.221\nAt the same time, the prohibition of apartheid under ICERD, and the \nobligation to eradicate this practice, is applicable with respect not only of \nPalestinians living in historic Palestine, but also to those Palestinians in exile \ndenied their right of return. States have an obligation under Article 5 of \nICERD to ensure that \u2018[a]ll\u2026 refugees and displaced persons have the right \nto freely return to their homes of origin under conditions of safety\u2019222 and \nthat \u2018[a]ll such refugees and displaced persons have, after their return to \ntheir homes of origin, the right to have restored to them property of which \nthey were deprived in the course of the conflict and to be compensated \nappropriately for any such property that cannot be restored to them.\u2019223 \nThis is relevant in the Palestinian context in view of the Israeli Law of Return \n(1950), which grants \u2018Every Jew\u2026 the right to come to this country\u2019224 and \nto settle therein, while excluding Palestinians, notably Palestinian refugees \nand exiles, from exercising their right of return.

As of November 2022, the Apartheid Convention counts 110 states \nparties.240\nWhile the reference to policies of apartheid \u2018as practised in southern Africa\u2019 \nhas led some to question the applicability of the Convention to other \ncontexts, international treaties are not generally adopted with a specific \ncontext in mind.241 Notwithstanding the reference to apartheid in southern \nAfrica, the criminalisation of apartheid in the Apartheid Convention \nis intended to be universal in scope.242 Such a view is supported by the \npractice of CERD, which observed in its General Recommendation XIX of \n1995 on the prevention, prohibition, and eradication of racial segregation \nand apartheid that:\nThe reference to apartheid [in Article 3 of ICERD] may have been \ndirected exclusively to South Africa, but the article as adopted \nprohibits all forms of racial segregation in all countries.243\nSimilarly, the International Law Commission (ILC) considers the prohibition \nof apartheid to constitute a jus cogens norm of customary international \n238\u2003 Carola Lingaas, \u2018The Crime against Humanity of Apartheid in a Post-Apartheid World\u2019 (2015) 2 Oslo \nLaw Review 86, 88-89.\n239\u2003 SA News, \u2018Cabinet approves UN ICERD periodic report\u2019 (26 February 2021) <https://www.sanews.\ngov.za/south-africa/cabinet-approves-un-icerd-periodic-report>; SA News, \u2018National Assembly \napproves four Bills\u2019 (8 September 2022) <https://www.sanews.gov.za/south-africa/national-\nassembly-approves-four-bills/>.\n240\u2003 UNTC, International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid \n(30 November 1973) <https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=IV-\n7&chapter=4&clang=_en>.\n241\u2003 Adriaan Barnard, \u2018Slegs Suid Afrikaners,\u2019 358.\n242\u2003 On the evolution of the crime of apartheid see ibid. ; Du Plessis, \u2018International Criminal Law: The \nCrime of Apartheid\u2019; Alexander Zahar, \u2018Apartheid as an International Crime\u2019 in Antonio Cassese \n(ed), The Oxford Companion to International Criminal Justice  (Oxford University Press 2009); \nRonald C Slye, \u2018Apartheid as a Crime against Humanity: A Submission to the South African Truth \nand Reconciliation Commission\u2019 (1998) 20 Michigan Journal of International Law 267.\n243\u2003 CERD, General Recommendation 19, The prevention, prohibition and eradication of racial \nsegregation and apartheid (1995), UN Doc A/50/18, at 140, para 1.\n\n\nConstructing Apartheid\nAL-HAQ65law, giving rise to obligations erga omnes.244 It can thus be concluded that \nthe prohibition of apartheid in international law, inclusive of international \nhuman rights law and international criminal law, was not limited to the \ncontext in South Africa and Namibia.\n4.1.3   The Rome Statute\nThe Rome Statute codifies apartheid as a crime against humanity entailing \nindividual criminal responsibility in Article 7(1)(j) and provides a definition \nof the crime in Article 7(2)(h), as involving:\nInhumane acts\u2026 committed in the context of an institutionalized \nregime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial \ngroup over any other racial group or groups and committed with \nthe intention of maintaining that regime.245\nLike the Apartheid Convention, the articulation of the crime of apartheid \nunder the Rome Statute focuses on the institutionalised, systematic, and \noppressive character of the regime. However, some crucial distinctions can \nbe observed. Firstly, the potential inhumane acts of apartheid enumerated \nin the Rome Statute are not as broad as the inhuman acts set out in the \nApartheid Convention, although there is some overlap. An obvious omission \nin the Rome Statute is the silencing and targeting of those individuals and \norganisations seeking to oppose the apartheid system.246\nSecondly, the apartheid definition in the Rome Statute is considerably more \nonerous in its contextual element. For inhumane acts to be prosecuted \nas apartheid by the ICC they must be \u2018committed in the context of an \ninstitutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination,\u2019 with \nthe added requirement that there be a specific intention to maintain that \nregime. This can be compared with the construction in the Apartheid \nConvention, which includes inhuman acts committed \u2018for the purpose of \nestablishing\u2019 racial domination, not simply acts committed after domination \n244\u2003 Dugard and Reynolds, \u2018Apartheid\u2019; Du Plessis, \u2018International Criminal Law: The Crime of Apartheid\u2019 \n417; ILC, Draft Articles on State Responsibility; Slye, \u2018Apartheid as a Crime against Humanity.\u2019\n245\u2003 Article 7(2)(h), Rome Statute.\n246\u2003 Article II(f), Apartheid Convention.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ66has been established. For the Apartheid Convention, all that is required is \nthat the intention behind the inhuman acts is to set about constructing a \nsystem of racial domination and oppression.\nAlthough the Rome Statute definition is considerably narrower than that \nfound in the Apartheid Convention,247 it must be stressed that this does \nnot result in a narrowing of the concept in general international law nor \nelsewhere in international criminal law.248 Like the Apartheid Convention, \nthe articulation of the crime of apartheid under the Rome Statute focuses \non the institutionalised, systematic, and oppressive character of the regime. \nIn any event, in the Palestinian context, as demonstrated below, it is clear \nthat an institutionalised regime of racial domination and oppression has \nalready existed for decades.\nTo date, no international or national court has ever prosecuted an individual \nfor the crime of apartheid. However, the ICC\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor has \npreviously acknowledged receipt of allegations of the commission of the \ncrime of apartheid in Palestine.249 The opening of the ICC\u2019s investigation \ninto the Situation in Palestine on 3 March 2021 and growing international \nrecognition of Israeli apartheid mean that the ongoing ICC investigation \nrepresents an important judicial avenue for the investigation and \nprosecution of the crime of apartheid in Palestine.250 The Coalition thus \nurges the ICC Prosecutor to investigate suspected perpetrators of the crime \nof apartheid, among other international crimes committed in Palestine, as \na first step toward challenging Israeli impunity.\n247\u2003 Noura Erakat and John Reynolds discuss this narrowing as part of \u2018[t]he ascendance of the liberal \nunderstanding of apartheid\u2019 in Noura Erakat and John Reynolds, \u2018Understanding Apartheid\u2019 (Jewish \nCurrents, 1 November 2022) <https://jewishcurrents.org/understanding-apartheid>.\n248\u2003 Jackson, \u2018The Definition of Apartheid,\u2019 854-844.\n249\u2003 ICC\u2019s Office of The Prosecutor, Report on Preliminary Examination Activities, 4 December 2017, para \n63 <https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=171204-rep-otp-PE>.\n250\u2003 See discussion in Noura Erakat and John Reynolds, \u2018We Charge Apartheid?

These two treaties have been ratified by the State of \nPalestine and are thus applicable in the occupied Palestinian territory. \nWhile Israel has not ratified either treaty, the internationally wrongful act \nof apartheid is prohibited as a principle of customary international law, \nand also exists as a jus cogens norm, and is thus applicable with respect to \nIsraeli laws, policies, and practices.\nThe Apartheid Convention\u2019s definition includes \u2018inhuman acts committed \nfor the purpose of establishing and maintaining domination by one racial \ngroup of persons over any other racial group of persons and systematically \noppressing them\u2019 thereby clarifying the necessity that the crime occurs \nwith the specific intention of creating and maintaining racial domination.251 \nLikewise, the Rome Statute defines the crime of apartheid as occurring \u2018in \nthe context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and \ndomination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and \ncommitted with the intention of maintaining that regime,\u2019 presupposing \nthat the regime in question is already in place.252\nTherefore, to meet the common threshold of the crime of apartheid \nspanning the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute, the following \nelements must exist: (1) inhuman or inhumane acts; (2) committed as part \nof an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination; \n(3) by one racial group over any other racial group or groups; (4) with the \nintention of maintaining that regime. This sub-section considers the four \nelements of the crime of apartheid as they relate to Israeli laws, policies, \nand practices committed against the Palestinian people.\n4.2.1  Inhuman and Inhumane Acts\nIt is important to note that under both the Apartheid Convention and \nthe Rome Statute, there is no requirement that all inhuman(e) acts must \n251\u2003 Article II, Apartheid Convention.\n252\u2003 Article 7(2)(h), Rome Statute.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ68be committed for the elements of the crime of apartheid to be fulfilled. \nAs the HSRC study found, the Apartheid Convention\u2019s list of inhuman \nacts \u2018is intended to be illustrative and inclusive, rather than exhaustive \nor exclusive.\u2019253 Accordingly, \u2018a determination that apartheid exists does \nnot require that all the listed acts are practiced: for example, Article 2(b) \nregarding the intended \u201cphysical destruction\u201d of a group did not apply \ngenerally to apartheid policy in South Africa.\u2019254 In the case of Palestine, the \nHSRC study concluded that numerous inhuman acts were satisfied, and that \n\u2018Israel appears clearly to be implementing and sustaining policies intended \nto maintain its domination over Palestinians in the [occupied Palestinian \nterritory] and to suppress opposition of any form to those policies.\u2019255\nWhile this report builds on the HSRC study, it extends the analysis to \nencompass the Palestinian people as a whole. In doing so, this report \nalso applies elements of the crime of apartheid as enshrined in the Rome \nStatute. Under the Rome Statute \u2018inhumane acts\u2019 of the crime of apartheid \nare listed under Articles 7(1)(a)-(k) of the Rome Statute as crimes against \nhumanity.

The framework of crimes against humanity requires that the \nunderlying acts be \u2018committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack \ndirected against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.\u2019274 \nThe ICC\u2019s Elements of Crimes clarify:\nThe last two elements for each crime against humanity describe \nthe context in which the conduct must take place. These \nelements clarify the requisite participation in and knowledge of \na widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. \nHowever, the last element should not be interpreted as requiring \nproof that the perpetrator had knowledge of all characteristics \nof the attack or the precise details of the plan or policy of the \nState or organization. In the case of an emerging widespread \nor systematic attack against a civilian population, the intent \nclause of the last element indicates that this mental element is \nsatisfied if the perpetrator intended to further such an attack.275\nWith reference to the crime of apartheid, the ICC\u2019s Elements of Crimes list \nthe following elements:\n1. The perpetrator committed an inhumane act against one or more \npersons.\n2.  Such act was an act referred to in article 7, paragraph 1, of the \n272\u2003 See PTC I, Decision on the \u201cProsecution\u2019s Request for a Ruling on Jurisdiction under Article 19(3) \nof the Statute\u201d (6 September 2018) ICC-RoC46(3)-01/18, para 77; Michael G Kearney, \u2018The Denial \nof the Right of Return as a Rome Statute Crime\u2019 (2020) 18(4) Journal of International Criminal \nJustice 985; see also  Clancy and Muhareb, \u2018Putting the International Criminal Court\u2019s Palestine \nInvestigation into Context.\u2019\n273\u2003 ICC, Elements of Crimes  (2011) 5.\n274\u2003 Article 7(1), Rome Statute.\n275\u2003 ICC, Elements of Crimes  (2011) 5.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ72Statute, or was an act of a character similar to any of those acts.\n3.  The perpetrator was aware of the factual circumstances that \nestablished the character of the act.\n4.  The conduct was committed in the context of an institutionalized \nregime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial \ngroup over any other racial group or groups.\n5.  The perpetrator intended to maintain such regime by that \nconduct.\n6.  The conduct was committed as part of a widespread or systematic \nattack directed against a civilian population.\n7.  The perpetrator knew that the conduct was part of or intended \nthe conduct to be part of a widespread or systematic attack \ndirected against a civilian population.276\nThe term \u2018regime,\u2019 although not defined in either the Apartheid Convention \nor Rome Statute, refers to an institutional structure or system of governance. \nLingaas writes: \u2018[a]n established law or practice by a government or \nprevailing order is most likely the closest to a definition of an institutionalised \nregime one gets.\u2019277 The finding of apartheid requires the existence of an \ninstitutionalised structure or system constitutive of a \u2018regime,\u2019 or in the \ncase of the Apartheid Convention, an attempt to establish such a structure.278 \nSections 5 and 6 of this report detail Israel\u2019s laws, policies, and practices \nestablishing and maintaining Zionist settler colonial domination over the \nPalestinian people as part of an institutionalised regime. These are asserted \nto be evidence of the existence of an institutionalised regime of domination \nand oppression constitutive of the crime of apartheid against Palestinians.\n276\u2003 ICC, Elements of Crimes  (2011), 12.\n277\u2003 Lingaas, \u2018The Crime against Humanity of Apartheid,\u2019 97-98.\n278\u2003 Miles Jackson, \u2018Expert Opinion on the Interplay between the Legal Regime Applicable to Belligerent \nOccupation and the Prohibition of Apartheid under International Law\u2019 (Diakonia , 23 March 2021), \nparas 24-25 <https://www.diakonia.se/ihl/news/israel-palestine-publication/expert-opinion-\noccupation-palestine-apartheid/>.\n\n\nConstructing Apartheid\nAL-HAQ734.2.3   Racial Groups\nRace has been described as a social construct,279 meaning that it emerges \nfrom the particular local context in which it is \u2018constructed.\u2019280 Article 1(1) of \nICERD adopts a wide definition of racial discrimination as:\nAny distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on \nrace, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has \nthe purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, \nenjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural \nor any other field of public life.281\nThus, Article 3 of ICERD prohibiting racial segregation and apartheid \nencompasses discrimination based on \u2018race, colour, descent, or national \nor ethnic origin.\u2019 The Apartheid Convention highlights this provision in its \nPreamble.282 In the specific context of international criminal law, general \npractice has been to eschew any attempt at identifying \u2018race\u2019 or other \nsuch outdated concepts in favour of the social construction approach.283 \nIt is therefore appropriate to adopt the same approach to the current \napartheid analysis.\nTherefore, the question is not whether Palestinians and Jewish Israelis are \nper se  racial groups but whether their identities are racialised in the local \ncontext. Racialisation, notably, is a tool or \u2018organizing grammar\u2019 of settler \ncolonialism284 and is deployed toward replacing the indigenous people(s) \non the land.285 It is therefore important to consider how Israeli laws and \n279\u2003 See, for example, Carola Lingaas, The Concept of Race in International Criminal Law (Routledge \n2020) 35.\n280\u2003 See Michael Banton, The Idea of Race (Travistock Publications 1977); see also  Dugard and Reynolds, \n\u2018Apartheid, International Law,\u2019 885 and 889.\n281\u2003 Article 1(1), ICERD.\n282\u2003 Preamble, Apartheid Convention.\n283\u2003 In support, see Miles Jackson, \u2018The Definition of Apartheid,\u2019 851, citing ICTY , Prosecutor v.

Meanwhile, an indigenous Palestinian refugee whose family \nwas expelled in and around 1948 is prohibited by Israeli law from returning \nto their homes, lands, and properties. Not only this, Palestinians inside the \nGreen Line are accorded Israeli citizenship not based on birth but on the \nbasis of residence in the land. Thus, the expulsion of Palestinian refugees \nwas supplemented with a process of denationalisation.289\nWhile Palestinian and Jewish identities are not in and of themselves racial, \nIsraeli laws as well as Zionist ideology and policy categorise Jewish Israelis \nand Palestinians as distinct \u2018racial groups,\u2019 according to which rights and \nprivileges, as well as exploitation and oppression, are determined at birth. \nIn this context, the racialisation of Jewish Israelis and Palestinians operates \n286\u2003 Article 1, Law of Return 1950.\n287\u2003 Article 4B, State of Israel, Law of Return (Amendment No 2) 5730-1970 (hereinafter \u2018Law of Return \n1970 Amendment\u2019) (emphasis added).\n288\u2003 Article 4A(a), Law of Return 1970 Amendment.\n289\u2003 Uri Davis, Israel: An Apartheid State (Zed Books, 1987) 25-38.\n\n\nConstructing Apartheid\nAL-HAQ75as a tool to entrench the domination and oppression of Palestinians under \nZionist settler colonialism.\n4.2.4   Intention of Maintaining the Regime\nThe crime of apartheid under the Rome Statute requires the presence of an \nintention to maintain the regime. Thus, it is important that any inhuman(e) \nacts committed are carried out as part of an institutionalised regime by one \nracial group to systemically dominate and oppress another group or groups, \nand it must be shown that such acts are committed with the intention of \nensuring that this regime remains in place.\nThe intention to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians \nis clearly reflected in Zionist policies of population transfer and demographic \nmanipulation, whereby Israel pursues the \u2018Judaisation\u2019 of the land, \ndispossession of Palestinians, and manipulation of Palestine\u2019s demography \nto create a Jewish demographic majority. This report details Israeli laws, \npolicies, and practices that establish domination over the Palestinian people. \nAs will become apparent in the sections below, Palestinians are subjected \nto widespread and systematic human rights violations by the Israeli \nsettler colonial state, amounting to inhuman(e) acts within the meaning \nof the crime of apartheid. These are committed with an intention to deny \nPalestinians their collective right to self-determination, through strategic \nfragmentation, the denial of the right of return of Palestinian refugees and \ndisplaced persons, freedom of movement and access restrictions, and the \nexploitation of Palestinian land and other natural resources.\nAdditionally, an examination of repressive Israeli policies and practices \ntargeting the Palestinian people, such as excessive use of force, denial of \nthe right to life, arbitrary detention, torture, collective punishment, and the \npersecution of individuals and organisations opposing apartheid, shows a \nclear intention on the part of the state authorities to maintain the regime by \naiming to prevent Palestinians from mounting a unified resistance against \ntheir oppression.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ\n\u00a9 Al-Haq Images Library\n76\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ77\n5Israel\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nUpon its establishment through the Nakba of 1948, Israel installed a legal \nregime to legitimise and legalise its violations and  crimes committed against \nthe Palestinian people, thus laying the foundations of its apartheid regime. \nAccording to Yifat Holzman-Gazit, \u2018what was notable about this process of \ntransferring a very large percentage of the national territory from Arab to \nJewish hands was the effort and energy expended by the authorities to \nconstruct a legal regime that would legitimize the expropriation.\u2019290 George \nBisharat and others have observed that \u2018while justice and fairness were \nnot present in the process of de-Arabization of the land, resort to law as \na means for executing the negation of Arab ownership rights was a prime \nconcern.\u2019291 The laws adopted following 1948 were transposed as military \norders to the occupied Palestinian territory in 1967. Since 1948, Israeli \nlaws, policies, and practices have been designed to provide the legal basis \nfor Israel\u2019s apartheid regime. Israel\u2019s overall objective today remains the \n290\u2003 Holzman-Gazit, Yifat, Land Expropriation in Israel: Law, Culture and Society, (Routledge, 2007) 105.\n291\u2003 Ibid ., 105.\n\u00a9 Al-Haq Images Library\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ78expropriation of Palestinian land and alteration of Palestine\u2019s demography \nby transferring Palestinians to expand Jewish settlement and effective \ncontrol on both sides of the Green Line. New Israeli policies and laws are \nregularly adopted to achieve this objective.\n5.1   The Central Task of Zionist Parastatal Institutions\n5.1.1  Zionist Parastatal Institutions\nAs clarified in the 1933 Montevideo Convention,292 the modern state is \nunderstood to comprise: (1) a permanent population; (2) a defined territory; \n(3) (institutions of) government; and (4) the \u2018capacity to enter into relations \nwith the other states.\u2019 Israel\u2019s case for constituting a state is unique, however.\nWell before Israel\u2019s so-called \u2018Proclamation of Independence\u2019 in 1948, the \nZionist movement\u2019s pursuit of a state rested on first establishing proto-\nstate institutions, before claiming to have a distinct population (people) \nor defined territory. The Zionist movement then set about establishing so-\ncalled \u2018national\u2019 institutions, predominantly in the forms of the WZO, in \n1897, the JNF in 1901, and the JA, in 1921. The WZO and JA then conjoined \nin 1929 as the Zionist Executive.293\nThe founders developed and maintained a complementary division of roles \nbetween and among these institutions so as to assume the public functions \nof a \u2018state in the making.\u2019 The WZO/JA sought international recognition \nas \u2018public\u2019 institutions to make way for recognition as a \u2018government.\u2019 \nThe Zionist leadership established other similarly chartered institutions \nas needed to capture and administer the other resources of the country. \nThe consistent WZO/JA program and strategy have pursued the population \ntransfer of Jewish persons to settle in Palestine for \u2018agricultural colonization \nbased on [exclusive] Jewish labour\u2019 and land acquisition, or \u2018redeeming\u2019 \nland as \u2018inalienable;\u2019 i.e., for Jewish possession \u2018in perpetuity.\u2019 To manage \nthe material dimensions of colonising Palestine (finance and acquisitions), \nthe Fifth Zionist Congress in 1901 founded the JNF as a subsidiary of the \n292\u2003 Article 1, Montevideo Convention.\n293\u2003 CERD Report, para 38.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ79WZO and its eventual sister organisation, the JA. In 1905, the JNF began \npurchasing lands in Palestine. The JNF assumed the task of acquiring and \nadministering land resources essential to the formation of a viable colony \nand settler colonial state.\nThe JNF\u2019s charter explicitly restricts its benefits \u2018whether directly or \nindirectly, to those of Jewish race or descent\u2019294 (emphasis added). Its \nchartered purpose and \u2018primary objective\u2019 were\u2014and remain\u2014to \u2018acquire \nlands in Palestine\u2019295 and to \u2018promote the interests of Jews in the prescribed \nregion.\u2019296 In decoding Israel\u2019s Zionist law and policy, any reference to these \nparastatal institutions in public functions means a statutory obligation to \ndiscriminate against all others. The JNF charter also stipulates that, \u2018upon \n[its] dissolution\u2026any properties whatsoever\u2026shall be transferred to the \nGovernment of Israel,\u2019297 further affirming its public and state functions.\nThe close working relationship of the WZO/JA and JNF to the British mandate \nadministration emerged as a \u2018shadow government\u2019 in Palestine,298 leading \nup to Israel\u2019s 1948 \u2018Proclamation of Independence.\u2019 Those specialised \nsettler colonial, apartheid, and population transfer institutions were soon \nfused to the Israeli settler colonial state by a series of legislative acts of the \nIsraeli parliament (the Knesset), including:\n* WZO-JA (Status) Law (1952);\n* Keren Kayemet Le-Israel [JNF] Law (1953);\n* Covenant with Zionist Executive (1954, amended 1971);\n* Basic Law: Israel Lands [People\u2019s Lands] (1960);\n* Agricultural Settlement Law (1967).\nThe WZO/JA and the JNF remain pillars of Israel\u2019s discriminatory systems of \n294\u2003 That is \u2018to purchase, acquire on lease, or in exchange, or receive on lease or otherwise, lands, \nforests, rights of possession, easements and any similar rights, as well as immovable properties \nof any class\u2026for the purpose of settling Jews on such lands and properties\u2019; Article 3(iii), JNF \nMemorandum of Association (1952).\n295\u2003 Article 3(a), JNF Memorandum of Association (1901), and Article 3(i), JNF Memorandum of \nAssociation (1953).\n296\u2003 Ibid ., Article 3(g) and Article 3(vii), respectively.\n297\u2003 Ibid ., Article 6.\n298\u2003 Mallison and Mallison, The Palestine Problem,  98-101.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ80housing, urban planning and development, and land administration.

The Law states for its purposes that the WZO, \noperating also as the JA, continues to manage Jewish colonial settlement \nprojects in the state. It authorises it to develop and settle Jews in the \ncountry and to coordinate with Jewish institutions and organisations active \nin those fields. The Status Law also establishes that their joint operations \nunder a conjoined Zionist Executive constitute \u2018[t]he mission of gathering in \nthe exiles [sic]\u2026 the central task of the State of Israel.\u2019\n5.1.2   Apartheid and Settler Colonial Charters\nSince their founding, these proto-state and now, parastatal, institutions have \nbuilt on the ideological foundation, expressed in their respective charters, \nthat persons of Jewish faith constitute a separate \u2018Jewish nationality\u2019300 \ndefined in \u2018racial\u2019 supremacy terms with correspondingly exclusive control \nof, and benefit from the resources of Palestine. Israeli legislation, deferring \nto principles of the JA, for example, triggers the condition of only benefitting \nJews as natural persons holding this superior \u2018nationality\u2019 status. Through \nthese institutions\u2019 extraterritorial operations, Israel imposes this status, \ndistinct from Israeli citizenship, on persons of Jewish faith who are citizens \nof states other than Israel. Meanwhile, this supposed \u2018Jewish nationality\u2019 \nstatus entitles each member to automatic citizenship in Israel upon arrival \nin Palestine (except in certain cases of criminal conviction or apostacy).\n299\u2003 WZO-JA (Status) Law 5713-1952 (hereinafter \u2018Status Law\u2019).\n300\u2003 See generally, W T Mallison, Jr, \u2018The Zionist-Israel Juridical Claims to Constitute \u201cthe Jewish People\u201d \nNationality and to Confer Membership in It: Appraisal in Public International Law\u2019 (1963) 32 The \nGeorge Washington Law Review 983.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ81The Status Law authorises the WZO, JA, and their affiliates to function \nin areas under Israel\u2019s effective control\u2014which, since 1967, include the \noccupied Palestinian territory and the occupied Syrian Golan\u2014as quasi-\ngovernmental entities.301 The Law states for its purposes that the WZO, \noperating also as the JA, continues to manage Jewish settlement projects \nin the state and authorises it to develop and settle \u2018Jewish nationals\u2019 in the \ncountry and to coordinate with Jewish institutions and organisations active \nin those fields.\nIsrael\u2019s parastatal institutions, notably the WZO, JA, and the JNF, are \nchartered to carry out material discrimination against non-Jewish persons \nand have historically prevented the Palestinian people on both sides of \nthe Green Line from accessing or exercising control over their means of \nsubsistence, including their natural wealth and resources, by exploiting and \ndiverting these for the benefit of Jewish Israeli settlers.

The JNF \nsupports both operations.306 The Israeli state, its laws, and organs formally \ndefer to Zionist parastatal institutions in all matters of legislation and policy \naffecting development, commerce, agriculture, access to and control over \nnatural resources, urban planning, and civil matters.307 Thus, the granting \nof quasi-governmental status to Zionist institutions forms part and parcel \nof the institutionalisation of Israel\u2019s apartheid regime over the Palestinian \npeople, wherever they reside.\nOther such apartheid-chartered institutions include the Histadrut trade-union \nconglomerate (1920), managing (Jewish) labour resources,308 and Mekorot, \nformed in 1937 by Histadrut, the JNF, and the JA, to govern water resources \nwith the same discriminatory purpose and effect.

With the start of \nthe Nakba in 1948, around 80 per cent of the Palestinian people became \nrefugees, dispossessed of their land and property and displaced to the \nWest Bank, including the eastern part of Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, and \nneighbouring countries. The Palestinian people have endured an ongoing \ncycle of displacement and denial of return ever since, with a second wave \nof mass displacement following the 1967 war and Israel\u2019s ongoing policy \nof population transfer.313 By the end of 2018, approximately 8.7 million \nPalestinians314 had been displaced, both within historic Palestine and abroad. \nToday, some 5.7 million Palestinian refugees are registered with UNRWA.315\nOnce domination was established through military conquest, occupation, \nand the extension of Zionist colonisation, the Israeli regime adopted a \nseries of instrumental laws and related policies and practices pertaining \nto nationality, residency, and immigration to rationalise the displacement, \ndispossession, and transfer of the indigenous Palestinian people from their \nancestral lands.316 Israeli laws pertaining to immigration and citizenship \nestablish two separate and unequal legal categories for \u2018Jews\u2019 and \u2018non-\nJews,\u2019317 in which Jews are prioritised, privileged, and receive preferential \ntreatment, while indigenous Palestinians are further dispossessed of their \nlands and properties and face ongoing oppression. \n313\u2003 BADIL, Q and A: What you need to know about Palestinian Refugees and Internally Displaced \nPersons (March 2020) 15-16 <http://www.badil.org/phocadownloadpap/badil-new/campaining-\ntools/brochures/2020/Q&A-en.pdf>.\n314\u2003 Ibid ., 16.\n315\u2003 UNRWA, \u2018UNRWA in Figures 2020-2021\u2019 (6 September 2021) <https://www.unrwa.org/resources/\nabout-unrwa/unrwa-figures-2020-2021>.\n316\u2003 Baptiste Sellier, \u2018L\u2019usage du droit foncier par l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Isra\u00ebl comme arme d\u2019appropriation de l\u2019espace \nPalestinien : Quelle comparaison avec l\u2019 Alg\u00e9rie Coloniale ?\u2019 1 <http://larhra.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/sites/\ndefault/files/event-files/article%20B%20Sellier.pdf>.\n317\u2003 Uri Davis, Israel: An Apartheid State (Zed Books, 1987) 26-38.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ855.2.1  Constructing a Superior \u2018Jewish Nationality\u2019 Status\nThe Law of Return (1950)318 is the cornerstone of Israel\u2019s apartheid regime \nover the Palestinian people. It grants every Jewish person the exclusive \nright as an oleh (\u2018Jewish immigrant\u2019) to enter and settle the land of historic \nPalestine. Since 1950, this law has been the basis for the immigration \nthereto of Jewish persons born anywhere in the world. The Law of Return is \napplicable exclusively to Jewish persons and cements the existence of two \nseparate legal categories for \u2018Jewish\u2019 and \u2018non-Jewish\u2019 persons. Through \nincorporation of Zionist ideology into Israeli law, Israel thereby established a \nsuperior status for \u2018Jewish nationals\u2019 that is distinct from citizenship. In stark \ncontrast, Palestinian refugees, whether living in the occupied Palestinian \nterritory or abroad, are categorically denied their right of return.\nThe Law of Return \u2018assigns the right for \u201cJewish nationality\u201d to every Jewish \nindividual anywhere in the world,\u2019 as BADIL has noted.319 The public law \nnotion of \u2018Jewish nationality\u2019 is an extraterritorial concept. It encompasses \nJewish persons with the citizenship of other states. This concept forms \nthe core of Zionist ideology that claims that all Jewish persons belong to \na separate \u2018Jewish nation\u2019 and, as a result, owe \u2018allegiance\u2019 to the Israeli \nstate and hold exclusive rights to settle the land of Palestine. This status, \naccording to Israeli law, is conferred upon birth to any Jewish person in the \nworld. In a challenge to this notion by the American Council for Judaism, \nthe United States Department of State rejected the notion of \u2018Jewish \nnationality\u2019 as a concept of international law already in the 1960s.320\nIn 1952, the Knesset adopted the Citizenship Law,321 which is often \ndeceptively mistranslated as a \u2018law of nationality,\u2019 creating confusion \n318\u2003 The Law of Return, 1950. \n319\u2003 BADIL, Forced Population Transfer: The Case of Palestine \u2013 Denial of Residency Working Paper \nNo. 16 (April 2014) 10 <http://www.badil.org/phocadownload/badil-new/publications/research/\nworking-papers/wp16-Residency.pdf>.\n320\u2003 Letter of United States Assistant Secretary of State Phillip Talbot to the American Council for \nJudaism\u2019s Executive Vice-President Rabbi Elmer Berger, 20 April 1964, reprinted in W.

Israel\u2019s Citizenship Law recognises \n\u2018return\u2019 as one pathway to Israeli citizenship. However, this pathway is \nunique to Jewish persons, defined as persons born to a Jewish mother or, \nin rare cases, who have converted to Judaism. The Citizenship Law sets \nout three other ways to become an Israeli citizen: by birth, marriage, or \nresidency. However, because of the superior status of \u2018Jewish nationality,\u2019 \ncitizenship is not and has never been a basis for equal rights in the Israeli \nlegal system.322 Thus, the Citizenship Law entrenches Israel\u2019s separate \nand unequal apartheid regime into Israeli law. Moreover, the Citizenship \nLaw nullified the British mandate-era 1925 Palestinian Citizenship Order-\nin-Council that created the legal status of Palestinian citizenship in \nmandatory Palestine. As Tatour argued, \u2018Israel\u2019s decision to discontinue \nPalestinian citizenship was an act affirming Jewish independence and \nproclaiming sovereignty\u2026 an act of erasure.\u2019323\nThe Citizenship Law confers automatic Israeli citizenship by birth to any \nJewish person born anywhere in the world, who enters Israeli-controlled \nterritory under the Law of Return. It grants Jewish persons the right to settle \nin any part of the territory under Israeli jurisdiction or effective control, \nincluding the occupied Palestinian territory and the occupied Syrian Golan. \nSince the start of its occupation, the Law of Return has been used by the \nIsraeli regime to extend the same benefits and privileges to Jewish settlers \nillegally residing in the territories occupied since 1967, who are considered \n\u2018residents of Israel\u2019 or are entitled to \u2018immigrate\u2019 under the Law of Return.\nIn turn, Palestinian rights or rather the denial thereof is justified under \nIsraeli law on the basis of residency (or failure to prove residency) in the \ncountry. It is through this mechanism that millions of Palestinians who \nbecame refugees in and around 1948 have been legally denationalised \nand, through prevention of their right of return, denied residency in the \ncountry and barred from obtaining legal status in their homeland.

Jewish nationals are accorded full rights and privileges under \nIsraeli law, including to bring their spouses into the country. In this way, \nthe constructed legal concept of \u2018Jewish nationality\u2019 operates through the \ninclusion of persons identified as superior and the exclusion of everyone \nelse, particularly targeting the indigenous Palestinian people.\nIn 2018, the Knesset adopted the Basic Law: Israel\u2014The Nation-State of \nthe Jewish People (hereinafter \u2018Jewish Nation-State Basic Law\u2019).326 The law \nexemplifies the apartheid nature of Israel\u2019s legal system. It reaffirms the \nZionist character of the Israeli state and further elevates the privileged \nstatus of Jewish persons therein, whether or not they hold Israeli citizenship. \nThrough its articulation of the state\u2019s character as \u2018exclusively Jewish,\u2019 the \nJewish Nation-State Basic Law further weakens the constitutional status \nof the indigenous Palestinian people.327 As a Basic Law, it modifies the \nstate\u2019s constitutional framework to serve Jewish persons, as a racial group. \nIt explicitly provides under Article 1(c) that: \u2018The exercise of the right to \nnational self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish \npeople.\u2019 Article 7 of the law further provides:\n324\u2003 HSRC Study, 212-14.\n325\u2003 Tatour, \u2018Citizenship as Domination,\u2019 10.\n326\u2003 Basic Law: Israel \u2013 The Nation-State of the Jewish People (2018) (hereinafter \u2018Jewish Nation-State \nBasic Law\u2019) <https://knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/BasicLawNationState.pdf>.\n327\u2003 See  Adalah, Israel\u2019s Nation State Law <https://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/9569>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ88The State views the development of Jewish settlement as a national \nvalue, and shall act to encourage and promote its establishment \nand strengthening.\nThus, throughout historic Palestine and in the occupied Syrian Golan, the \nJewish Nation-State Basic Law provides for the entrenchment and expansion \nof Jewish colonial settlement at the expense of the indigenous peoples. As \nsuch, it escalates indigenous displacement and dispossession.328 Within the \nframework of international humanitarian law, the Jewish Nation-State Basic \nLaw effectively extends illegal Israeli settlement as a \u2018national value\u2019 into \nthe territories occupied since 1967, in direct violation of Israel\u2019s obligations \nas the Occupying Power.\nThe Jewish Nation-State Basic Law represents the most significant \nescalation in the overt legalisation of Israel\u2019s apartheid regime against the \nPalestinian people since 1948. Yet, as discussed earlier in this report, it only \nentrenched what was already established under Zionist doctrine and policy \nsince the start of settler colonisation in historic Palestine. Through Israeli \nlegislation in the area of nationality, the Palestinian people are relegated \nto an inferior status and expressly denied their collective rights, notably \nto self-determination, return, and permanent sovereignty over natural \nresources. Such institutionalised discrimination exemplifies the use of \nIsraeli apartheid legislation as a tool to enable and further entrench Zionist \nsettler colonialisation.\n328\u2003 See Al-Haq, Factsheet: Israel\u2019s \u201cJewish Nation-State Law\u201d and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (23 \nJanuary 2019) <http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6115.html>.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ895.2.2 Denationalisation of Palestinians: (Denial of) Citizenship and \nResidency\nThrough institutionalising a superior \u2018Jewish nationality\u2019 status under Israeli \nlaw, Israel has denationalised Palestinian refugees en masse since 1948. The \ndenial of residency and citizenship rights to Palestinians is a key tool used by \nthe Israeli regime as part of its wider strategy to transfer and fragment the \nPalestinian people, and thereby engineer a Jewish demographic majority. \nPalestinians permanently residing within the Green Line after 1948 were \ngranted Israeli citizenship from 1952 onward. However, the process was by \nno means straightforward and for many Palestinian families it took years \nand even decades before they were granted Israeli citizenship. Indeed, \napproximately 63,000 of the estimated 160,000 Palestinians living inside \nthe Green Line received citizenship with the enactment of the Citizenship \nLaw in 1952.329 As noted by Tatour, \u2018the decision to extend citizenship was \nmotivated by a desire to solidify the demographic outcomes of the Nakba\u2026 \nby denying the possibility of citizenship to as many Palestinians as possible.\u2019330 \nGiven its bifurcation from \u2018nationality\u2019 status, Israeli citizenship remains a \nprecarious status that can be revoked at any time by the Israeli regime, \nusing broad and vague criteria. For example, the Israeli state has summarily \nrevoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinian Bedouin living in the \nNaqab region, thus rendering them stateless.331 Amendment No 30 (2008) \nto the Citizenship Law gave the Israeli government the power to revoke \nIsraeli citizenship on grounds of \u2018breach of allegiance\u2019 to the Zionist state, \na measure that is defined broadly. For example, it lists as grounds for \nrevocation the act of residing in one of nine Arab and Muslim states as well \nas the Gaza Strip, without requiring a criminal investigation.332 The law has \nnever been used against a Jewish Israeli citizen.333\n329\u2003 Tatour, \u2018Citizenship as Domination,\u2019 30.\n330\u2003 Ibid ., 14.\n331\u2003 Adalah, Israel illegally revoking citizenship from thousands of Bedouin citizens, leaving them \nstateless (18 September 2017) <https://www.adalah.org/en/content/view/9238>.\n332\u2003 Haneen Naamnih, \u2018New Anti-Arab Legislation\u2019 (2008) 50 Adalah\u2019s Newsletter 1 <http://www.\nadalah.org/newsletter/ara/jul08/haneene.doc>.\n333\u2003 BADIL, Forced Population Transfer, No. 16 , 25-26.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ90In Jerusalem, the same process has been implemented through targeting \nPalestinians\u2019 residency rights in the city. By creating the precarious \nstatus of \u2018permanent residents\u2019 for Palestinians in the eastern part of \nJerusalem since 1967, the Israeli state created a situation whereby entry \ninto and residency in Jerusalem is a revocable privilege as opposed to a \nright. Residency revocation is the most common and direct tool used \nto transfer protected Palestinians from the city of Jerusalem.334 Israeli \noccupying authorities instituted onerous requirements for Palestinians \nin Jerusalem to continuously prove that their so-called \u2018centre of life\u2019 is \nin the city in order to maintain their residency rights. In 1995, the Israeli \nInterior Ministry initiated a new policy whereby residency could be revoked \nif a permanent resident\u2019s \u2018centre of life\u2019 had moved \u2018outside of Israel,\u2019 a \npolicy that also included the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. \nPalestinians with permanent residency in Jerusalem are required to provide \nproof that Jerusalem is their \u2018centre of life\u2019 through documentation such \nas home ownership papers, rent contracts, bills for municipal services, and \nchildren\u2019s school registration in a stringent and non-transparent process.335 \nPalestinians in Jerusalem who cannot prove this severe criteria for seven \nyears or more thereby lose their right to live in their city and are forced to \nleave their homes.336 Since 1967, the Israeli state has revoked the residency \nstatus of over 14,500 Palestinians from Jerusalem.337\nOver the years, Israel has gradually expanded the criteria for the revocation \nof residency rights, including increasingly on punitive grounds. On 7 March \n2018, the Knesset codified such practice with the adoption of Amendment \nNo 30 to the Entry into Israel Law, which gave the Interior Minister the \npower to revoke the permanent residency status of Palestinian residents \nof Jerusalem for so-called \u2018breach of allegiance to Israel.\u2019338 According to \n334\u2003 Al-Haq, Residency Revocation: Israel\u2019s Forcible Transfer of Palestinians from Jerusalem (3 July 2017) \n<https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6331.html>. \n335\u2003 BADIL, Forced Population Transfer, No. 16, 24.\n336\u2003 Ibid .\n337\u2003 Al-Haq, Punitive Residency Revocation: the Most Recent Tool of Forcible Transfer (17 March 2018) \n<http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6257.html>.\n338\u2003 Al-Haq, Urgent Appeal: Israel Must Suspend and Repeal Recent Legislation Allowing for the \nRevocation of Permanent Residency Status from Palestinians in Jerusalem for \u2018Breach of Allegiance\u2019 \n(8 March 2018) <https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6262.html>.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ91the Interior Ministry, there have been 13 cases of residency revocation due \nto \u2018breach of allegiance\u2019 since 2006. In accordance with Article 45 of the \nHague Regulations, international humanitarian law prohibits Israel, as the \nOccupying Power, from compelling the civilian population in the occupied \nterritory to swear allegiance to the occupier.\nNevertheless, as part of its establishment of an institutionalised regime \nof oppression and domination, the Israeli state continues to control the \ngranting of residency status to Palestinians. After the 1967 war, the Israeli \noccupying authorities also put in place a residency system for Palestinians \nin the rest of the West Bank and Gaza Strip under Israeli military law. \nThis system also included mechanisms for revoking residency status. \nPalestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory were required to acquire \nexit permits, at the discretion of the Israeli Interior Ministry, to travel \nabroad. If a resident failed to return before the expiration of their permit, \nthey were at risk of being deleted from the population registry and losing \ntheir residency status.339 From 1967 until 1994, the Israeli state revoked \nthe residency status of around 140,000 Palestinians from the West Bank \nand 108,878 from the Gaza Strip.340 Under the Oslo Accords, authority \nover the population registry was transferred to the newly-established \nPalestinian Authority in 1995. The Palestinian Authority was permitted \nto grant permanent residency in the West Bank, excluding the eastern \npart of Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip for family unification, subject \nto the approval of the Israeli occupying authorities. On this basis, the \nPalestinian Authority cannot issue valid identity cards for Palestinians on \nits own without Israel\u2019s approval, as a result of which many Palestinians \nare left without documentation. Until October 2021, the Israeli occupying \nauthorities had imposed a decade-long freeze on the process, during \nwhich almost no residency requests for Palestinians were approved.341\n339\u2003 BADIL, Forced Population Transfer, No. 16 , 18.\n340\u2003 HaMoked, \u2018Ceased Residency\u2019: between 1967 and 1994 Israel revoked the residency of some \nquarter million Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip (12 June 2012) <http://www.\nhamoked.org/Document.aspx?dID=Updates1175>.\n341\u2003 The Times of Israel, \u2018Israel approves residency for 4,000 Palestinians, after 10-year freeze\u2019 (19 \nOctober 2021) <https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-authorizes-some-4000-undocumented-\npalestinians-after-10-year-freeze/>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ925.2.3  Targeting Palestinian Rights in Jerusalem\nIn 1967, the Israeli occupying authorities illegally annexed the eastern part \nof Jerusalem, in violation of international law and seized control over and \nplaced restrictions on the movement of people to, from, and within the \noccupied Palestinian territory. Under the Entry into Israel Law of 1952,342 \nIsraeli occupying authorities imposed the precarious \u2018permanent resident\u2019 \nstatus on Palestinians present in the eastern part of Jerusalem following \nthe 1967 war, effectively rendering Palestinians \u2018foreign visitors\u2019 in the city \nof their birth. As of May 2021, there were 358,804 Palestinian \u2018permanent \nresidents\u2019 of Jerusalem.343 Residency revocation became a tool of Zionist \npopulation transfer and demographic manipulation in Jerusalem to implant \nJewish settlers and settlements in their place, in violation of the status of \nthe city of Jerusalem under international law and the inalienable right of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination, including permanent sovereignty.344\nThe 2000 Jerusalem Master Plan, the first comprehensive plan developed by \nthe municipality of occupation for the whole city of Jerusalem, was tellingly \ndrafted without any consultation with Palestinians living in the city. The \nplan clearly shows the Israeli settler colonial state\u2019s intentions to dominate \nand control the city of Jerusalem, while imposing its desired demographic \nmakeup. The occupation municipality\u2019s plan is overtly discriminatory as it \nexplicitly seeks to secure a demographic ratio of 70 per cent Israeli Jews \nto 30 per cent Palestinians in the city. At the same time, it recognises as \nmore probable a ratio of 60 per cent Israeli Jews to 40 per cent Palestinians, \n\u2018to create a demographic and geographic reality capable of curbing any \nefforts to challenge Israeli sovereignty in East Jerusalem.\u2019345 For example, \nthe plan calls for 13,500 new housing units for Palestinians in the city, far \nshort of the projected 15,000\u201330,000 units needed by 2030.

The Israeli legislature\u2019s so-\ncalled \u2018Greater Jerusalem\u2019 bills openly seek to alter the city\u2019s demographic \ncomposition through forcing the removal of densely-populated Palestinian \nneighbourhoods from Jerusalem and the incorporation of roughly the same \nnumber of Jewish settlers.\nThese measures are in addition to the Israeli state policy to isolate and \nphysically separate Palestinians in Jerusalem from the rest of the West \nBank and Gaza Strip, a policy that has resulted in the severe obstruction \nand marginalisation of Palestinian political, social, economic, and cultural \nlife in the city. Since construction began in 2002, the Annexation Wall and \nits associated closure and permit regime, including checkpoints and road \nclosures, have radically transformed the city and entrenched Palestinian \nfragmentation.349 The route of the Annexation Wall in and around the city \nof Jerusalem serves Israel\u2019s long-term demographic goals to annex as much \nland as possible with minimal Palestinian presence.350 \n346\u2003 Ibid ., 39-40.\n347\u2003 Al-Haq, The Occupation and Annexation of Jerusalem through Israeli Bills and Laws (15 March 2018) \n<https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6263.html>.\n348\u2003 Jaclynn Ashly, \u2018Palestinians in Kufr Aqab: \u201cWe live here just to wait\u201d\u2019 (Al Jazeera , 7 January 2018) \n<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/1/7/palestinians-in-kufr-aqab-we-live-here-just-to-wait>.\n349\u2003 See generally, UNCTAD, The Palestinian economy in East Jerusalem: Enduring annexation, isolation \nand disintegration (2013)  <https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/gdsapp2012d1_en.pdf>.\n350\u2003 B\u2019Tselem, The Separation Barrier (11 November 2017) <https://www.btselem.org/separation_barrier>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ94Through its fragmentation of the occupied Palestinian territory and closure \nof Jerusalem, Israel has pursued the social and economic suffocation of \nPalestinians in Jerusalem while attempting to redirect Palestinian presence \naway from the city.351\nThe Israeli policy toward Jerusalem has worked to radically alter the \ncharacter and composition of the city through \u2018Judaisation\u2019 of street names \nand expansion of illegal Israeli settlements,352 including within Palestinian \nneighbourhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah353 and Silwan.354 These policies have \nbeen further apparent in the Old City of Jerusalem, which remains a central \ntarget of Israel\u2019s goal to erase Palestinian presence, culture, heritage, and \nidentity in the city.355\n5.2.4  Denial of Family Life and Child Registration\nIn accordance with Zionist doctrine, Israeli policy pertaining to the domains \nof family life and child registration is materially discriminatory and intended \nto escalate the transfer of Palestinians from their homes and lands. \nPalestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinian exiles \nwho are citizens of third states, face significant challenges in receiving family \nunification permits when marrying a Palestinian resident of Jerusalem or a \nPalestinian citizen of Israel.356 Such racially-motivated restrictions not only \nundermine the right to family life, but also prevent natural Palestinian \npopulation growth and place severe stress and uncertainty on Palestinian \nfamilies and children.\n351\u2003 Marya Farah, Occupying Jerusalem\u2019s Old City: Israeli Policies of Isolation, Intimidation and \nTransformation  (Al-Haq, 2019) <http://www.alhaq.org/publications/15212.html>.\n352\u2003 Al-Haq, Atarot Settlement: The Industrial Key in Israel\u2019s Plant to Permanently Erase Palestine \n(2020) <https://www.alhaq.org/cached_uploads/download/2020/06/02/atarot-settlement-\ninteractive-1591084307.pdf>.\n353\u2003 Al-Haq, \u2018Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan: Ongoing Nakba and Israeli Dispossession of Palestinians\u2019 (27 May \n2021) <https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/18442.html>.\n354\u2003 Antoine Fr\u00e8re, House Demolitions and Forced Evictions in Silwan: Israel\u2019s Transfer of Palestinians \nfrom Jerusalem (Al-Haq, 2020) <https://www.alhaq.org/publications/17247.html>.\n355\u2003 Marya Farah, Occupying Jerusalem\u2019s Old City , 57.\n356\u2003 Al-Haq, Engineering Community: Family Uni\ufb01cation, Entry Restrictions and other Israeli Policies of \nFragmenting Palestinians  (13 February 2019) 6-7 <https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6106.html>.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ95The Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, first enacted in 2003 as a \nTemporary Order by the Knesset, prohibits the granting of residency or \ncitizenship status to Palestinian spouses from the occupied Palestinian \nterritory who are married to Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, thereby \ndenying them of their rights to family unification, family life, equality in \nmarriage, and choice of spouse, contrary to Article 23 of the ICCPR. In \n2008, the Israeli state completely banned family unification for Palestinians \nfrom the Gaza Strip.357 Meanwhile, Palestinians with Jerusalem residency \nstatus who marry West Bank residents are required to apply for family \nunification.

Israeli law and Zionist parastatal institutions then expanded this \ndemographic-manipulation system through discriminatory zoning and \nplanning policies to further confiscate and appropriate Palestinian land, \nrestrict and confine the growth of Palestinian villages and cities, and exclude \nPalestinians from residing in exclusive Jewish settlements on both sides \nof the Green Line. After annexing the whole of the Naqab region in the \nsouth, the Israeli military proceeded to demolish 108 Naqab villages and \nvillage points, while transferring their Palestinian inhabitants into a central-\nNaqab enclosure, known as siyaj, in what Israeli planners called rekuzim \n(concentrations), where they mostly are confined today.376\nWithin weeks after the 1967 war, the Israeli military government \nextended such laws and practices, already well established under \nIsraeli military administration inside the Green Line (1948\u20131966), to the \noccupied Palestinian territory.377 These actions violated the international \nhumanitarian law prohibition against an Occupying Power altering the legal \ninstitutions in an occupied territory.378 As in the 1948 Nakba, these included \ndepopulating and transferring Palestinians from strategic areas to achieve \nthe desired Jewish-majority demography and justifying the annexation of \nadditional Palestinian territory.

In 1967, the Israeli occupying authorities extended the \nlaw to the eastern part of Jerusalem along with its illegal annexation. Since \nthen, Israeli settler groups have used the Absentee Property Law to further \npursue Palestinian dispossession across the city.391\nThe Absentee Property Law has created significant obstacles for \nPalestinians to successfully establish their rights to property or land. This \nlaw did not only apply to Palestinians outside of historic Palestine, but also \nto Palestinian survivors of the Nakba, including those internally displaced \ninside the Green Line. It has also resulted in significant difficulties for \nPalestinians when seeking to obtain Israeli-issued licenses to build and \ncomplete property transactions.392 The Absentee Property Law also created \nthe paradoxical category of \u2018present absentees\u2019 for Palestinians who were \ninternally displaced within the Green Line and whose properties were \nconfiscated by the state.393 In addition to the Absentee Property Law, the \nIsraeli state adopted the Prevention of Infiltration Law (1954). This legislative \ndevice considered Palestinians whom Zionist militias had expelled to be \n\u2018infiltrators\u2019 who could be imprisoned for up to five years or heavily fined \nfor returning to their homes and properties.\nIn January 1949, shortly after Zionist forces ethnically cleansed much \nof Palestine, the Israeli settler state conferred one million dunams of \nPalestinian refugees\u2019 land and other properties to the JNF. In October 1950, \nthe state transferred another 1.2 million dunams of refugees\u2019 lands to the \nJNF. The tactical meaning of these land transfers is important, because, as \nexplained by a JNF spokesperson in 1951, the transfer of title to the JNF \nwas intended to \u2018redeem the lands and\u2026 turn them over to the Jewish \npeople\u2014to the people and not the state, which in the current composition \n391\u2003 Ibid .\n392\u2003 Ibid .\n393\u2003 Haneen Naamnih, \u2018Palestinian Refugees\u2019 Property in Their Own Land: Politics of Absence and \nAlienation\u2019 in Nadim N Rouhana and Areej Sabbagh-Khoury (eds), The Palestinians in Israel: \nReadings in History, Politics and Society (2nd volume, Mada al-Carmel Arab Center for Applied \nSocial Research, 2018) 50.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ103of population cannot be an adequate guarantor of Jewish ownership.\u2019394\nIn September 1953, the Israeli Custodian of Absentee Properties executed \na contract with the Israeli Department of Construction and Development, \nwhereby the Custodian transferred the ownership of all the Palestinian \nlands under his control to the latter. The price for these properties was to \nbe retained by the Israeli Department of Construction and Development \nas a loan. At the same time, the Custodian conveyed the ownership of the \nhouses and commercial buildings in the cities to Amidar, a quasi-public \nIsraeli company founded to settle Jewish persons,395 and thus began a \npractice that forms an unbroken pattern to this day.\nThree months before that 1953 transaction, the JNF also executed a \ncontract with the Israeli Department of Construction and Development, \nacquiring 2,373,677 dunams of land. By this time, the JNF had become \nstatutorily fused to the Israeli state by the Status Law. The deal was \ncompleted after the Department concluded its transaction with the \nCustodian. As a result, Palestinian property changed hands and its \nconsolidation under the JNF, whose \u2018ownership\u2019 totalled over 90 per cent \nof the total territories that fell under the control of the Israeli state in \n1948. The landed properties are referred to in Israel as \u2018national land,\u2019 \na subtle-but-important distinction, understood to mean that it is limited \nto exclusive use by Jews (\u2018Jewish nationals\u2019), whoever and wherever they \nmay be, and foreclosed to the indigenous Palestinian people, including its \nrightful private and collective owners.396\nIn addition, the Land Acquisition Law (Actions and Compensation), adopted in \n1953, allowed for the transfer of land ownership from its Palestinian owners \nto the state that had been previously taken for military and development \npurposes or existing and newly-established Jewish settlements.397 As a result, \n394\u2003 Jewish National Fund, Report to the 23rd Congress, 32-33 (emphasis in original), cited in Walter Lehn \nand Uri Davis, The Jewish National Fund (Kegan Paul, 1988) 108.\n395\u2003 Sabri Jiryis, The Arabs in Israel (Monthly Review Press, 1976) 77-101; Usama Halabi, \u2018Israeli Law as a \nTool of Confiscation, Planning, and Settlement Policy\u2019 (2000) 2 Adalah\u2019s Review 7-13.\n396\u2003 Jiryis, The Arabs in Israel , 77-101.\n397\u2003 Baptiste Sellier, \u2018L\u2019usage du droit foncier par l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Isra\u00ebl comme arme d\u2019appropriation de l\u2019espace \nPalestinien : Quelle comparaison avec l\u2019 Alg\u00e9rie Coloniale ?\u2019 4 <http://larhra.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/sites/\ndefault/files/event-files/article%20B%20Sellier.pdf>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ104an additional 1.2 to 1.3 million dunams of land were expropriated from the \nPalestinian people.398 In conjunction, the Land Ordinance of 1943 and its \namendments, originating from the British mandate era, has also been used \nto confiscate Palestinian land for \u2018public purposes\u2019 and transfer it to state \nownership.399 Much of the confiscations of Palestinian land inside the Green \nLine took place between 1948 until the end of military rule in 1966, but they \ncontinue under various other pretexts.400\nOther laws imposed following Israel\u2019s establishment also contribute to \nthe \u2018legalisation\u2019 of the acquisition of territory by force and the forcible \ntransfer of Palestinians. The Basic Law: Israel Lands (1960) ensured \nthat the ownership of \u2018Israel lands\u2019\u2014namely land, houses, buildings, \nand anything permanent fixed to land\u2014by Israeli state institutions and \nZionist parastatal institutions is non-transferrable beyond three entities, \nthe state, the JNF, and the Development Authority, thereby preventing \nits return to Palestinians.401 In parallel, the Israel Lands Administration \nLaw (1960) established the Israel Lands Administration to administer the \nnewly-gained land acquired by conquest, confiscation, and expropriation, \nand the Israel Lands Council, which is empowered to develop the land \npolicy and supervise the activities of the administration.402 However, the \nlaw allows for the transfer of ownership among those three entities and \nremains fully consistent with the JNF charter\u2019s cardinal rule: to manage \nand lease land on behalf of Jews only.403\nIt must be understood that, within the founding principles of the WZO/JA and \nJNF, the designation as public and state land renders said land exclusively for \nJewish use.

A 2005 amendment to this law expanded the Israel \nLands Administration\u2019s powers and those of its agencies to use administrative \norders to dispossess Palestinians. Although Israeli state agencies have applied \nit to alter the demographic composition of Jerusalem404 and elsewhere, the \n2005 amendment was aimed primarily against the Palestinian Bedouin in the \nsouthern Naqab.\nIn 1967, Israel extended the application of the Absentee Property Law to \nthe eastern part of Jerusalem following its illegal annexation. As a result, \nmost property in there was considered \u2018absentee property,\u2019 because it was \nwithin the \u2018territory of Israel\u2019 and the Palestinian owners were Jordanian \ncitizens following Jordan\u2019s control over the West Bank from 1948 to 1967.405 \nThis issue was partially resolved following the passage of the Legal and \nAdministrative Matters Law in 1970, which determined that Palestinian \nresidents of Jerusalem would not be considered absentees for their property \nin the city, yet Palestinians residing outside the eastern part of Jerusalem \nremained defined as \u2018absentees.\u2019406 Palestinian Jerusalem residents \nremained absentees with respect to their property within the Green Line as \nwell.

Since 1948, only \na handful of government-planned townships were created to concentrate \nPalestinian Bedouin communities in the Naqab and the Galilee, while in \ncontrast more than 900 Jewish localities have been created.428 In order to \nconfine Palestinian towns and villages, Israeli authorities have systematically \ndesignated the land surrounding them for \u2018security zones,\u2019 Jewish regional \ncouncils, \u2018national parks,\u2019 nature reserves, and highways.429 As a result, \nsome 15 to 20 per cent of homes in Palestinian towns and villages lack \npermits, putting some 60,000 to 70,000 Palestinian homes inside the Green \nLine at risk of demolition.430 In contrast, the state provides sufficient land \nand zoning permissions for Jewish Israelis, \u2018to facilitate their growth.\u2019431\nIn the Gaza Strip, while isolating Palestinians through an illegal 15-year-\nlong land, sea, and air blockade and closure, the Israeli occupying \nauthorities designated land along the Gaza fence as \u2018access restricted area\u2019 \nor \u2018buffer zone\u2019 to restrict Palestinians\u2019 access to their land.

As outlined in the \nESCWA report, Israel\u2019s apartheid has administratively divided the Palestinian \npeople into at least four legal \u2018domains,\u2019 including Palestinians with Israeli \ncitizenship subject to Israeli civil law, Palestinians with permanent residency \nstatus in occupied East Jerusalem, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank \nand Gaza Strip subject to Israeli military law, and Palestinian refugees and \nexiles abroad, whose right of return continues to be denied.438\nBy 2019, there were approximately 1.9 million Palestinians with Israeli \ncitizenship, comprising some 21 per cent of the state\u2019s citizens.439 As non-\nJewish persons, they are accorded an inferior legal status, face discrimination \nin access to services, limited budget allocations, and restrictions in access \nto jobs and other professional opportunities. While Palestinians are \nrepresented in the Knesset, their representation is superficial, because \ntheir elected officials are barred by Israel\u2019s Basic Laws from challenging or \nintroducing legislation that would compromise the \u2018Jewish character\u2019 of \nthe state.440 For example, when the Joint List attempted to challenge the \nproposed bill for the Jewish Nation-State Basic Law in 2018 by submitting a \nbill titled \u2018Israel as the Nation-State of all its Citizens,\u2019 the Knesset presidium \n436\u2003 Wafa, \u2018PCBS: Some 14.3 million Palestinians in the world in mid-2022\u2019 (7 July 2022) <https://english.\nwafa.ps/Pages/Details/129983>; PCBS, \u2018Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) Presents the \nConditions of Palestinian Populations on the Occasion of the International Population Day,\u2019 (11 July \n2022) <https://pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=4279>.\n437\u2003 ESCWA Report, 37.\n438\u2003 Ibid ., 37-38.\n439\u2003 IMEU, \u2018Fact Sheet: Palestinian Citizens of Israel\u2019 (17 March 2021) <https://imeu.org/article/fact-\nsheet-palestinian-citizens-of-israel>.\n440\u2003 Ibid ., 4.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ112refused to allow discussion of the proposal.441\nIn the occupied Palestinian territory, there are some 3.19 million Palestinians \nin the West Bank, including 871,537 Palestinian refugees registered with \nUNRWA, and some 2.17 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, including \n1.47 million Palestinian refugees registered with UNRWA.442 Palestinians in \nthe occupied Palestinian territory are governed by Israeli military law, while \nJewish Israeli settlers, whose mere presence in the occupied Palestinian \nterritory is illegal, are subject to Israeli civil law. The latter is extended \nto the occupied territory in violation of the Israeli occupying authorities\u2019 \nresponsibilities under the Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions.443 \nZionist settler colonisation was supplemented within the occupied territory \nby a segregated legal system with different jurisdictions over Palestinians \nand Jewish settlers. This discrimination affects almost every aspect of \nPalestinian life under Israeli occupation.444\nPalestinian refugees and involuntary exiles make up the fourth \u2018domain\u2019 in \nwhich Israel has fragmented the Palestinian people.445 While they may find \nthemselves outside the territory under Israel\u2019s jurisdiction or territory of \neffective control, Israeli state policy in accordance with Zionist ideology denies \nthem their inalienable right of return as part of an institutionalised regime \nof systematic racial oppression and domination.

It maintains the Israeli state\u2019s Zionist \npolicy of population transfer and demographic manipulation on both sides \nof the Green Line and precludes all Palestinians from exercising their \ncollective right to self-determination. The 2017 ESCWA report concluded \nthat denial of the right of return of Palestinian refugees and exiles:\nensures that the Palestinian population never gains the \ndemographic weight that would either threaten Israeli military \ncontrol of the occupied Palestinian territory, or provide the \ndemographic leverage within Israel to allow them to insist on full \ndemocratic rights, which would supersede the Jewish character of \nthe State of Israel. In short, [it] ensures that Palestinians will never \nbe able to change the system\u2026455\nThe Palestinian people\u2019s inalienable right to self-determination is \ninternationally recognised and has been reaffirmed in countless UN General \nAssembly resolutions. As advocated for by the UN Special Rapporteur on \nPalestine, Francesca Albanese, its realisation requires a decolonisation \npraxis and paradigm shift as well as \u2018recognition of the absolute illegality of \nthe settler-colonialism and apartheid\u2019 imposed by the Israeli regime.456\n5.4.2   Restricting the Right to Freedom of Movement\nAs this section has highlighted, the Israeli regime has imposed draconian \nrestrictions on Palestinian residency rights, family life, sovereignty \nover natural resources as part of the right to self-determination, while \ndispossessing and displacing Palestinians from their land and properties. \nIntegral to the fragmentation of the Palestinian people are further \nrestrictions on movement and access varying across \u2018domains\u2019 of Israeli \ncontrol.

Within the occupied Palestinian \nterritory, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been subjected to a cruel \n15-year closure and blockade, which isolates them from the rest of the \nPalestinian people, denies them their right of return to their villages and \ntowns of origin, and has detrimentally impacted virtually every aspect of \ntheir life. Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are largely denied the right to travel \nto the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, the rest of historic Palestine, \nand abroad, through an Israeli-imposed permit regime. In addition to the \nblockade of the Gaza Strip, Palestinian communities across the occupied \nPalestinian territory and inside the Green Line are severed from one another \nthrough the Annexation Wall and its associated permit and closure regime, \nthe denial of family unification, and ongoing Israeli settlement construction \nand expansion.\nSome of the Israeli regime\u2019s measures for Palestinian dispossession \nand fragmentation are more visible than others, including the physical \nseparation of Palestinians between the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, \nJerusalem, inside the Green Line, and in exile. In the occupied Palestinian \nterritory, the Israeli occupying authorities have established checkpoints, \nroadblocks, and other barriers, which severely impact the freedom of \nmovement of Palestinians, denying them access to essential services, \nincluding healthcare in Jerusalem, Israel, and abroad, and access to places \nof worship in Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and elsewhere. In 2004, \nthe ICJ determined that the Annexation Wall and its associated regime \nviolate Israel\u2019s obligation to realise the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-\ndetermination.457 Despite this, Israel has not halted its construction of \nthe Annexation Wall, which remains standing and continues to result in \nmaterial discrimination against Palestinians, including the appropriation \n457\u2003 Wall Opinion, paras 122 and 151.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ116of Palestinian land for illegal Israeli settlement construction and \nexpansion.458\nAt the same time, the Israeli regime has also imposed less visible measures \ndesigned to fragment the Palestinian people and to undermine the exercise \nof their inalienable rights, notably through its control of the population \nregistry on both sides of the Green Line, its implementation of a tiered \nand racially discriminatory ID system, its denial of Palestinian family \nunification, and its control over who is allowed to enter and exit the \noccupied Palestinian territory.459 These restrictions have also resulted in \nextreme hardships for foreign national spouses, including Palestinians with \nforeign citizenship status, who are married to Palestinians with West Bank, \nGaza Strip, or Jerusalem IDs, including those who live without Israeli-issued \npermits, in constant fear of arrest and expulsion.460 Israel\u2019s fragmentation \nof the Palestinian people, including denial of Palestinian refugee return \nand restrictions on freedom of movement and residence across historic \nPalestine, constitute core methods of its apartheid regime.461\n458\u2003 CERD Report, 4.\n459\u2003 Al-Haq, Engineering Community: Family Uni\ufb01cation, Entry Restrictions and other Israeli Policies of \nFragmenting Palestinians  (February 2019) 4, <http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6106.html>.\n460\u2003 Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967, John Dugard, 29 January 2007, UN Doc A/HRC/4/17, \npara 48.\n461\u2003 This is also the analysis adopted by Falk and Tilley in the ESCWA Report.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Apartheid Legal Regime\nAL-HAQ1175.4.3  A Palestinian Bantustan: The Closure and Blockade of the \nGaza Strip\nThe Israeli occupying authorities have imposed a land, sea, and air \nblockade, and comprehensive closure of the Gaza Strip as collective \npunishment since 2007, detrimentally impacting the entire population of \nover two million Palestinians. In November 2021, the Gaza-based Al Mezan \nCenter for Human Rights published its report titled The Gaza Bantustan: \nIsraeli Apartheid in the Gaza Strip. The report showed that the Israeli \nclosure of the Gaza Strip, unprecedented in its duration and severity, has \n\u2018isolated, segregated, and cut off the two million Palestinians in Gaza,\u2019 \napproximately 70 per cent of whom are Palestinian refugees from 1948, \nfrom the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, historic Palestine, \nand the world, \u2018making it one of the world\u2019s largest \u201copen air prisons\u201d \nand a Bantustan.\u2019462 The Israeli occupying forces\u2019 recurring full-scale \nmilitary assaults, de-development policies, and 15 years of illegal closure \nand blockade \u2018have undermined all social, economic, cultural, civil, and \npolitical rights\u2019 of Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip, forcing over two \nmillion Palestinians into \u2018profound levels of poverty, aid dependency, food \ninsecurity, and unemployment, and\u2026 [causing] the collapse of essential \npublic services, including health care and water, sanitation, and hygiene.\u2019463 \nThe former UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine, John Dugard, noted in an \ninterview with Al Mezan that the Israeli occupying authorities\u2019 policies \ntargeting Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are far more severe than what was \nexperienced in South African Bantustans, saying:\nThe Israeli government is determined to impoverish the people \nof Gaza rather than to advance their welfare. The Bantustans did \nnot have to endure military attacks as we have seen in the Gaza \nStrip. The restrictions on freedom  of movement imposed on the \nGaza Strip are much more draconian than were experienced in \nBantustans.464\n462\u2003 Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, The Gaza Bantustan: Israeli Apartheid in the Gaza Strip (2021) \n18 <http://mezan.org/en/uploads/files/16381763051929.pdf>.\n463\u2003 Ibid ., 21\n464\u2003 Ibid ., 23.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ118The illegal Israeli blockade and closure regime amount to a prohibited form \nof collective punishment465 as recognised by, among others, former UN \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon466 and the  International Committee of the \nRed Cross (ICRC).467 In his July 2020 report, the former Special Rapporteur \non Palestine, Michael Lynk, found that \u2018the actions of Israel towards the \nprotected population of Gaza amount to collective punishment under \ninternational law.\u2019468 The term \u2018closure\u2019 denotes the list of Israeli policies \nand practices beyond blockade measures that collectively amount to \neffective control and, therefore, occupation of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli \noccupying authorities. These restrictions and enforcements include Israeli \nadministrative control over the population registry, telecommunications, \nwater, sanitation, and fuel. Moreover, the frequent presence of Israeli \noccupying forces inside the Gaza Strip to conduct incursions and military \noperations shows the Israeli regime\u2019s ability to enter the territory at will.469\nThe deliberate Israeli policy of separation and fragmentation of the \noccupied Palestinian territory and of the Palestinian people ensure that the \nPalestinian government remains divided, the Palestinian people are without \neffective representation, and that the Israeli regime has more leeway in \ncolonising historic Palestine. Both physical and political separation are key \nto enforcing a scheme that prevents the Palestinian people from exercising \ntheir right to self-determination.

Among the policies and practices \ndiscussed in this section are excessive use of force, including extrajudicial \nexecutions, arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, collective \npunishment, and the denial of the rights to health and dignity, including \nunderlying determinants. This section concludes with a discussion of Israeli \nmeasures of persecution and silencing of individuals and organisations \nopposing the apartheid regime, including the targeting and criminalisation \nof Palestinian civil society organisations.

Extrajudicial \nkillings are perpetuated by a system of impunity, which shields Israeli \nperpetrators from accountability.482\nDuring the Nakba of 1948, it is estimated that some 15,000 Palestinians \nwere killed by Zionist militias483 who committed at least 31 massacres \nagainst Palestinians.484 These included the massacre of over a hundred \nPalestinians in Deir Yassin in the Jerusalem district on 9 April 1948 in an \neffort to \u2018break Arab morale\u2019 and \u2018create panic throughout Palestine.\u2019485 \nOn 15 May 1948, Zionist militias massacred 200 Palestinians in Tantura \nin the Haifa district, and on 29 October 1948, Israeli soldiers entered the \nvillage of Dawayma in the Hebron district, killing up to 300 Palestinians.486 \nIn the immediate aftermath of the Nakba, Israeli authorities imposed \nmilitary rule on some 150,000 Palestinians inside the Green Line, \nincluding internally displaced Palestinians, with the aim of preventing \n481\u2003 UN OCHA, Escalation in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #2 as of 18:00, 8 August \n2022 (8 August 2022) <https://www.ochaopt.org/content/escalation-gaza-strip-and-israel-\nflash-update-2-august-2022?_gl=1*x1cee4*_ga*ODY1ODc5Mzk3LjE2NjY5NTM4NzU.*_ga_\nE60ZNX2F68*MTY2ODYxODkwOS44LjEuMTY2ODYxODkzMS4zOC4wLjA.>.\n482\u2003 See, for example, Al-Haq, Impunity for Extrajudicial Killing: Israeli Soldier and Killer of Abdel \nFattah Al-Sharif Released after Mere 9 Months in Prison (11 May 2018) <https://www.alhaq.org/\nadvocacy/6225.html>.\n483\u2003 See, for example, Al Jazeera, \u2018The Nakba did not start or end in 1948\u2019 (23 May 2017) <https://www.\naljazeera.com/features/2017/5/23/the-nakba-did-not-start-or-end-in-1948>.\n484\u2003 Papp\u00e9, The ethnic cleansing of Palestine, 258;

On Yawm al-Ard (or Land Day) on 30 March 1976, Palestinian \ncitizens inside the Green Line organised a general strike in protest of the \nIsraeli government\u2019s approval of a plan to expropriate 21,000 dunams of \nPalestinian land in the Galilee and the Triangle areas.495 The Yawm al-\nArd demonstrations, now commemorated annually in Palestine and by \nPalestinians in exile, were violently suppressed by the Israeli police at the \ntime, who killed six Palestinian citizens, injured 50 others, and arrested \n300 Palestinians protesting the plan to illegally confiscate their lands.496 \nSuch repression is illustrative of how Israeli apartheid policies are aimed \nat furthering Zionist colonisation.\nThe Israeli occupying authorities\u2019 suppression of Palestinian protests was \nalso a prominent feature of the First Intifada, which began on 9 December \n1987, born out of \u2018twenty years of a regime designed to suppress, \nhumiliate, and perpetually disenfranchise Palestinians\u2019 and the Israeli \nregime\u2019s continued efforts to eliminate the Palestinian national movement \nin exile.497 During the First Intifada, the Israeli occupying forces pursued \nan assassination policy against Palestinian activists.498 Israeli repression of \nthe Palestinian Intifada and mass extrajudicial executions of Palestinians, as \nEdward Said put it, were \u2018part of an orchestrated campaign to exterminate \nPalestinians as a political presence in Palestine.\u2019499 Between 1988 and 1993, \nIsraeli forces killed over 1,200 Palestinians, including 200 youth under the \n494\u2003 Article II(c), Apartheid Convention.\n495\u2003 Khalil Nakhleh, \u2018Yawm al-Ard (Land Day)\u2019 in Nadim N Rouhana and Areej Sabbagh-Khoury (eds), \nThe Palestinians in Israel: Readings in History, Politics and Society (Mada al-Carmel, 2011) 83, 84.\n496\u2003 Ibid .\n497\u2003 Edward Said, \u2018Intifada and Independence\u2019 (1989) 22 Social Text 23, 23 and 28.\n498\u2003 Al-Haq, Wilful Killing , 7.\n499\u2003 Said, \u2018Intifada and Independence\u2019 29.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ126age of 16.500 According to Al-Haq\u2019s documentation in the 1980s, the Israeli \noccupying forces \u2018opened fire directly at people.\u2019 Such incidents were \ndetermined to be \u2018not isolated,\u2019 illustrating \u2018consistent illegality by Israeli \narmy personnel in their use of force in response to demonstrations.\u2019501\nThe suppression of Palestinian protests continued during the Second \nIntifada, with an open Israeli acknowledgement of its policy of targeted \nkillings of Palestinians,502 aimed at suppressing the Intifada and thus \ndenying the exercise by Palestinians of their collective rights.503 At the time, \nAl-Haq found that \u2018[t]he decision to kill is seemingly taken by a cabal of \nintelligence officials and senior military and political figures who effectively \nact as judge, jury and executioner, which is completely at odds with due \nprocess procedures.\u2019504 In October 2000, Israeli police killed 13 unarmed \nPalestinians, including 12 Palestinian citizens and one resident of the Gaza \nStrip, during protests against Israeli oppression.505 An Israeli inquiry into \nthese killings, the Or Commission, found that there was no justification for \nthe use of live fire by the Israeli police. Yet, 22 years on, not a single Israeli \nofficer or official has been held accountable, a testament to Israeli impunity \nfor the arbitrary deprivation of Palestinian life.506\nIsrael\u2019s policy of excessive use of force against Palestinians remains ongoing, \nas evidenced by the Israeli occupying forces\u2019 systematic suppression of the \nGreat March of Return demonstrations in the Gaza Strip in 2018\u20132019.

Notably, the word \n\u2018including\u2019 in Article II(c) makes clear that the provision does not provide an \nexhaustive list of human rights violations, which may amount to inhuman \nacts of apartheid. Thus, the Apartheid Convention potentially encompasses \nthe denial of the full spectrum of human rights and fundamental freedoms \nas inhuman acts of apartheid, including the failure to ensure the full \nrealisation of economic, social, and cultural rights.558 Article 7(1)(k) of the \nRome Statute, in turn, codifies \u2018[o]ther inhumane acts of a similar character \nintentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental \nor physical health\u2019 as a crime against humanity and as inhumane acts of \napartheid within the meaning of Article 7(2)(h).\nThis part examines Israeli violations of the right to health to illustrate \nmeasures taken to prevent the full realisation of Palestinians\u2019 economic, \nsocial, and cultural rights.

The Rome Statute lists \u2018[i]mprisonment or other \nsevere deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of \ninternational law\u2019 as a crime against humanity under Article 7(1)(e), also \nconstituting an inhuman act of apartheid. With reference to the detention \nof Palestinians by the Israeli occupying forces, the UN Working Group on \nArbitrary Detention (WGAD) has considered detention to be arbitrary in \ncases when: (i) \u2018it is clearly impossible to invoke any legal basis justifying \nthe deprivation of liberty;\u2019 (ii) it is based on the exercise of fundamental \nrights and freedoms; (iii) the violation of fair trial rights \u2018is of such gravity \nas to give the deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character;\u2019 and (iv) when it \nis based on prohibited grounds of discrimination.673 As this part discusses, \nthese four instances apply to the Israeli regime\u2019s arbitrary detention and \nimprisonment policies targeting the Palestinian people.\nThe Israeli regime has consistently resorted to widespread arbitrary \ndetention of Palestinians both as a measure of collective punishment \nand to silence, intimidate, and undermine any resistance to its apartheid \nregime. An estimated 13,000 Palestinian children have been arrested by \nthe Israeli occupying forces in the West Bank since 2000, and some 500 \nto 700 Palestinian children are prosecuted in Israeli military courts each \nyear.674 As of October 2022, the Israeli regime continues to detain around \n4,700 Palestinian political prisoners and detainees across 17 prisons, four \ninterrogation centres, and four detention centres.675 Palestinian political \nprisoners detained in Israeli prisons include nine members of the Palestinian \nLegislative Council, 190 Palestinian children, and 30 women. Children as \nyoung as 14 have been placed under administrative detention by the Israeli \noccupying authorities and serve out their detention in the same facilities \n673\u2003 WGAD, Opinion No 8/2021 concerning Layan Kayed, Elyaa Abu Hijla and Ruba Asi (Israel), UN Doc \nA/HRC/WGAD/2021/8, 7 June 2021, para 3.\n674\u2003 DCI-Palestine, Factsheet: Palestinian Child Detainees (12 January 2022) <https://nwttac.dci-\npalestine.org/statistics_and_talking_points_palestinian_children_in_israeli_military_detention>.\n675\u2003 Addameer, Statistics (18 November 2022) <http://www.addameer.org/statistics>.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Policies to Maintain Apartheid\nAL-HAQ155as adults.676 Currently, 820 Palestinian administrative detainees, including \nfour children and three women continue to be detained indefinitely in \nIsraeli prisons without charge or trial.677 Former UN Special Rapporteur on \nPalestine, Michael Lynk, observed in 2020 that:\nAdministrative detention\u2026 allows a state to arrest and detain \na person without charges, without a trial, without knowing the \nevidence against her or him, and without a fair judicial review\u2026 It \nis a penal system that is ripe for abuse and maltreatment.678\nAlready in its 2012 concluding observations on Israel\u2019s report, CERD had \nraised concerns about the widespread use of administrative detention, \nin particular against Palestinian children, and the use of \u2018secret evidence\u2019 \nin Israeli military courts. The Committee recommended that the Israeli \nregime \u2018ensure equal access to justice for all persons residing in territories \nunder [its] effective control\u2019 and urged Israel \u2018to end its current practice of \nadministrative detention, which is discriminatory and constitutes arbitrary \ndetention under international human rights law.\u2019679\nThe frequency of the use of administrative detention as a method of \nsubjugation, intimidation, and control by the Israeli regime has fluctuated \nover the years. Since 1948, the Israeli regime has relied on arbitrary detention \nand imprisonment of Palestinians, notably of political leaders,680 but also \nof activists, human rights defenders, and others as collective punishment.681 \nIndefinite administrative detention without charge or trial is one of the many \naspects of the discriminatory Israeli judicial system.

In May 2021, Israeli \npolice launched \u2018Operation Law and Order\u2019 targeting Palestinian citizens, \nas a form of collective punishment for their participation in the Unity \nIntifada.684 This \u2018operation\u2019 led to mass arrests of Palestinian citizens in \norder to \u2018penalise those who have taken part in demonstrations against \nsettler violence, the Israeli forces\u2019 crackdown on the Al-Aqsa Mosque \ncompound, and the military\u2019s 11-day bombardment campaign of Gaza,\u2019 \nto entrench fragmentation and undermine Palestinian unity.685 In March \n2022, to undermine Palestinian resistance in the West Bank, the Israeli \noccupying forces launched \u2018Operation Break the Wave\u2019 as part of which the \nIsraeli military stated it has arrested over 1,500 Palestinians.686 Within the \nunderstanding of WGAD, these \u2018operations\u2019 are intended to undermine the \nexercise by the Palestinian people of their fundamental rights and freedoms, \nwith this exercise often forming the basis for arbitrary detentions in the \nfirst place.

Notably, the Israeli Military Commander \nexercises judicial, legislative, and executive functions. Palestinians may be \ndenied access to a lawyer for up to 60 days in the Israeli military court \nsystem as well as to interpreters and are subjected to a near-99 per cent \nconviction rate within military courts.687 In its November 2022 submission \nto the UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine, Francesca Albanese, Addameer \nhighlighted the racially discriminatory nature of the Israeli judicial system, \ncontrary to Articles 9 and 14(1) of the ICCPR and Article 3 of ICERD.688 \nNotably, with reference to Israeli Military Order 1651, which \u2018authorises\u2019 \nadministrative detention in the occupied West Bank, WGAD has found that \nthis practice \u2018is particularly directed against Palestinians.\u2019689\nIn 2011, Sahar Francis, General Director of Addameer, analysed the \nIsraeli policy of deprivation of liberty as an inhuman act of apartheid, \nconcluding that:\nIsrael\u2019s arrest and detention of Palestinians in the [occupied \nPalestinian territory] and within Israel proper is governed by a \nregime of laws and institutions almost completely separate from \nthe one administering the arrest of Jewish Israelis. Because this \nsystem enables the large-scale arbitrary arrest of Palestinians \nwhile generally affording them lower protections and guarantees \nthan Jewish Israelis, it should be understood as a discriminatory \ninstitutional tool of domination and oppression against them.690\nThus, Israeli authorities commit the inhuman(e) act of arbitrary detention \nand imprisonment against the Palestinian people, with the intention of \nmaintaining the regime.\n687\u2003 Addameer, Illegal and Arbitrary: The Deprivation of Liberty of Palestinians in Occupied Territories \n(10 November 2022) 3-5 <https://www.addameer.org/news/4928>.\n688\u2003 Ibid. , 5-6, 8, 15-16.\n689\u2003 Ibid.

The Israeli judicial \nsystem has repeatedly sanctioned the use of physical and psychological \ntorture and other forms of ill-treatment as \u2018interrogation\u2019 techniques that \nare systematically used against Palestinians.\nIsraeli authorities have resorted to systematic torture and ill-treatment \nagainst Palestinian detainees in violation of the absolute and non-derogable \nprohibition of torture.691 Affidavits and documented cases gathered by \nvarious human rights organisations, including Addameer, have shown that \nthe Israeli occupying authorities use torture as a core technique in extracting \nstatements from Palestinian detainees, in violation of their rights to bodily \nintegrity, physical safety, and dignity, doing so with legal cover provided \nby the Israeli courts.692 In 2016, the UN Committee against Torture, in its \nconcluding observations on Israel, expressed its concerns regarding:\nallegations of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment or punishment of persons deprived of liberty, including \nminors. According to these allegations, torture and ill-treatment \nare mostly perpetrated by law enforcement and security officials, \nmainly from the Israel Security Agency, the police and the Israeli \n[military], particularly during arrest, transfer and interrogation. \nIn addition, the Committee remains concerned at allegations \nthat Israel Security Agency interrogators continue to resort to \ninterrogation methods that are contrary to the Convention, such \nas stress positions and sleep deprivation.693\nTorture techniques, including physical pressure and methods of \npsychological torture, have been used since the beginning of the Israeli \n691\u2003 See, notably, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Customary International Humanitarian \nLaw Database, Rule 90, Torture and Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment <https://ihl-databases.\nicrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule90>; see also Article 32, Fourth Geneva Convention; \nArticle 7, ICCPR; Article 2(1), CAT.\n692\u2003 See International Human Rights Clinic, Harvard Law School, and Addameer, Apartheid in the \nOccupied West Bank, 18-19; Ardi Imseis, \u2018Moderate Torture on Trial: Critical Reflections on the \nIsraeli Supreme Court Judgement concerning the Legality of General Security Service Interrogation \nMethods\u2019 (2001) 19(2) Berkeley Journal of International Law 328.\n693\u2003 UN Committee against Torture, Concluding observations on the fifth periodic report of Israel, UN \nDoc CAT/C/ISR/CO/5, 3 June 2016, para 30.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Policies to Maintain Apartheid\nAL-HAQ159occupation and have become standard operating procedure.694 Examples \nof such techniques include physical beatings, stress positions, sleep \ndeprivation, isolation, and solitary confinement during interrogation, \nsubjection to sounds of torture from neighbouring cells, deliberate \nmedical neglect, screaming and cursing, threats of sexual harassment, \nparticularly against women and children, and threats of harming family \nmembers. Moreover, Addameer\u2019s documentation indicates that Israeli \noccupying authorities continue to develop new methods of psychological \ntorture that are used in conjunction with physical torture.695\nAccording to Defense for Children International\u2014Palestine (DCI-Palestine), \nthe majority of detained Palestinian children report being subjected to \nharsh interrogation techniques, amounting to torture and other cruel \nand inhuman treatment, to coerce them into self-incrimination through \nthe extraction of confessions.696 Another Israeli technique is the use of \ninformants to extract information from detainees by misleading, luring, or \nthreatening them. Informants exert psychological pressure by threatening \ndetainees and their family members with physical violence or harm.697 As \nAddameer has found, torture has been committed by the Israeli authorities \nsince 1948. In the most extreme cases, Palestinian detainees have died in \nIsraeli detention as a result.698 Finally, Addameer has highlighted:\nThe [Israeli] judicial and medical systems contribute in concealing \ncrimes of torture by often refraining from documenting the \ntorture Palestinian detainees endure, extending the detention \nof detainees for the purpose of interrogation in a complete \ndisregard of markings of torture littering their bodies, as well as \nperpetually certifying that detainees are medically fit to withstand \ninterrogation despite their pains and suffering.699\n694\u2003 Yara Hawari, \u2018The Systematic Torture of Palestinians in Israeli Detention\u2019 (Al Shabaka, 28 November \n2019) <https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/the-systematic-torture-of-palestinians-in-israeli-detention/>. \n695\u2003 Addameer, Cell 26: A Study on the Use of Torture against Palestinian Prisoners in Israeli Interrogation \nCenter  (13 June 2022) <https://www.addameer.org/media/4821>.\n696\u2003 DCI-Palestine, Youth Convection: Palestinian Children Describe Solitary Con \ufb01nement in Israeli Military \nPrisons (20 December 2014) <https://www.dci-palestine.org/bound_blindfolded_and_convicted>.\n697\u2003 CERD Report, para 128; Addameer, Cell No. 26 , 40-41.\n698\u2003 CERD Report, para 128; Addameer, Cell No. 26 , 48, 127.\n699\u2003 Addameer, Cell No. 26, 48, 127; Derek Summerfield, \u2018The campaign about doctors and torture \nin Israel five years on\u2019 (2014) 349 The BMJ <https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g4386>; see \nalso Sharmila Devi, \u2018Israeli doctors accused of collusion in torture\u2019 (2013) 381(9869) The Lancet \n<https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60612-1/fulltext#%20>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ1606.5   Collective Punishment\nCollective punishment has been a staple of Israel\u2019s apartheid regime and \nprolonged 55-year military occupation, in a continuation of the colonial \ntactics of the British mandate. Collective punishment, that is the punishment \nof an individual for \u2018an offence he or she has not personally committed,\u2019 \nis expressly prohibited under international humanitarian law as set out in \nArticle 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.700 Israeli authorities utilise a \nrange of such policies and practices to collectively punish the Palestinian \npeople, with damaging effects on Palestinian families and communities.\nIn the occupied West Bank, including the eastern part of Jerusalem, Israeli \noccupying authorities carry out home demolitions and sealings of homes \nto collectively punish Palestinians. Such demolitions and sealings are \ncarried out with reference to the sweeping permissions provided for under \nRegulation 119 of the 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations inherited \nfrom the British mandate system. Under this regulation, the Military \nCommander may forfeit, seal off, or destroy the property of individuals \nwhom he suspects of having allegedly committed acts of violence against \nthe state; this practice has also been directed against the family members \nof those accused of carrying out alleged attacks, as well as their immediate \nneighbours.701 Punitive house demolitions and the threat thereof serve \nto punish entire Palestinian families and communities based wholly on \nallegations from the Israeli authorities.\nA particularly disturbing form of collective punishment used by the Israeli \noccupying authorities is that of withholding the bodies of Palestinians killed \nby the occupying forces. As discussed earlier, a common policy of Israeli \nmilitary operations throughout the occupied Palestinian territory is the \nuse of excessive, disproportionate, and unnecessary lethal force, executed \nthrough a shoot-to-kill policy amounting to an official practice of unlawful and \nextrajudicial killing. Following such operations, the Israeli occupying forces \nmay withhold the bodies of deceased Palestinians and obstruct the collection \nof information and evidence, thereby frustrating attempts to investigate and \nascertain the exact circumstances of the killings. Many of the bodies withheld \n700\u2003 Article 33, Fourth Geneva Convention; Article 50, Hague Regulations. \n701\u2003 See Al-Haq, Punitive House Demolitions (31 October 2015) <https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6475.\nhtml>.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Policies to Maintain Apartheid\nAL-HAQ161are buried in \u2018cemeteries of numbers,\u2019 effectively anonymous mass graves, in \nundisclosed locations without identification markers.702 The total number of \nsuch cases is unknown; however according to Palestinian civil society, as of \nthe end of May 2020, at least 62 bodies of deceased Palestinians were being \nwithheld by the Israeli occupying authorities in addition to those buried in \nthe cemeteries of numbers.703 The withholding of bodies is a particularly cruel \npolicy by the Israeli regime and violates a range of Palestinians\u2019 fundamental \nrights and freedoms. In 2020, the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights \nCenter, Al-Haq, and the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies submitted to \nthe UN special procedures that:\nIsrael\u2019s refusal to repatriate the mortal remains of indigenous \nPalestinians violates, inter alia, Article 12(2) of the UN Declaration \non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It also contravenes the \ncustomary [international humanitarian law] rules on the disposal \nof the War Dead\u2019s bodies as well as the human rights to dignity, \nfamily life, religious freedom and cultural customs, and the \nprohibition against degrading or inhuman treatment.704\nThe 15-year Israeli closure of the Gaza Strip stands as one of the most notable \nexamples of collective punishment targeting the Palestinian people. As held \nby the ICRC: \u2018[t]he whole of Gaza\u2019s civilian population is being punished for \nacts for which they bear no responsibility. The closure therefore constitutes \na collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel\u2019s obligations \nunder international humanitarian law.\u2019705 Former UN Special Rapporteur on \nPalestine, Michael Lynk, similarly highlighted that: \n702\u2003 See Al-Haq, Human Rights Groups Submit to UN experts on the Israeli policy of withholding the \nmortal remains of indigenous Palestinians (27 June 2020) <https://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/17033.\nhtml>. \n703\u2003 JLAC, Al-Haq, and CIHRS, Joint submission to EMRIP and UN experts on the Israeli policy of withholding \nthe mortal remains of indigenous Palestinians: Response to Call for Inputs: Comments on the Study \non the Right to Land under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Report \non the Right to Repatriation of ceremonial objects, human remains, and intangible properties under \nthe UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (22 June 2020) 5 <https://www.alhaq.\norg/cached_uploads/download/2020/06/27/200622-joint-submission-on-the-israeli-policy-of-\nwithholding-the-mortal-remains-of-indigenous-palestinians-22-june-2020-final-1593240783.pdf>; \nsee also UN General Assembly, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in \nthe Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (22 December 2020) UN Doc A/HRC/44/60, para 72.\n704\u2003 JLAC, Al-Haq, and CIHRS, Joint submission to EMRIP and UN experts, 2.\n705\u2003 ICRC, Gaza Closure: Not Another Year!

While collective punishment is not specifically \nincluded as an inhuman act within either the Apartheid Convention or the \nRome Statute, the discrete policies and practices underlying Israel\u2019s broader \npolicy of collective punishment, not limited to those described above, \nfall under the \u2018inhuman acts\u2019 as described in Article II of the Convention \nand the \u2018inhumane acts\u2019 listed in Article 7 of the Rome Statute. Through \nsuch policies, the Israeli regime inflicts serious bodily and mental harm on \nPalestinians and prevents their exercise of political, social, economic, civil, \nand cultural rights.\n706\u2003 UN Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967 (15 July 2020) UN Doc A/44/60, para 57.\n707\u2003 Al Mezan, The Gaza Bantustan, 47.\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Policies to Maintain Apartheid\nAL-HAQ1636.6  Persecution and Silencing of Opposition to Apartheid\nUnder Article II(f) of the Apartheid Convention, the \u2018[p]ersecution of \norganizations and persons, by depriving them of fundamental rights and \nfreedoms, because they oppose apartheid\u2019 is considered an inhuman act of \nthe crime of apartheid. The Rome Statute does not replicate this provision. \nThe Israeli authorities have long pursued a campaign of intimidation, \nharassment, and delegitimisation of human rights defenders and human \nrights and civil society organisations calling for justice and accountability \nfor Israel\u2019s widespread and systematic human rights violations.\nThe Israeli government, through its former Strategic Affairs Ministry, which \nhas since been merged into the Foreign Affairs Ministry, and affiliated groups, \ncarries out ongoing, systematic, and organised attacks amounting to a \nconcerted smear campaign against human rights defenders and organisations \nadvocating for the rights of the Palestinian people. This is done through, \ninter alia, incitement to racial hatred and violence, character assassinations, \ndefamation, seeking to brand Palestinian human rights defenders as \n\u2018terrorists,\u2019 and exerting direct attacks and raids on human organisations and \ntheir resources to undermine\u2014and eventually halt\u2014their human rights and \naccountability work, and with the goal of impeding the granting and award of \nfunds from international donors to Palestinian organisations.708\nPalestinian human rights organisations seeking international accountability \nfor suspected Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity have been \nspecifically targeted by Israeli state-led smear campaigns. They have \nexperienced attacks against staff members, including death threats against \nthemselves and their families as a direct result of their work at the ICC.

In September 2020, Salah Hammouri, Palestinian-\nFrench human rights defender and lawyer at Addameer, was notified by \nIsraeli occupying authorities of their intention to revoke his permanent \nresidency status in Jerusalem, the city where he was born, for so-called \n\u2018breach of allegiance\u2019 to the Occupying Power.713 On 18 October 2021, \nthe Israeli Interior Minister announced the official revocation of Salah\u2019s \nJerusalem residency status.

accordingly, \nthe assumption of unlawful power through illegitimate means may not be \nrecognised by the international community, which may include \u2018sovereign \ntitle to annexed territory, lawful condonation of its practices of racial \ndiscrimination or apartheid, or legal acceptance of its denial of self-\ndetermination through its sustained defiance and the passage of time.\u2019720 \nStates must ensure that they do not contribute toward the maintenance \nof this regime, either directly or indirectly, including through private and \ncorporate entities domiciled within their territory,721 and through their \nrelationships with local and regional authorities.722 Finally, states must \ntake positive actions to bring the unlawful situation to an end, which \nshould include measures such as economic sanctions.723\nIn the commentaries to the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial \nObligations of States in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,724 \nit is noted, in the context of Principle 9(b) that \u2018the obligations of a state \nunder international human rights law may effectively be triggered when \nits responsible authorities know or should have known the conduct of the \n719\u2003 UN General Assembly, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967, Michael Lynk (21 October 2019), UN Doc A/74/507, \npara 47.\n720\u2003 Ibid ., para 48.\n721\u2003 Marya Farah, Business and Human Rights in Occupied Territory, 79-80. \n722\u2003 On this, see Al-Haq, Al-Haq Submits Legal Position Paper to European Union on the Membership of \nMr Haim Bibas, Mayor of Modi\u2019in-Maccabim-Re\u2019ut, in the Euro-Mediterranean Regional and Local \nAssembly (ARLEM) (2 March 2020) <http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/16547.html>. \n723\u2003 Al-Haq, Al-Haq Response to \u2018Regulation\u2019 Bill: Time for Actions, Time for Sanctions (7 February \n2017) <http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/6357.html>;

Such a link of jurisdiction may be established\u2026 on the \nbasis of: (a) the effective capacity of the State to regulate the \nactivities of the businesses concerned and (b) the actual knowledge \nthat the State had of those activities and their necessary and \nforeseeable consequences in terms of violations of human rights \nrecognized in the Covenant.726\nThese obligations, in conjunction with those of third state responsibility,727 \nfurther extend to states\u2019 roles as members of international organisations:\nAs a member of an international organisation, the State remains \nresponsible for its own conduct in relation to its human rights \nobligations within its territory and extraterritorially. A State that \ntransfers competences to, or participates in, an international \norganisation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the \nrelevant organisation acts consistently with the international \nhuman rights obligations of that State.728\nThus, a state\u2019s extraterritorial obligations as a member of an international \norganisation under the Maastricht Principles are closely aligned with \nthose under the 2011 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International \n725\u2003 Olivier De Schutter, Asbj\u00f8rn Eide, Ashfaq Khalfan, Marcos Orellana, Margot Salomon and Ian \nSeiderman, \u2018Commentary to the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the \nArea of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\u2019 (2012) 34 Human Rights Quarterly 1109 (hereinafter \nthe \u2018Maastricht Commentary\u2019).\n726\u2003 UN Human Rights Committee, Decision adopted by the Committee under article 5(3) of the Optional \nProtocol, concerning communication No. 2285/2013: Concurring opinion of Committee members \nOlivier de Frouville and Yadh Ben Achour,  7 December 2017, UN Doc CCPR/C/120/D/2285/2013, \npara 10.\n727\u2003 See Principle 11, Maastricht Principles .\n728\u2003 Principle 15, Maastricht Principles .\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ170Organizations:\nA State member of an international organization incurs international \nresponsibility if, by taking advantage of the fact that the organization \nhas competence in relation to the subject-matter of one of the \nState\u2019s international obligations, it circumvents that obligation by \ncausing the organization to commit an act that, if committed by the \nState, would have constituted a breach of the obligation.729\nStates have a positive obligation, particularly arising from the ICCPR and \nICESCR, which encompass the right to self-determination, to ensure that \ntheir acts and omissions do not result in breaches of their human rights \nobligations to respect and protect self-determination in foreign territories, \nincluding through their actions in international and regional organisations. \nRead in parallel with analogous obligations under the law of state \nresponsibility, it is abundantly clear that states must take active measures \nto ensure that they do not contribute, both in their own individual acts or \nomissions or those done in their capacity as member states of institutions \nsuch as the EU or UN, toward the violations of the rights of the Palestinian \npeople, and the continued maintenance of an apartheid regime, which \nsystematically violates the gamut of human rights enshrined under the \nICCPR and ICESCR. Nonetheless, many third states have systematically \nfailed in this regard.\n729\u2003 Article 61, Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations (2011); Maastricht \nCommentary, 1120.\n\n\nResponsibility and Accountability for Israel\u2019s Apartheid Regime\nAL-HAQ1717.2  Universal Jurisdiction\nUniversal jurisdiction provides an important legal avenue to challenge \nIsrael\u2019s pervasive impunity for its apartheid regime and other suspected \ninternational crimes. Despite the legal obligation for third states to \ntry suspected perpetrators of grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva \nConvention under Article 146, the obligation to try those suspected of \ntorture under CAT,730 and of the crime of apartheid under the Apartheid \nConvention,731 the activation of universal jurisdiction mechanisms has \nbeen undermined through politicisation, particularly in the context of \nIsraeli conduct. Palestinian organisations and claimants who have sought \njustice through such mechanisms have been accused of \u2018forum-shopping,\u2019 \npainting their use of the doctrine as illegitimate, and frustrating the \npursuit of genuine and effective accountability.732 While the ICC is an \nimportant avenue for international accountability for suspected crimes \ncommitted in Palestine, its jurisdiction is limited only to alleged crimes \ncommitted since 13 June 2014 in the occupied Palestinian territory and to \nthose crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute. In this context, universal \njurisdiction remains a potent avenue for the pursuit of international \naccountability for international crimes, including the crime of apartheid, \nand related widespread and systematic human rights violations targeting \nthe Palestinian people as a whole.733\n730\u2003 Article 5(2), CAT.\n731\u2003 Article 4(b), Apartheid Convention.\n732\u2003 See Bil\u2019In (Village Council) v.

Facilitated through the aligned interests \nof maintaining the existing regime of domination, exploitation, and \nprofit,745 corporate entities, financial institutions, and non-governmental \norganisations, including registered non-profits and charities, have \ncontributed to, inter alia, the continued economic subjugation and \ndisplacement of Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory and the \nappropriation of refugee property within the Green Line.746 As noted in \nthe report of the Don\u2019t Buy Into Occupation (DBIO) Coalition: \n[w]hile the State of Israel has played a key role in advancing \nthe construction and expansion of settlements in the occupied \nWest Bank and Jerusalem, their maintenance and growth would \nnot have been possible without private actors, including non-\nprofits such as the Jewish National Fund, the World Zionist \nOrganisation, and the Israel Land Fund, as well as Israeli and \nmultinational business enterprises.747 \nMoreover, corporate activities conducted at the expense of the rights \nof the Palestinian people, on both sides of the Green Line, have served \nto normalise Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime and undermine \nthe realisation of the rights of the Palestinian people, including to self-\ndetermination, permanent sovereignty, and the right of return.748\n745\u2003 See Pearce Clancy, \u2018Corporate Capture and Solidarity during Occupation: The Case of the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory\u2019 (Business and Human Rights Journal Blog,  20 February 2020) <https://www.\ncambridge.org/core/blog/2020/02/20/corporate-capture-and-solidarity-during-occupation-the-\ncase-of-the-occupied-palestinian-territory/>.\n746\u2003 On this, see WhoProfits, Pro\ufb01ting through Dispossession: Another Side of Airbnb\u2019s Complicity \n(October 2019) <https://www.whoprofits.org/updates/airbnbs-complicity-in-the-plunder-of-\npalestinian-refugee-properties/>.\n747\u2003 Al-Haq, Don\u2019t Buy into Occupation: Exposing the \ufb01nancial flows into illegal Israeli settlements (30 \nSeptember 2021) 25 <https://www.alhaq.org/publications/18870.html>.\n748\u2003 On the corporate profiting of the denial of the right of return beyond the Green Line, see Who \nProfits, Pro\ufb01ting Through Dispossession .\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ174Among other activities, by continuing to allow trade with illegal Israeli \nsettlements in the occupied West Bank, including the eastern part of \nJerusalem, exploiting appropriated Palestinian refugee property, and \nfailing to prevent business enterprises domiciled in their territories and/\nor jurisdiction from respecting international law, states are acting in direct \nviolation of the principle of non-maintenance of unlawful situations.749\nAs with the commission of international crimes by Israeli state agents, \nactivating and incorporating domestic legislation to give effect to universal \njurisdiction as a means to pursue accountability for private actors, \nincluding corporate entities and \u2018charities,\u2019 is key, particularly considering \nthe countless documented cases of their sustained involvement in grave \nbreaches and internationally recognised crimes.750 This mechanism and \nprinciple should therefore be activated, including in relation to companies \nthat are listed in the UN Database of businesses involved in illegal Israeli \nsettlements, as well as others that commit, or are otherwise involved in, \nserious breaches of international law, including the crime of apartheid, on \nboth sides of the Green Line.\n749\u2003 Article 41(2), Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n750\u2003 See, for example, Al-Haq and SOMO, Violations Set in Stone: HeidelbergCement in the Occupied \nPalestinian Territory (4 February 2020) <http://www.alhaq.org/publications/16408.html>;

OHCHR \nwarned in 2018 that:\nConsidering the weight of the international legal consensus \nconcerning the illegal nature of the settlements themselves, as laid \nout in Human Rights Council resolution 31/36, and the systemic \nand pervasive nature of the negative human rights impact caused \nby them, the report notes that \u201cit is difficult to imagine a scenario \n751\u2003 UN Human Rights Council Resolution 31/36 (20 April 2016) UN Doc A/HRC/RES/31/36, para 17.\n752\u2003 UN Human Rights Council, Report of the independent international fact-finding mission to \ninvestigate the implications of the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and \ncultural rights of the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including \nEast Jerusalem (7 February 2013) UN Doc A/HRC/22/63, para 96.\n753\u2003 Ibid ., para 96.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ176in which a company could engage in listed activities in a way that \nis consistent with the [UN] Guiding Principles [on Business and \nHuman Rights] and international law.\u201d754\nGiven the sweeping nature of Israel\u2019s institutionalised regime of racial \ndomination and oppression, it is similarly unlikely that businesses and \ncorporate entities can responsibly engage with illegal Israeli settler \ncolonisation without being complicit in the international wrong and \ncrime of apartheid, on whichever side of the Green Line their activities \nmay take place.\nThe UN Database\u2019s delayed publication in February 2020 lists 112 Israeli \nand multinational corporate enterprises out of the 321 reviewed in the \nprocess.755 While the list is limited and does not reflect the full picture of \ncorporate involvement in Israel\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise, the Database \nprovides a stark illustration of corporate involvement in Israel\u2019s apartheid \nregime, and the corporate contributions toward the regime\u2019s maintenance \nand normalisation as well as its human rights violations. Despite the \nongoing delay of the mandated annual updating of the Database, it has had \nan impact on driving corporate entities to end their involvement in or with \nIsrael\u2019s illegal settlement enterprise, such as the Norwegian KLP pension \nfund756 and Ben & Jerry\u2019s Homemade Holdings Inc.757 The maintenance \nand annual updating of the Database is integral to ending the economic \nincentives for private actors that help maintain and expand Israel\u2019s illegal \nsettlement enterprise, which represents a key manifestation of Israel\u2019s \napartheid regime.\n754\u2003 UN OHCHR, UN rights office issues report on business and human rights in settlements in the occupied \nPalestinian territory (31 January 2018) <https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2018/01/un-\nrights-office-issues-report-business-and-human-rights-settlements>. \n755\u2003 UN Human Rights Council, Database of all business enterprises involved in the activities detailed in \nparagraph 96 of the independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the implications \nof the Israeli settlements on the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian \npeople throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem (12 February 2020) \nUN Doc A/HRC/43/71.\n756\u2003 Reuters, \u2018Nordic fund KLP excludes 16 companies over links with occupied West Bank\u2019 (5 July 2021) \n<https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/nordic-fund-klp-excludes-16-companies-over-\nlinks-with-occupied-west-bank-2021-07-05/>.\n757\u2003 Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Ben & Jerry\u2019s Will End Sales of Our Ice Cream in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (19 \nJuly 2021) <https://www.benjerry.com/about-us/media-center/opt-statement>.\n\n\nResponsibility and Accountability for Israel\u2019s Apartheid Regime\nAL-HAQ177For Israel\u2019s apartheid regime to be meaningfully challenged, states must \ntake serious steps based on information made available through the \nDatabase and other credible sources, including those made available by \ncivil society. This includes providing political and financial support for the \nannual updating of the Database to provide a comprehensive list of all \nbusiness entities involved in Israel\u2019s unlawful settlement enterprise. Despite \nits limitations, the Database provides a stark illustration of corporate \ninvolvement in Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime, and the extent \nof corporate involvement in maintaining and normalising this regime and \nassociated human rights violations.\nMoreover, mandatory labelling758 guidelines for settlement products \npursued by a number of states have proven ineffective at deterring the \nselling of settlement products and services. Therefore, it is important that \nstates prohibit trade with Israel\u2019s unlawful settlements, ban settlement \ngoods and services from their markets, and impose economic sanctions \nto challenge the corporate incentives linked to Israel\u2019s apartheid regime, \npopulation transfer, and settler colonialism on both sides of the Green \nLine. In this vein, in September 2021, a European citizen-led initiative was \nregistered with the European Commission, and later launched in February \n2022, calling for legislation to prohibit products originating from illegal \nsettlements, including those in Palestine, from entering the EU market and \nto ban EU exports to them.759\n758\u2003 Al-Haq, EU Takes a Step Forward with CJEU Ruling in Favour of Accurate Labelling (19 December \n2019) <http://www.alhaq.org/advocacy/16316.html>; Al-Haq, Al-Haq Welcomes Advocate General \nHogan\u2019s CJEU Opinion Explicitly Requiring Labelling of Settlement Goods, but calls on States and \nthe EU to Prohibit the Import of Illegal Settlement Goods (4 July 2019) <http://www.alhaq.org/\nadvocacy/14485.html>. \n759\u2003 See < https://stopsettlements.org/>.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ1787.6  UN Anti-Apartheid Mechanisms\nThe UN and the international community played a central role in supporting \nSouth African, Namibian, and international activists and civil society toward \nbringing the South African apartheid regime to an end. The establishment \nof the UN Special Committee against Apartheid (the Special Committee) \nand the UN Centre against Apartheid (the Centre) were key tools in the \nanti-apartheid struggle.760 In 1962, the UN General Assembly established \nthe Special Committee to \u2018keep the racial policies of the Government of \nSouth Africa under review\u2019 and to report to the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council.761 The Special Committee promoted the international \ncampaign against apartheid and worked to build support for international \ncollective action,762 while legitimising calls for boycotts, divestment, and \nsanctions against the apartheid regime.763 In 1976, the Centre was created \nunder the auspices of the Special Committee to coordinate UN anti-\napartheid activities.764 The Centre reported on third state compliance with \ninternational law and countermeasures such as the arms embargo,765 and \notherwise assisted the anti-apartheid movement.766\nOn 17 March 2021, Namibia became the first state at the UN Human Rights \nCouncil to publicly call for the reconstitution of the Special Committee to \naddress Israeli apartheid policies and practices.

This is not a new reality but the continuation of decades \nof settler colonialism, ongoing Nakba, and apartheid. The international law \nframework prohibiting apartheid offers avenues to punish perpetrators \nof the crime, whether in the courts of third states through the principle of \nuniversal jurisdiction or at the ICC. It requires third states not to recognise \nthe unlawful situation resulting from Israeli apartheid, not to aid or assist \nin its maintenance, and to cooperate to bring Israeli apartheid to an end. \nThese obligations are enshrined in the Apartheid Convention and, more \nbroadly, in the law of state responsibility. While these obligations are also \ncontained in international humanitarian law provisions, up to this date, they \nhave not been enforced to hold Israeli authorities to account. Moreover, \ntheir scope has largely been limited to the occupied Palestinian territory, \nmaintaining the fragmentation of the Palestinian people. Unlike the previous \napproaches, a comprehensive apartheid framework allows us to overcome \nthe fragmentation of the Palestinian people in law and in practice.\u00a9 Activestills\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ182Successive condemnations by the UN General Assembly and Security \nCouncil, the establishment of UN anti-apartheid mechanisms, and the \nadoption of effective measures cumulatively contributed to the international \ncommunity\u2019s efforts to suppress and eradicate the crime of apartheid in South \nAfrica and occupied Namibia. Political will played a central role in advancing \ndecolonisation in this process. Only through such concerted action, including \nadoption of coercive measures by third states, can a similar effort be led \ntoward dismantling the Israeli settler colonial apartheid regime.\nImportantly, Israel\u2019s institutionalised regime of racial domination and \noppression over the Palestinian people as a whole cannot be understood \nnor dismantled without an appreciation of its settler colonial character. \nThe dismantlement of Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime must \ninvolve a decolonisation praxis toward the dismantlement of all structures \nof domination, exploitation, and oppression and the realisation of the \nPalestinian people\u2019s inalienable rights, including to return to their homes, \nlands, and properties, as provided for under international law. The right \nof return, and the dismantlement of the Israeli settler colonial apartheid \nregime are essential to realising the collective right of the Palestinian \npeople to self-determination.\nIt is for the Palestinian people to reclaim their agency and to pave the way \ntoward a future of justice, dignity, self-determination, return, and liberation. \nWe hope that this report has done justice to the decades of tireless work by \nPalestinian activists and organisers on the ground, who have advanced our \nunderstanding of the root causes of Palestinian oppression.\n\n\nRecommendations\nAL-HAQ183\n9Recommendations\n9.1  To All States\n1. Recognise and condemn, including through regional and \ninternational organisations and fora, that Israel\u2019s discriminatory \nlaws, policies, and practices have cumulatively established and \ncontinue to maintain an apartheid regime of systemic racial \noppression and domination over the Palestinian people as a \nwhole, as part of the Zionist settler colonial project, using strategic \nfragmentation as its primary tool, giving rise to individual criminal \nresponsibility in addition to engaging Israel\u2019s state responsibility \nfor internationally wrongful acts;\n2. Uphold the Namibia Doctrine under peremptory norms of \ninternational law by formally recognising the inalienable right of \nthe Palestinian people as a whole to self-determination and bring \nan end to efforts aimed at denying that right;\u00a9 Activestills\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ1843. Take positive action to ensure the full realisation of the right of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination, including under Article 1 \nof the ICCPR and ICESCR, and cooperate toward the full realisation \nof complete freedom and independence of the Palestinian people, \nwho are subjected to ongoing settler colonialism, in accordance \nwith their freely expressed will and desire;\n4. Refrain from recognising any legitimacy of the unlawful situation \ncreated by Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime and ensure \nthey do not contribute, directly or indirectly, toward the \nmaintenance of Israeli apartheid, in line with extraterritorial \nobligations;\n5. Cooperate to bring the unlawful situation created by Israel\u2019s \nsettler colonial apartheid regime to an end, including by \ntaking effective measures toward the dismantlement of Zionist \nparastatal institutions, including the WZO/JA, and JNF, and by \nimplementing economic sanctions nationally and multilaterally \nand by severing diplomatic, cultural, and trade ties with Israel \nas required by international law and suspend existing trade and \ncooperation agreements with Israel, including at the national and \nregional levels;\n6. Pressure Israel to cease all measures and policies and practices \nthat contribute to the fragmentation of the Palestinian people, \nincluding the denial of the rights of return and self-determination, \nthe denial of family unification, the closure and blockade of the \nGaza Strip, the construction and maintenance of the Annexation \nWall and its associated regime, and other movement and access \nrestrictions, as core elements of Israel\u2019s apartheid regime;\n7. Demand Israel cease conferring public functions of the state to \nthe WZO/JA, JNF, and affiliated Zionist institutions, which are \nchartered to carry out material discrimination against non-Jewish \npersons and have historically prevented the Palestinian people \nfrom exercising control over their means of subsistence, including \ntheir natural resources, by exploiting and diverting these for the \nbenefit of Zionist settler colonisation;\n\n\nRecommendations\nAL-HAQ1858. Rescind \u2018charitable\u2019 and other tax-exempt or \u2018non-governmental\u2019 \nstatus of parastatal institutions and their affiliates operating \nwithin domestic jurisdiction, recognising instead their actual \nstatus as foreign agents;\n9. Demand Israel cease forthwith and lift with immediate effect the \nongoing closure and blockade of the Gaza Strip, including lifting \nrestrictions on dual use items and access to essential services, \nincluding healthcare, for Palestinians;\n10. Call on the Israeli regime to release all Palestinian political \nprisoners, to end its widespread and systematic use of arbitrary \ndetention and commission of torture and other ill-treatment in \nIsraeli prisons and detention centres, as well as to end the trial \nof Palestinian civilians, including children, in the Israeli military \ncourt system;\n11. Recognise that the Israeli civilian and military court systems are \ncomplicit in Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime and have \nnormalised and entrenched the pervasive impunity enjoyed by \nIsraeli military and state officials, including for systematic torture \nand other ill-treatment by state bodies in the unlawful extraction \nof information for use in judicial proceedings;\n12. Impose travel bans and asset freezes on Israeli political, military, \nand government officials as well as settlers associated with \nIsrael\u2019s apartheid regime, its illegal settler colonial enterprise, \nand related international crimes;\n13. Demand that Israel immediately cease any and all practices of \nintimidation, harassment, smear campaigns, and other forms of \nsilencing of human rights defenders and civil society organisations \nfor their opposition to apartheid, including by repealing with \nimmediate effect the unlawful October 2021 designations of the \nsix Palestinian human rights and civil society organisations both \nunder Israeli domestic law and under military orders;\n14. Ensure that in their own laws, policies, and practices, the rights \nto freedom of opinion, expression, freedom of assembly and \n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ186association, of Palestinians and anyone advocating for the rights \nof the Palestinian people are respected, protected, and fulfilled, \nincluding their right to engage in boycotts and, where relevant, to \nimmediately repeal all legislation and other measures that aim to \ncriminalise boycotts of Israel;\n15. Implement a mandatory and comprehensive arms embargo \nnationally or multilaterally against Israel that includes:\n (i) Prohibition of the provision to Israel of arms and related \nmat\u00e9riel of all types, including the sale or transfer of weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, security \nequipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts for the \naforementioned;\n (ii) Termination of all existing and forthcoming contractual \narrangements with and licenses granted to Israel relating \nto the manufacture and maintenance of arms, ammunition, \nmilitary equipment, vehicles, and security and surveillance \nequipment;\n (iii) Prohibition of any cooperation with Israel in the manufacture \nand development of nuclear weapons;\n16. Demand that Israel ensures the immediate and full realisation of \nthe inalienable rights of Palestinian refugees, displaced persons, \nand involuntary exiles, including to return to their homes, lands, \nand properties in their villages, towns, and cities of origin, as \nwell as to restitution of their property and compensation for the \ndamages inflicted upon them as a result of the ongoing Nakba, \nas integral to realising the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-\ndetermination;\n17. Demand that Israel repeal all domestic legislation and military \norders enshrining racial discrimination, domination, and \noppression over the Palestinian people as a whole, including the \nLaw of Return (1950), the Absentee Property Law (1950), the \nCitizenship Law (1952), the Status Law (1952), the Citizenship \nand Entry into Israel Law (1952), the Legal and Administrative \n\n\nRecommendations\nAL-HAQ187Matters Law (1970), the Jewish Nation-State Basic Law (2018), the \nCitizenship and Entry into Israel Law (Temporary Order) (2022), \nand all other laws and measures imposing material discrimination \nagainst the Palestinian people;\n18. Demand an immediate end to Israel\u2019s discriminatory planning \nand zoning policies as manifestations of the crimes of population \ntransfer and apartheid, including illegal house demolitions, the \ndestruction of Palestinian property, and denial of access to land \nand other natural resources;\n19. Warn against the direct and indirect legal risks and consequences of \ncarrying out and maintaining business activities and relationships \nwith Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime, including through \npublic advisories and notices disseminated among businesses, \nfinancial institutions, and other private actors;\n20. Declare   as criminal organisations, institutions, and individuals \ncommitting and/or complicit in the crimes of apartheid and \npopulation transfer against the Palestinian people;\n21. Activate universal jurisdiction mechanisms to try suspected \nperpetrators of grave breaches and other international crimes, \nincluding the crimes of population transfer and apartheid, against \nthe Palestinian people in their own domestic courts, including on \nthe basis of the Apartheid Convention;\n22. For states who have not already done so, ratify relevant \ninternational treaties, including the Apartheid Convention, Rome \nStatute, and international human rights law instruments; and\n23. Support the Prosecutor of the ICC in conducting a prompt, \nthorough, and comprehensive investigation into the Situation \nin Palestine and urge the investigation and prosecution of \nperpetrators of the crimes of apartheid and population transfer, \namong other international crimes.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ1889.2  To the High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions\n24. Consider individual, joint, and collective measures to implement \ncommon Article 1 of the Geneva Conventions, which requires \nthe High Contracting Parties \u2018to respect and ensure respect\u2019 for \nthe Conventions in all circumstances by undertaking practical \nmeasures of enforcement and effective measures available under \nthe Fourth Geneva Convention to bring an end to Israel\u2019s settler \ncolonial apartheid regime and other breaches of international \nhumanitarian law, including but not limited to:771\n (i) Engaging the enquiry procedure under Article 149 of the \nFourth Geneva Convention; \n (ii) Dispatching an International Humanitarian Fact-finding \nCommission to report back to the High Contracting Parties;\n (iii) Applying corresponding domestic adjudication obligations, \nin particular, through the application of universal jurisdiction \nmechanisms;\n (iv) Putting an end to the Israeli closure and blockade of the \nGaza Strip, recognising its illegality, not rendering aid or \nassistance in maintaining it;\n (v) Divesting from and imposing economic and military \nsanctions on Israel and other states abetting grave breaches \nof international humanitarian law;\n (vi) Downgrading diplomatic relations with Israel and other \nstates abetting grave breaches;\n (vii) Freezing the assets of legal and natural persons responsible \nfor gross violations and grave breaches;\n (viii) Recognising Israel\u2019s parastatal institutions (WZO/JA, \nJNF, United Israel Appeal, and affiliates) as organs of the \n771\u2003 These recommendations were put forward in 2010 by civil society from Palestine and other \ncountries in a letter to Switzerland for convening the High Contracting Parties.

Ensure that individuals, corporate actors, and other for-profit \nand non-profit organisations involved in and/or complicit in \nthe commission of the crime of apartheid, other crimes against \nhumanity and war crimes, and grave human rights violations are \nheld to account through all available mechanisms at national, \nregional, and international levels;\n26. Provide political and financial support for the annual update of \nthe UN Database on corporate entities involved in illegal Israeli \nsettlements and take effective steps to ensure that the list of \ncompanies continues to be updated, as mandated, and as a \ncomprehensive and living tool for corporate accountability, and \nto broaden the scope to include all business entities and for-profit \nand non-profit organisations that are complicit in apartheid;\n27. Legislate, in domestic legal systems, for mandatory human rights \ndue diligence procedures for all corporate entities and for-profit \nand non-profit organisations engaged in activities within and \noutside their jurisdictions, with special attention afforded to \nconflict-affected areas, occupied and annexed territory, where \nenhanced mandatory human rights due diligence is necessary. \nSuch legislation should align with the UN Guiding Principles on \nBusiness and Human Rights, the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines, and relevant \nprovisions of international human rights law and international \nhumanitarian law, as applicable;\n28. Adopt legislation, domestically and regionally, to prohibit the \nimport of goods and services from illegal settlements, including \nin Palestine, and ban trade with and economic support for the \nillegal settlement enterprise; as Israel\u2019s largest trade partner, the \nEU should lead by example in this regard;\n29. Apply public procurement law in line with relevant obligations \nand responsibilities for states under international law, the UN \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the OECD \n\n\nRecommendations\nAL-HAQ191Guidelines, which entails denying public contracts to companies \ninvolved in grave violations of international law; \n30. Investigate and prosecute private enterprises and individual \n\u2018charities\u2019 that materially or otherwise support the Israeli settler \ncolonial apartheid regime; and\n31. Incorporate legislation to give effect to the principle of universal \njurisdiction domestically for the prosecution of business entities, \nfinancial institutions, for-profit and non-profit organisations, \nand individuals for the crimes of apartheid and population \ntransfer, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, and other \ninternational crimes to ensure perpetrators are held to account.\n9.4   To Palestinian Officials\n32. Continue to recognise and condemn, including through regional \nand international organisations, that Israel\u2019s discriminatory laws, \npolicies, and practices have cumulatively established and continue \nto maintain an apartheid regime of systemic racial oppression and \ndomination over the Palestinian people as a whole, as part of the \nZionist settler colonial project, using strategic fragmentation as \nits primary tool, giving rise to individual criminal responsibility in \naddition to engaging Israel\u2019s state responsibility for internationally \nwrongful acts;\n33. Ensure that they do not render direct or indirect assistance \nto Israel\u2019s settler colonial apartheid regime, including by not \ncontributing to the Israeli policy of strategic fragmentation; and\n34. Ensure a comprehensive representation of the Palestinian people \nas a whole, including Palestinian refugees and exiles abroad and \nPalestinian citizens inside the Green Line, through functional \nand democratic institutions, in pursuing the realisation of the \ncollective right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\n\nISRAELI  APARTHEID\nTool of Zionist Settler Colonialism AL-HAQ1929.5   To Member States of the Human Rights Council\n35. Adopt a resolution recognising that Israel has established and \nmaintains an apartheid regime over the Palestinian people as a \nwhole and adopt effective measures to dismantle the regime;\n36. Continue to mainstream and mobilise support against Israel\u2019s \nsettler colonial apartheid regime by delivering statements \nrecognising and condemning this regime in national capacities as \nwell as through cross-regional statements;\n37.
