Its gunmen \u201cwere seen around the plantations.\u201d These gunmen are led by the big landlord company Agropecu\u00e1ria Mata Sul S.A. Their objective was to attack a prosperous and fundamental crop in the area: sugar cane. Other attacks they had carried out have been with poison, trying to expel peasants from their lands, but everything has been unsuccessful.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As we have reported, the peasants of Barro Branco, led by the League of Poor Peasants (LCP), are fiercely resisting the attacks of the latifundium, supported by students and democratic intellectuals, for example in the Glorious Battle of Barro Branco on September 28. The harassment by the gunmen as well as by the old Brazilian State continues, but that has not prevented them from continuing their struggle and mobilization.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-the-red-herald wp-block-embed-the-red-herald\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cf0uXIjZDZ\">\n    <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2024/10/24/on-the-struggle-for-land-in-barro-branco-brazil/\">\n     On the struggle for land in Barro Branco, Brazil\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"cf0uXIjZDZ\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://redherald.org/2024/10/24/on-the-struggle-for-land-in-barro-branco-brazil/embed/#?secret=K0TRLJlqft#?secret=cf0uXIjZDZ\" style=\"position: absolute; visibility: hidden;\" title=\"\u201cOn the struggle for land in Barro Branco, Brazil\u201d \u2014 The Red Herald\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  This is the price to be paid by those who not only combat and resist, but also defeat the latifundium, make it retreat and its goons flee.
