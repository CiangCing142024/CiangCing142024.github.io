Access movementFeminininopopular.com.br <br/><br/>  March 2, 2024 MFP Without defeating imperialism there will be no emancipation of women at a key moment in the Sacred War of Resis - Palestinian national, the United States (USA) wide its role as the largest enemy of the people's peoples. Rare are an Yankee politicians was so open, blatantly and unconditionally is nies as Joe Biden, which plays the misleading speech he intends to present as essentially distinct “demo - cracates” and “republicans”. Both rival, yes, in prey and genocide, confirming Lenin's powerful analysis that imperialism is not a policy, which can be al - the alternation of a government, but it is the upper and ultimate stage of capianism , time of reaction and violence throughout the line and anteasala of the world proletarian revolution. The Palestinian people have lived in an open prison for over 70 years, under considering economic blockade, military surveillance, routine of Zionist aggressions - both by mili forces and by the settlers - and mass expulsion. of millions of people, a situation that has come to paroxysm since the reaction to the heroic operation of the di - Lúvio al -aqsa on 7 or - tubro 2023. The reaction of Netanyahu and the sion beasts that follow him is mere demonstration of cowardice and despair before the irresistible lift of the Palestinian but - sas. Since or - Tubro Israel has murdered more than 28,000 Palestinians. And who are these people? About 70% of them are mos and children. Unconditional US support for Israel -made genocide attests to the role of imperialism as the greatest enemy of the people of the world, in its greed to dominate having - rich and imposing puppet governments and expanding its - mynic, conjuring the growing danger of its decline and ensure as super - CA - CA. Isn't that way that it has acted in the Middle East expanded for so long? For example the invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan, perm as many threats to Iran, Democratic Republic for Korea and Venezue, the funding and support for state blows in the Ukra - NIA and other former reports of the former USSR etc. The attackers do not recall such barbaries because they are strong, as they want to make the reformists believe, but because they feel the poly from their hands before the heroic and indomitable resistance and the rebellion of the oppressed. IMPERIALIS - MO imposes unfair wars as part of the world's sharing and sharing to overcome their crises. The concentration of income and in - poor masses in the world imposes unsurpassed political challenges for imperialism. Yes, data from 2023 point out that the 5 largest companies in the world have together the value of GDP of the economies of Africa, Latin America and Cari - BE. The founder of Empresa of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, one of the richest in the world, has increased by more than $ 30 million since 2020 his already bilius fortune, at the expense of showing the blood of the proleta - the third world and even the deterioration of social rights in imperialist countries. This is the path of all monopolistic companies, incompatible even with demo -creatures enshrined by the bourgeois revolution, an inevitable reason for the rise of contemporary fascism. In response to this place, in the last year, protes are raised in various parts of the world against the exploitation of the great monopolies. In England, if Daniel Alves: What is the rape price? Daniel Alves, now former Ja - Football Gador, was with four years and six months by Spanish justice - there for raping a Jo - comes in a nightclub in Barce - Canvas. The prison time (well lower, for example, as provided for in Brazilian law) was mitigated by the payment of a fine of the condemnation of 900 thousand reais, paid, as stated by its “parso” Neymar. In addition to the decrease in the sentence, Daniel Alves tries to obtain the prior departure from the prison, until the end of April, upon payment of a kind of “security”. In other words, it is a kind of bizarre “insurance rape”. Yes, how much is a rape worth? This, on the one hand, wide the hypocritical character From bourgeois ideology, which does not see human relations more than mere goods to be negotiated like any other (what the so -called “social networks” live except mercantilization, precisely, what is more human in us?), And in the case of women, as consumer objects - which can, like any objects, be priced. It can then be said that the editorial a general strike of half a million workers took the country, which undergoes a severe economic crisis by submitting the people to a fall in their condition of life. In China, a wave of mass layoffs in monopolistic companies raised the explosiveness of the protests, as happened at Jianqiao Industrial Park, in the city of Chongqinq, and in the Rebellion of Zhengzhou Province. In addition, the Chine - SA Real Estate Crisis haunts the world economy. Latin America, deded by imperialism as its backyard, also burns in rebellions such as Argentina where the reactionary government cuddled imposed an anti -povo decrease against workers and other popular masses, which respond to the height in multipurpose protes. Nor the restriction of freedoms of manifestation, expression and organization prevented revolts. Being half of the class women also argue on themselves the weight exploration. To follow with his ideals of super - power, the dying immersion maintains and immersion to secular female oppression. The campaigns taken by the press monopoly, bigwigs and famous ones about “women's rights”, “not no”, etc, are not enough for reversing the centuries of oppression. They are, in fact, pure demagogy. Only one hand of colorful paint over its true misogynist face. Without forgetting the non -negotiable need for the struggle to keep the right already conquered, it is light to believe that female emancipation can be completed in the milestones of this society. The people of the people, besides having less salary (earns 21% less than the HO - mens), the most precarious jobs (80% of informal carbackers) and are difficult to keep employing, is obliged , also, to exercise a double workday: the work of the unpaid. This unpaid domestic work, invisible and in - bruteist by the working woman, to be that the employer keeps the wages extremely low. While the women of the ruling classes buy the kitchen, clean and care of children, the women of the people are the ones who need to do these tasks, besides working outside to complement the house's income or even ensure it alone . In popular homes women are the first to get up and the last to lie down. In Brazil, this under -unavoid work is on average 21.3 hours a week. In turn, bai wages maintain the worker and his family in a precarious life condition, and are part of the gear of cyclical crises: reducing consumption and generating overproduction crises. And it is in these moments of crisis that increase all kinds of violence and Barbá - ries: extraction of wealth and greater reactionary in the countries of lacketh governments of imperialism and trauma, physical and psychological, the victim is worth 900 thousand reais? In which, essentially, this is different, say, from Afghan tribal justice, condemned as Barbara by the "West", as it is common for the "indemnity" of husbands to the families of their wives murdered with goats and pieces of land? In addition, it also falls apart, with this compensation in exchange for the sentence, any vague idea of an egalitarian “justice” for all: for the same barbaric crime of ES - Tupro (in the case of Daniel Al - Ves, the process brought to light Uncontroversial evidence), a millionaire will not respond like a poor. It is worth here in other parts of capitalist society: for the bourgeoisie, always, crime pays off. <br/><br/> March 3, 2024 MFP March 2024 Economic Crisis Weighs even more about women in defeat of imperialism there will be no emancipation of womenSob Luiz Inacio, the situation of working women has not changed at all despite all the promises during the last electoral period - in which the situation of the mes was exactly one of the most debated points - the lives of women of the people, especially the poorest layers, such as slum residents in cities and peasants landless or with Little land in the whole, it has not changed, neither shape nor background. During this time, Luiz Inácio and Alckmin's opportunistic government has practiced its agenda of “governance” (read: alliance with the same re -nationary coalition that is governing whatever the government, from Sarney to Bolson - RO) and appeasement with the scammers and the far right, at the expense of popular interests. Even shy measures, considered in the elections, as to the taxation of the great fortunes and the recognition of work rights for application workers, were not implemented. For the poor, by contrast, the only policy has been the increase of violence in the countryside and in the city. Another stark fact of the crop - if it is the increase in political violence, as evidenced in the recent murders of the quilombola leadership Mother Bernade - Te and Pajé Nega Pataxó, both in the state of Bahia, whose government of petista Jerônimo Rodrigues has nothing has nothing Made to reduce the extreme right estate contracts against the public lands and territory - indigenous rivers. Even more encouraged by the recent approval of the criminal temporal landmark, associations of landlords, screams and land thieves such as the “Invasion Ze - RO” group, has armed and trained real gunmen's armies to promote ile - gais repossession - , murder leadership and try to contain the struggle and land. Most of these gentlemen make up the social base of pockets and the far right, openly the return of its leader to the government and the outcome of the fascist military coup. Meanwhile, Luiz Inácio and his minister deliver the budget to their “allies” Artur Lira and other Bandados de Colori - Congress's white, as if similar to the PU - this contains the Sanha Gol - track that emanates above all Armed forces and landowners. The recurring episodes of police slaves - with the derivatives of the “Summer Operation” in Santos, which has already resulted in 54 deaths, in addition to the permanent site of the carioca favelas - dis- nudar the true reactionary civil war - Dominant of great bourgeois and landowners servants of imperialism, especially Yankee, against the people. As you have seen, to arm the police and equip the representation - are at all levels there is no spending contingency or fiscal ceiling. For health and education, funds color, the depths of professionals and structural degradation are a routine, as revealed in the inability of the state to prevent and offer care to carrier during the current dengue epidemic . In a word, to the richness, everything, for the people, nothing! The promises of public policies for the mes, which were trumped during the electoral farce, have already been forgotten. What was done was pure makeup, as is the case with the distribution of menstrual absorbers in the “Popular Pharmacy Program”, for which an endless bureaucracy is required to prove poverty, an exposure and humiliation that inhibits the search for many women. Issues such as the valorization of salary - myself and the law of salary equalization between men and women of the same profession became dead letter. Most women are without formal employment, and “see each other” as they can to support their children. Among the workers, black women lead the worst rates of always - remuneration and occupation in unprotected employment, without a formal contract and without rights. The economic crisis, unemployment and inflation weigh even more about women. According to the National Pesqui - Sample of continuous household samples, determined by IBGE, in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased inequality between men and women in the labor market. 20%, in the quarterly, increased to 25% the difference in income between men and women. They earn an average of 25% less. Work women, especially black workers, are the most penalized for hunger and unemployment - female unemployment is 55% higher than male, and 47% of women live in food safety situations. This economic release exposes us to other violence. Thus, only in the first four months of 2023 17,500 sexual violations against children or adolescents were recorded, and this cruel reality access to abortion in the current law (rape, which puts the life of the life of the law. mother and fetal anencephaly) has been increasingly difficult in public health services, forcing women to risk life to perform abortion. Dust the revolution of new democracy and popular protest! The severe economic, political and military crisis which the country has arrived is not a conjunctural fact or passing through: its roots are in the five centuries of latifunction and domination, first colonial, imperialist of - there. An economy under - litifundal and imperialism, always found and without margin for national development. Classes Doma - Nantes Lacaines of imperialism, smaller partners who are content with crumbs. Permanent Political Crisis, Frequently Volucional Situations and Recurring Military Interventions. In addition to the unbearable yoke that weighs on us people, women also wrap a fourth mountain of exploration: female oppression. ES - is expressed in the unpaid domestic work; in the inferior and prejudiced form as women are seen by macho ideology; In lower salaries and the most demeaning working conditions that focus on us, as well as several other consequences, such as self -timing, which loves us to unfortunate situations and gets sick. In this March 8th, we, from the Popular Women's Movement, make a key to women working in the countryside and the city to boost the agrarian reion and popular protest, thickening the ranks of the revolution of Nova Democracy in our country. We must, part by part and in every corner of this country, to pull what is ours by right - earth, bread, employment, until we have the government of everything, that is, power. May this memorable date, which is inscribed in the list of the dates of the internal - national proletariat, mark once again with class seal the need to connect all these fighting struggles for a fight for a Brazil and a new world, in which Sovereign Trele Red flag. National situation wars of prey around the world. There are, under imperialis - perspectives of advance for workers except those propelled by the proper chain of popular and revolutionary struggle. Women, facing protests in both the neighborhoods of imperialist countries and in the villages and slums of the oppressed countries, of brands given with men in their class only reaches - their complete emanciament with the drinking of this rotting exploration system. Editorial continuation <br/><br/> March 4, 2024 MFP Origin and meaning of March 8, March 8 - International Proletarian Women's Day has a special immersion in the revolutionary struggle of all peoples. The tribute to the struggle of women from the exploited and oppressed classes of all countries was proposed by Clara Zetkin - German Social Democratic Party leader - at the II Conference of Socialist Mudes in 1910, held in Denmark. Approved by the delegates, the tribute was held on different days in the first years. On March 8, 1917, at the height of a revolutionary situation, there was a march with tens of thousands of workers against hunger, war and tsarism, under the direction of the Bolsheviks in Petro - from the then capital of Russia, giving Beginning a political general strike against the Czarist Gime. These reconciliations marked the most important revolutionary PE - The Great Revolution of October in 1917 - when the Russian working class and the historical ally class, take power and begin the construction of the first homeland. So - Cialist of History, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - USSR. It is in Hornage to this rebellion of the Russian workers that the celebration of the inter - national day of prole women will be held on March 8, by the revolutionary movements - rivers of women around the world, as a mark of content of the date of the date. In the 1950s, the ruling classes reacted - they tried to suppress these historical references linked to the international communist movement, trying to transform the one into the international day of all women, exploited and exploited, oppressed and oppressed. They learned the Lie Version - that the strike of the weavers in New York, when 129 workers and 17 workers died, in a large fire locked by the bosses inside the building in flames, had occurred on March 8 and then that date passed to be celebrated internationally. Since they could not suppress the class character of a date already consolidated around the world, they then sought a struggle that happened outside the socialist territory. The defense of the bourgeoisie books, repeated in choir by opportunism and revisionism, referring to New York workers is therefore a scam. Not that the fact has not occurred, nor that the struggle of US workers is not important and is not part of the international labor movement. By the way, they are heroines of the struggle of the proletariat and the emancipation of the mu - lher. But his heroism did not occur on March 8, but on March 25, 1911. International Proletarian Women's Day was not instituted with refinement in this event, but in the great socialist revolution of October in 1917. What imperialism actually tends is to deny that March 8 is linked to the worldwide pro - and therefore belongs to exploited and oppressed masses from all over the world that combat imperialism. And this does not allow in its vain attempt to deny the revolution and to erase history the historical achievements of the working class and the peasantry directed by the Great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, under the great leadership of Lenin and Stalin . “The origin of the family, private property and state” published in 1884 by Friedrich Engels, the most important Marxist work for the historical explanation of female oppression. It demonstrates how men and women relations have changed according to the development of the human character of having to have in nature and how it reflected in the various forms of family organization to monogamy and the passage of barbarism to civilization. In the thesis of MFP “The Eman - Women's Cipa is the work of the proletarian revolution” we present a brief summary that says: "In the early form - human social formation (the genes), predominated for centuries Matriarchy, where women had pre -pondering for centuries and great political and social immersion. Matriarchy was the form of organization of the first human families prior to the emergence of private property. The emergence of private ownership, derived from the formation of surplus of production, profoundly modifies those existing social relationships. Men begin to transform the expired in the struggles between the groups for survival, in slaves, to meet the greatest labor needs. At that moment to man, to whom in the divine Until then, work was mainly fitted to the case, therefore belonged to the tools and utensils needed for their function; and in turn belonged to women the utensils linked to their function of caring mainly in agriculture and the treatment of domestic things . Thus, the new division of work will generate the preponde of male. With the production of surpluses, the problem of the inheritance that previously passed through the maternal lineage, and there was no surplus of production, was composed of few utensils. With the production of surpluses, under the property of the Ho - these will also seek recognition of inheritance for their children and society starts to organize according to the paternal line. Thus' the collapse of the maternal right was the great historical defeat of females throughout the world. The man also seized the direction of the house; converted into a servant, a slave to man's lust, a simple insight of reproduction. ' (Engels) Development of patriarchy reaches our days and to make it worth it was necessary to alter ancestral traditions, replacing them with others applied from the view of the class divided into classes. As a way, women will suffer two types of oppression: their oppression as class and the other as a gender. And the di - ferent modes of production took advantage of this situation in their favor, and in capitalism, the non -domestic work made by women have the important role of reducing the value of the workforce and increasing the lu - cro capitalist. ”Engels' concern about female oppression surpassed the theoretical aspect and being deeply linked to the labor movement, accompanied, in Germany, the struggle of prominent communist leaders such as Clara Zetkin who crashed herculean efforts to organize the union struggle of women and their incorporation into the German social democratic party. Fight that rose to the congresses of the II Tenational, resulting in a large female corporation to communist parties.

<strong>
   Mumbai, March 5, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court on Tuesday acquitted political prisoner Dr. G.N. Saibaba, (a former professor of English at Delhi University’s Ram lal Anand College), and his five co-defendants in a Maoist links case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), saying the prosecution could not prove the case against them beyond reasonable doubt.
 </p>
<p>
  In its 293-page verdict, the bench held that the prosecution failed to prove electronic evidence and it was difficult to accept that the accused had conspired and made preparation to commit a terrorist act which was not spelt out in the case. Observing that procedural mandate was not followed in maintaining the case diary despite charges of serious offenses leveled against the accused, it said the evidence could not be “free from doubt’”.
 </p>
<p>
  It also observed that mere possession of literature sympathetic to Maoist philosophy could not be an offense under the UAPA and merely downloading Maoist material wouldn’t constitute an offense unless specific evidence was provided.
 </p>
<p>
  Within hours, the Maharashtra government approached the Supreme Court seeking an urgent hearing, after it failed to convince the High Court to stay the implementation of the judgment.
 </p>
<p>
  A Division Bench of Justice Vinay Joshi and Justice Valmiki S.A. Menezes also set aside the life sentence awarded to Dr. Saibaba and the other accused — Mahesh Tirki, Hem Mishra, Pandu Narote (who died in 2022), Vijay Tirki and Prashant Rahi — by a sessions court in 2017, and held the sanction for prosecution under UAPA as “null and void”.
 </p>
<p>
  A Bombay High Court led by Justice Rohit B. Deo too had acquitted Dr. Saibaba and the other five accused on October 14, 2022, only for the Supreme Court to stay the verdict and ask for the case to be heard afresh.
 </p>
<p>
  Soon after the judgement was pronounced on Tuesday, Advocate-General Birendra Saraf, on behalf of the State, requested the High Court to stay the operation of its judgment for six weeks to allow the government to approach the Supreme Court. However, the Bench refused to grant a stay. “We have already acquitted the accused and directed their release forthwith if not required in any other case. We cannot stall the said order, which may affect the right to personal liberty,” the court said.
 </p>
<p>
  Noting that the prosecution had failed to “establish any legal seizure or any incriminating material against the accused”, the court said, “The trial court judgment is not sustainable in the hands of law. We, therefore, allow the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment. All the accused stand acquitted.”
 </p>
<p>
  The Maharashtra government subsequently filed an appeal in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
 </p>
<p>
  Dr. Saibaba, who is wheelchair-bound, was arrested on May 19, 2014 while he was on his way home from Delhi University, by a joint team of the Maharashtra police, Andhra Pradesh police, and the Intelligence Bureau, in a case pertaining to alleged ties with the CPI (Maoist) and its frontal group the Revolutionary Democratic Front. He has been lodged in the Nagpur Central Jail since his arrest in the case in 2014.
 </p>
<p>
  In March 2017, a sessions court in Gadchiroli district, Maharashtra state, convicted Dr. Saibaba and five other accused for indulging in activities amounting to waging war against the country. They were also held guilty of possessing Maoist literature that they planned to circulate among underground Maoists and the residents of Gadchiroli district to provoke the people to resort to violence.
 </p>
<p>
  Based on the charges of Section 45(1) of the UAPA by the sessions court, Dr. Saibaba had filed an appeal in the Bombay High Court, where a Bench led by Justice Deo too had acquitted him and the other five, citing procedural lapses. “While terrorism poses an ominous threat to national security and every legitimate weapon in the armory must be deployed against it, a civil democracy cannot sacrifice procedural safeguards afforded to the accused,” the Bench had noted.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the very next day, a special Bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justice M.R. Shah (now retired) and Justice Bela M. Trivedi suspended their acquittals, stating that the High Court did not consider “the merits of the case including the gravity of the offense”. In April 2023, it set aside the HC’s acquittal order and directed it to hear the appeal filed by Dr. Saibaba afresh.
 </p>
<p>
  Welcoming Tuesday’s verdict, Dr. Saibaba’s wife Vasantha Kumari said that her husband’s reputation was never at stake as people who knew him had always believed in him. “It feels like a huge relief but we don’t know what to expect right now. He was acquitted in 2022 as well, but the decision was challenged. Till the time he comes back home here, we will remain anxious,” she said in Delhi.

     Tobias

     Great Britain, according to The Guardian, confirmed the presence of a

   Not anyone manages to successfully direct the masses to the point of the revolution, not anyone manages to stand out as a leader of the party during the recomposition of a country after a civil war, not anyone manages to lead a process of
   <strong>
    agricultural, technological and scientific industrialization and modernization in a country with more than 150 million inhabitants
   </strong>
   , not anyone effectively command the army that defeated fascism, not anyone manages to direct a project that
   <strong>
    made a semi -feudal country a world power in 30 years
   </strong>
   Not anyone has managed to constitute one of the most important and prominent leaders of the world working class throughout its history and be a reference even more than 70 years after their death; But Stalin achieved all this for the proletariat and much more.
  </p>
<p>
   He is probably the communist leader whom the world bourgeoisie has spent on defamations and dissemination of widely known historical lies, even today, 71 years after his death; But that has not been an obstacle to studying its invaluable contributions to communist ideology as well as the progress of Eastern Europe International proletariat is missing.
  </p>
<p>
   Since its debate between anarchists and communists, its correct interpretation of the national issue from the point of view of Marxism, through the collection and claim of Lenin's ideas for the progress of the revolution, reaching the valuable
   <strong>
    Internationalist characterization of the Socialist Revolution
   </strong>
   and the valuable explanation and theoretical dissemination of
   <strong>
    Dialectical materialism and historical materialism
   </strong>
   ; as well as the very important influence on the life and work of Mao Tse-Tung and the Asian communists, key to the development of the ideology of the proletariat: the
   <strong>
    Marxism-Leninism-Maoism
   </strong>
   . Its ideological and practical legacy is impressive, worthy of admiration and above all of a rigorous study that allows us, with the same scientific method of materialism,
   <strong>
    Extract and update all their contributions that are still served to the workers' struggle
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   Stalin at the time was the
   <strong>
    enemy most feared by the international bourgeoisie, imperialist powers of the West and the fascist axis
   </strong>
   , because they knew that a man like Stalin meant an imminent danger to his domain of exploitation and misery; And even today, seeing that the workers, especially the youngest, continue to value and claim the figure so satanized and dirty of Stalin, are filled with despair to see that our class and their youth do not continue to swallow their misinformative garbage; And it is our duty as a struggle workers to claim the figure of Stalin and everything that meant for the cause of the world's oppressed, cause for which we are still raising today
   <strong>
    The Red Flag that the Red Army of workers and peasants led by Stalin raised in the center of Berlin defeating fascism
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   As all men also wrong and made mistakes, but their contributions and legacy weigh much more and constitute a powerful tool for the fight we continue to fight, with Stalin as a reference, despite the bourgeois alienation, because as he himself said:
   <strong>
    «On my grave they will throw mountains of garbage; The wind of history will erase them inexorably »
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   Long live the working class!

   ¡Viva Stalin!

<p>
  For two months, the student's struggle against private universities has caused serious pressure on the government and the policy it serves. Students, from the very first week, through their general assemblies with decisions on occupations and demonstrations, have clearly shown how big their moods are to fight against the Pierrakakis bill. During the general assemblies and the political fermentation that exists in them, different views were heard from the forces on how this struggle should be given, different directions and lines came into the student movement.
 </p>
<p>
  But the more we move on to the day of the vote, the clearer the impasses that the reformist left wants to lead the student movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Two weeks ago and while we were still not well aware of what the date of voting was, we saw banners on the marches and placements of these forces in the general assemblies, with the slogan the law staying on the papers. This is not the first time this has happened. This is not the first time that the forces of the KNE and the ESAK with the logic of the defeat they have, to retreat from the struggle to overthrow the law. The same thing happened in the struggles against the Gavroglou law and then the Kerameos-Chrysochoid law and not only. In this direction, they clearly seem to be their unsolved masses that can struggle and overturn voted laws. It seems that they do not want to take on the political responsibilities and duties that are in the direction of overthrow and are comfortable behind a compassionate view of staying on the papers, which does not confront the system and the government, until we would say at all, we would say at all. since laws are passed to apply.
 </p>
<p>
  They also avoid attributing responsibilities to the real culprits of this attack, which is no other than the system and the government that represents it every time, but personify it in rectors, ministers, etc., as if they are in the initiative, as if they are not expressers. of the policy of the system that attacks the rights of the people. They put a demand for a particular rector or minister as a demand, cultivating illusions that with another Rector, for example, which will express the system more democratically, things will be better for students. Thus, ignoring the true role of the Great -Causing establishment within the schools, the Rectors, the presidents, etc. who actually act as the straps of the transfer and the implementation of the attack on the student youth and its right to public and free education. We also see, mainly on the part of the KNE, now that students have shown in every way that they want to fight, to try to undermine this race by replacing the occupations, with multifaceted actions. At a time when now there is more than ever there is a need to escalate the struggle to make the youth to win, they choose not only not to talk about masses, but about replacing them with other less dangerous forms of answer.
 </p>
<p>
  Indicative was their placement and attitude for the reminders. These forces did not request the abstinence from the remote control and were confined to a general complaint, which could not provide answers to the student world.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of all these rationales of defeat and subordination, against all these views that can disorient and reassure the world that we have already won, because the bill has been presented and voted on for a few weeks, we say that now there is a need. Continuing the race. A real victory for the student movement is for this bill not to be voted on and if it happens. Neither on paper, nor anywhere! For this to happen, there must be no withdrawal in our struggles. It takes even greater escalation, massives of our collective struggles, general assemblies, occupations, demonstrations and not normalization, political upgrading of the movement and linking students' struggle with workers, with farmers, with all society, to victory.

<p>
  For 8 weeks, students and all the people are mobilizing against private universities. We make mass demonstrations and occupations. The Panteion for 8 weeks is finished under occupation. The government uses both the immediate repression, the cops and the invasions of the police asylum and their long hand in the schools, rectors and great -speakers to suppress our struggles and move our collective processes.
 </p>
<p>
  Panteion's Rector, once again showing its true face and which interests it serves (those of the exploitation system) made a decision to carry out the spring semester. He decided to perform the spring semester until 28/6 and the spring exam until 26/7. The extension of the semester and the exam until the end of July comes to intensify our studies, influence students who work for the season and lead them to lose their exams and pass the systemic view that students should continue to deal with continuity And all year with our studies and nothing else. It fully utilizes the Diamantopoulou Law that sets the six months to last 13 weeks. This decision is a clear attempt to terrorize our struggle. It threatens to either stop or do lessons and exams by August. It is vindictively imposed on all of us who are mobilized against private universities.
 </p>
<p>
  Already in a series of schools in Athens and nationwide, telephones have begun as a continuation of the releases that have been recruited to (tele) suppress our struggle against private universities. The government is using the telecommunications and the extension of the semester to remove our collective processes. To return to their regularity, the regularity of the Rights of Rights and the Individual Road. This effort should not pass. Students must bypass the blackmail of the Rector and continue massively to the overthrow of the Pierrakakis law, even if the N/S is voted on. To continue against the submission and compromise of ... diverse actions and continue with assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. To fight against both private universities and previous anti -populist laws, Law 4777, the law -framework and all the previous ones such as Diamantopoulou.
 </p>
<p>
  To demand, against both the Rector and the Systemic Forces and the Left forces talking about replacements, not to extend the semester and examination, to block the telecommunications and not to participate in them.

Description: "Democracy" is engaged in the bayonets of generals little affecting democratic freedoms, not rare, regarded as a hindrance to their work as a counterrevolutionary bolt. In this sense, whether Luiz Inácio or the “Democrats” of the traditional right, all are unable to ensure their own democratic rights.

<div class="article-content">
<p>
  The eight-hour testimony of General Freire Gomes, former army commander in those tumultuous October-November 2022, was sufficient to ecstase liberal columnists. By saying a dozen half-enhancement along with lame excuses, General Freire Gomes gained all the confidence of the “Democrats” of the press monopoly.
 </p>
<p>
  Let us not forget that it was Freire Gomes who signed a note by the Army in November 22, amid the far-right armed actions by pressing on a military coup, which states that the coup camps in army facilities were “democratic manifestations” (note Also signed by the brigadeiro and then the Navy Commander, Almir Garnier, the same one that was placed on the orders of the coup president). It was also our “Democrat” here who ordered General Estevam Theophilo, commander of land operations of the Army, would meet Bolsonaro in December - in whose meeting both agreed that, if the state of siege was decreed, the troops of Theophilo would fulfill The coup order. By the way, what was the response of the former army commander on these questions?
 </p>
<p>
  Freire Gomes shares the same opinion as the current army commander, Tomás Ribeiro Paiva (the same one who took an active part of the threat of Villas-Bôas to the STF in 2018). They are not supporters of this “radicalism” to culminate the closure of the regime now. Nor are they advocates by the beginning of this old democracy: they believe it can be sublevated, if this is the best path of preventive action to defend the interests of the ruling classes and imperialism mainly Yankee (skillfully named “national integrity”, it is not, gentlemen ?). However, this band within the Armed Forces, who today call the legalist, believes that before, “democracy” is useful for their counterrevolutionary purposes, provided that, in times of persistent crises, it is timely conducted with discreet interventions of the forces Armed in national political life and on other institutions. They know that in a country like Brazil, sequelaered by so many military blows, in which the “Democratic Liberals” are cowardly and in a context where there is a large portion of the desperate masses with the political regime and their rules, some blackmail and threats are enough. To achieve changes that dispense with tanks and troops - which, for all purposes, is a crime against such "democracy." This is its paradoxical “legalism”: a legalism that has as its starting point that the Armed Forces are moderating constitutional stability, is an illegality. They are also "interventionists," but today they prefer to be better with the best modes compared to the pockets.
 </p>
<p>
  Does anyone doubt this is also the thinking of the current army commander? For let us remember that he commanded the Academy of Negras when Bolsonaro launched his candidacy for the presidency during the graduation of a cadet class. It was Tomás Paiva who personally advised Villas-Bôas in the writing of the tweet, threatening the STF, in 2018, to remove Luiz Inacio from the electoral play. As a commander of the Army in February 2023, he allowed the former commander, Julio César Arruda, fired by insubordination, to meet with the high command of the army. All this information was cleared by journalist Pedro Marín.
 </p>
<p>
  But not only from tutors lives the nation. She also has the liberals "Democrats", who cowered. Last week amid investigations that prove to be coup
  <strong>
   subject of the day
  </strong>
  , the President of the Republic said that it is necessary to forget the coup of 1964, as it is passed. So that there is no doubt about how unhappy this place was, Hamilton Mourão himself hastened to endorse it: “He is right, 64 belongs to the story. The subject died ”(being consistent with his opinion, the same anti -communist general is also protocoling, in the Senate, bill to amnesty the" green chickens "of 8 January! After all, if it is to" forget the past ", we start with January 8, isn't it?).
 </p>
<p>
  Such Luiz Inacio's stance is the typical example of cowardice: how can the subject of the military coup, man pale, if he is under discussion right now? Luiz Inácio pretends to forget that it was precisely the non -punishment of the gorillas of 64 that produced the current military crisis. After all, the same generals who commanded the country in the regime followed in their positions, reproducing the same doctrine and coup ideology in courses, curricula, troops and celebrations, year after year, of the “1964 Democratic Revolution” in the barracks. High officers, to this day, whether pockets or “legalists”, virtually everyone refuses to recognize and condemn the coup as such, and do tenders that only justify the same venture at some point. Here, too, Luiz Inácio's appeasement only feeds the coup.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, popular masses cannot trust that democratic rights and freedoms will be guaranteed in this old democracy. It is headed by loose, who are unable to confront the same roots of coup, insofar as they share the same class interests, landlord and great bourgeoisie, lacquals of imperialism, especially Yankee. In addition, “democracy” is engaged in the bayonets of generals that are not affected by the, often, as a hindrance to their counterrevolutionary bolt work. In this sense, whether Luiz Inácio or the “Democrats” of the traditional right, all are unable to ensure their own democratic rights. Popular masses, and only they, can with their independent mobilization, around their immediate interests, make the balance to hang in favor of democratic freedoms.

  Day25 invites Israeli boycott as part of the BDS campaign (boycott movement, disinvestment and sanctions on the Israeli state). That is, it calls on capital and states not to invest in Israel and not to import products from there. It does not simply conceal the criminals, as it makes no reference to the US and writes that "Western governments are simply watching unbearable" but promotes them as a solution. It avoids denouncing the Greek government and crushes nonsense for its possible prosecution by the International Criminal Court. It is therefore logical to address and baptize SYRIZA, PASOK and the New Left to plan the next government response. Those who applied the "made in usa" axes with the Israeli murderer. It will hardly make him a joke. It is most likely to see the saboteurs pop out of some colleges outside the House. Many are hung up with elders when they do not see the solution to the people.
 </p>
<p>
  The Zionist fascists of Israel are stuck with their spheres the hungry Palestinians waiting for a queue for a drowning of the so -called "humanitarian aid", that is, the global hypocrisy of "philanthropists". The Palestinian genocide is a fact. We have been watching her since last October take more and more wild features.
 </p>
<p>
  The parties, organizations and colleges, which refer to the left and the movement, instead of calling the people to rise to stop the extinction of another people, play the hide. Some are waiting for the KKE a demonstration on the sidelines of its work on the European elections, while they are waiting for them and others think they will fit everything on March 8, the Women's Day, chosen by the government to vote on the private bill. universities.
 </p>
<p>
  The situations that are shaped internationally are dangerous to all peoples of the world. The Palestinian genocide shows what awaits them. The survival of the Palestinians is the first task of the peoples towards themselves.
 </p>
<p>
  The anti -war anti -imperialist struggle is as necessary as ever.

  This next 03/08, at 12 noon, in the main auditorium of IFPE, in Recife, the Ventania movement will make a cine-debate of the film Red Detachment of women to celebrate the International Day of Proletarian Women.

In this film was also adapted in ballet and, soon after, opera, both produced by Chiang Ching, actress, Revolutionary Chinese and one of the main leaders of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

  The peasants denounced that the areas where they live are claimed by the landowners Sidney Sanches Zamora and Sidney Sanches Zamora Filho, who baptized the land as Palotina Farm. The peasants still claim that they are public lands of the Union.
 </p>
<p>
  Since December 2023, the armed attacks against the peasants have intensified, who have already reiterated that the

    (from March 6 to April 6, 2024)

    Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! How many times have we chanted this slogan for so many years? How many times have we proclaimed it in the mass demonstrations of recent weeks and last months? There is no doubt that none could be held without being launched or taken over this historic watchword of clear and clear support for historical Palestine. Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Against all odds !
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Palestine lives, it will live and it will defeat by this national liberation struggle which it leads, not since 1948 but since the presence of the first settlers on its land in the 1880s. It lives by its tireless fight, since the first day and by all possible forms of struggle (revolts, general strikes, actions of sabotage and military, guerrilla war) against the ardent of Zionist colonialism which aims not only to occupy its land but also to hunt its people, or even exterminate. She lives and reminds us that the Palestinians are not victims but fighters engaged against oppression, engaged in the only possible path for their salvation: that of resistance, the law of their existence. She lives against and against everything by relentlessly facing the imperialists in the region, whose Zionist colonialism is only the bridgehead and the organic arm for economic, geostrategic and military control of the wealth of the Arab world. She lives against and against everything despite the repeated attempts to fragment the Palestinian identity, between the Palestinians of 1948, Gaza, West Bank ... Palestine lives, despite the betrayals of the Arab reactionary states which, normalization after normalization, tried in vain By their collaboration with the Zionist enemy of legitimizing the occupier and emptying the Palestinian liberation struggle of its panarabist and internationalist dimension. Palestine lives, will live and defeat despite the plans of standardization and sharing brandished each time that the resistance intensifies, despite all the attempts to liquidate its revolution and its land in the form of so-called "peace Just and durable ", from a solution to two states or" a state of all its citizens ", plans that the Palestinian resistance has known and will always thwart.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Until the very ranks of solidarity movements in Palestine, we hear: "Palestine lives, but at what price!" This price is the one that peoples have always paid to free themselves from colonialism and oppression; It is the one that the Palestinian people have paid and still pay today to overcome in their national liberation struggle. Indescriptible sufferings and endured sacrifices, thousands of martyrs in recent months but also in all of Palestinian national history are all evidence of the criminal nature of Zionism and imperialism. Faced with this barbarism, our task is not to propagate the illusion of a negotiated outcome - a "just and lasting peace" which would perpetuate colonial domination -, it is not to appeal to
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    the "international community" or to institutions controlled by imperialism. In Palestine, takes place not a "conflict" from which it would be possible to come out by a fantasized outcome, but a colonial war which aims to eliminate a movement of resistance. Peace can never happen between the colonizer and the colonized. Human rights speeches, calls for negotiations, collaboration, very trurs are only lures if we forget that only the defeat of the Zionist project will end the oppression. Any other way-and this is perhaps the main issue-helps to legitimize, consciously or not, the criminalization of the armed resistance and those who support it, presented as entrying this pacifist path of capitulation which does not not said his name.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    The future of the Palestinians does not reside in a simple defeat of the Zionist extreme right by the establishment of an "democratic Israeli and law" which would be rid of the Apartheid policy; In reality and all the history of occupied Palestine demonstrates it: whether on the left or right, no Zionist group in power has denied its colonial settlement nature, none can be qualified as fascist that the group today at the head of the entity. Zionism is not reformable and even less amendable and any solidarity naively or intentionally calling for its democratization is in reality another side used to whiten it. The release of all Palestine, from the sea to the Jordan, and the return of all refugees will go through the only possible way in an anti -colonial war: that of the armed struggle.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    So, while the Palestinian National Liberation Movement has been entering a new historical stage of its struggle in recent months, we must clearly express our support: unconditional support, without detours, alongside the Resistance, all resistance and its military actions for the destruction of the Zionist entity and its colonial project, the establishment of the national liberation project throughout historical Palestine and for the defense of the right to return of all refugees. In these times of chaos and in France of fierce repression, intimidation and threats of dissolution, infiltration and deviations of all kinds, we reaffirm the conscious commitments which are ours recalled in this text and by our Palestine compass that 'is Georges Abdallah's fight.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Because if there is a historical and unwavering support for the heroic resistance and army of the Palestinian people, it is the one that fighter Georges Abdallah has always shown by his actions and expressed in his statements. This commitment-since his first actions as an activist when he opposed arms in hand to the interests of the imperialists in the Middle East and the attacks of their "operational base" that is the Zionist entity until today Hui - has never deviated, not even facked! True to the watchword of the FPLP of the 1970s "to strike the enemy wherever he is" is for armed actions accomplished in France by his organization, the Farl, that justice condemned him in 1987 to Life prison. The remarks he then made during the his lawsuit transformed into a revolutionary gallery today resonate in particular with regard notably to the genocide in Gaza and what Western imperialism -with the United States of America -is Ready to commit as crimes to maintain its hegemony in the region: so he did not note this "abyss that separates your legal world from our real world (...) This peace established by your system, maintained by the annihilation of millions of 'men in our peripheries regions ”.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    The 40 years of incarceration that the relentlessness of the French state imposed on Georges Abdallah could not break the unshakable resistance of this fighter who fell into the hands of the enemy: despite the barbarism of this detention, this internationalist revolutionary and The communist that he is never denied anything from his fight which is also ours-anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, anti-fascist and anti-Zionist, in support of the Palestinian Revolution, to his glorious resistance, to popular masses in struggle and for The emancipation of oppressed peoples all over the world.
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Georges Abdallah is not only a resistant; It is itself a symbol of the resistance and it is well for what it represents that the French state continues to keep it in prison despite the two court decisions authorizing its release. The cause of our comrade is intrinsically linked to our support for Palestine. That no action, initiative, gathering, demonstration happens without being chanted, displayed, written our requirement and in particular through this watchword which should never be truncated from its two components: "Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Release Georges Abdallah! " - Because one gave himself entirely to his cause and the other cannot leave this torch of his resistance to the hands of the enemy. All those, in France and elsewhere, in solidarity with Palestine, must demand at every moment and wherever we are the liberation of this fighter of the Palestinian Liberation Movement. And what better support can we bring to the Palestinian resistance except by putting pressure on our own imperialism to tear from this enemy one of its historic fighters!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Since June 8, a new phase has opened up in this long battle that its support leads to its release: while mobilization, in the field, in the diversity of its expressions, continues to increase, Georges Abdallah agreed to launch a new legal offensive by filing a tenth request for liberation-expulsion to its country Lebanon. Let us support by our actions the approach of Georges Abdallah by making it resonate everywhere throughout the time of the examination of his new request and accentuate always the pressure on the French state by our ever more increased mobilization and at all times!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    It is in this sense and taking into account this new phase that we are once again calling for an international month of actions for the release of Georges Abdallah from March 6 to April 6, 2024, - Date of the 14th demonstration before the Center Penitentiary of Lannemezan. That during this time coordinated a thousand initiatives flourish everywhere in France and internationally for its release and there, even for its combat in solidarity with historic Palestine!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Georges Abdallah is in prison for the political fight that has been his, for his positions and his ideals that he never ceased to proclaim and never deny. It was for his emancipation ideas that Georges Abdallah embarked on the struggle. It is for his ideas and resistance that he is still detained today. It is for his ideas and his revolutionary fight that we support him and that we demand his release! For victory or victory!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Palestine live, live and defeat! Release Georges Abdallah!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Let's continue the fight! Let's free Georges Abdallah!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    May a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish for his release!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    Honor to all those who fight for his release!
   </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
    It is together and only together, comrades, that we will defeat!

<p>
   In recent days we have learned of a great advance in the struggle to direct the female movement in Colombia along the revolutionary path, some companions who distribute
   <em>
    Workers Revolution
   </em>
   And they support the activities, they have met with workers from different sectors in the center of the country, thus consolidating a nucleus of activists to advance in the construction of the revolutionary female movement to the heat of the preparation of 8M as a combative and revolutionary commemoration in the streets in the streets .
  </p>
<p>
   Thus, we decided to inform the proletariat, emphasizing the companions, so that in practice they are encouraged to take that step, to strengthen the struggle of women next to the fight of the working class. One of the companions distributor, whom we will call Clara, told us through an interview, more of this advance and invites us to the march of International Women's Day.

<em>
    -Compa please tell readers about this experience
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    -Well clear:
   </em>
   Basically, with the help of a companion of the trade union movement, we set out to bring together some companions around the preparation of the 8M, with the intention of achieving greater unity regarding the character of International Women's Day, but not only stay there; We understand the call that from
   <em>
    Workers Revolution
   </em>
   The female movement was made, proposing that it was necessary very basis of oppression that women suffer.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    -What was achieved with this meeting?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    -Well clear:
   </em>
   A lot, it was a beautiful meeting of working women of industrial sectors, services, education and some unemployed companions. Very conscious women and activists in their respective struggles, activists and brave who understand that the struggle we must face goes beyond formal equality, rights. Aware of its role in the development of society, but also recognizing itself as a fundamental part in the very transformation of this capitalist society.
  </p>
<p>
   We managed to consolidate a group of activists to promote the conformation of the revolutionary female movement through the formation of committees, this same core is recognized as a committee, which identified with this work and whose initial work was the formation of a block for the march for the march , assimilating both previous, as well as 8m.
  </p>
<p>
   I want to add that in addition to women, we also have the support of a partner of
   <em>
    Workers Revolution
   </em>
   willing to contribute to this great task, which is something that also differentiates us from feminism, that in marches or meetings have rejected us for wanting to involve men to this commemoration.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    -What tasks are considered for this committee in process?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    -Well clear:
   </em>
   First of all, it is necessary to consolidate it, since this depends on the impulse to work. At the same time, our intention is that through our work we can bring more partners to work with us, but also to the fact that more committees are built by sectors, in companies, in neighborhoods, in universities, in villages and wherever.
  </p>
<p>
   We would like this example to encourage other women to work for giving their struggle a truly revolutionary sense.
  </p>
<p>
   On the 8M day we set out the participation in block, but also, take these ideas to the thousands of women who will be in the streets, with the slogans, with our banners, which are those of the proletariat and with the MFR platform that we are going to be distributing in Bogotá and in other cities with the support of the companions of Ro.
  </p>
<p>
   Subsequently, a necessary evaluation of the work carried out and the planning will come to continue shaping the women's committees.
  </p>
<p>
   -Thanks companion, we hope this effort has the expected results. Finally we ask you to invite readers to leave this 8M with the call they defined.
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    -Well clear:
   </em>
   In fact we invite all the women who read us and the fellow men who are consistent with the proletarian cause, to go out this Friday, March 8, commemorating the International Day of Combative and Revolutionary Women.
  </p>
<p>
   We will meet at the Ministry of Labor at 4:00 pm, there you can find the block mainly for the red of our flags, but also by the banner of the distributors of
   <em>
    Workers Revolution
   </em>
   With the main slogan.
  </p>
<p>
   But I also want to invite those who are interested and interested in participating in this initiative and be part of a new female movement, to be contacted personally in the march or in the mail by amfradelante@gmail.com.
  </p>
<p>
   Gracias.
  </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
   We thank the partner for sharing with the movement this beautiful experience and for taking this huge flag in their hands. It should be remembered that our communication channels are also open if they want to get in touch with the companions, tell us about their processes or form new revolutionary women committees, see you on the street on 8m.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
  Women, fight and make resistance!
 </h2>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The class struggle rages all over the world. No matter where we look, we see the wars, the folk murders, the blood baths and the massacres that imperialism triggers in a desperate attempt to escape its impending downfall. Imperialism, which brings wealth and prosperity to the exploitors and poverty and misery to the exploits, is in deep crisis, nourished by the ongoing struggle among the people of the world who bravely and stubbornly fight against the yoke of oppression. This dying beast's grimace is especially ugly in Palestine, where Yankee imperialism with its Israeli butchers-also supported by German imperialism! - Drives the abominable genocide of the Palestinian people forward, who keeps the resistance tab high and defends it with their blood. Although the enemy is armed for the teeth and equipped with the latest technology, the Palestinian people struggle fearlessly with all the means they have available and prove day after day that the victory is theirs. The role of the women of the people - even in the national resistance front of the Palestinian people - is by no means passive or limited to mere "support work", on the contrary, the women in our class and people fight in the front line!
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Women's participation in the decades -long heroic struggle of the Palestinian people has existed as long as this battle itself, and the rest of the world is no different; The best examples of this are the folk wars in Peru, India, Turkey and the Philippines. Everywhere fighting, the women get up too and show that half of the sky is theirs and that they will conquer it!
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  In this country, too, the women in our class are double oppressed - of imperialism and the patriarchy - and therefore have double reason to fight. Each of us can feel it every day. We are forced to let ourselves be utilized at work, often under miserable conditions, and at the same time it is expected that we take care of the children and the household without pay, not to mention relatives who need care. Our bosses fill their pockets, and if we and our class brothers no longer give them a profit, they let us fall into unemployment or short -term work from one day to the next and rob our last salary.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The bourgeois state does everything it can to maintain this condition; After all, its own existence depends on it. It is therefore not surprising that we are the first to be affected by cuts, while the big money is invested in weapons deliveries and buildup so that the German state can secure its imperialist interests in the world, whether in Ukraine or in the so -called » Middle East". After the government, with Olaf Scholz at the forefront, recently moved around the money in the money in the bourgeois interest in unconstitutional way, the billions that are now missing, including be picked up by cutting the social expenses. As always, the burden is put on the shoulders of the working class. The planned cuts, e.g. In citizens' services, we will hit us women particularly hard, as we in Germany still serve almost 20% less than men, while we are almost ten times more often single parents and therefore more often depend on financial support. We have also been waiting for over a year for the promised "basic protection for children", but more than every fifth child in Germany is still living in poverty and there is no prospect of improvement. The situation is not better when it comes to childcare: Although all children from the age of the year are entitled to a place in a day care center, almost 400,000 seats throughout Germany are missing, especially in the working quarters. The few day care institutions that exist, as well as schools, leisure homes and other childcare facilities are systematically understaffed, cut to the bone and are allowed to fall: yet another factor that forces us into unemployment! The rulers are also only too happy to save our health: In addition to the already miserable health care for the entire working class, we are women facing a huge reduction of birth rooms and maternity wards, a huge lack of gynecologists and clinics performing abortions. And when we feel the effects of the patriarchy, for example through domestic violence, the perpetrator is in most cases not prosecuted, but the woman is simply sent to a women's crisis center. And even it is only if you are lucky, because women crisis centers are also in short supply, as opposed to civil law.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  All the state gives us is empty promises. Any apparent improvement is nothing but breadcrumbs thrown to us from time to time to keep our mouth shut. For there can be no improvement to us in this rotten society. As long as imperialism exists, the utilization and repression of us of us will also exist. One cannot be smashed without the other because the foundation of both is the same: private property. Only the united battle with our class brothers for a classless society can create the basis for our emancipation. To serve this goal, we need a class -conscious women's movement that is fighting for the reconstitution of Germany's Communist Party and our actual liberation!

   The KKE is well aware that one of the main terms that 
 must satisfy in order to be recognized (even more) as 
 System interlocutor is
   <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">
    to 
 Do not dispute foreign bosses and dependency
   </b>
   . To comply with the 
 term this,

    does not hesitate to proceed to 
 right review of the story by attempting to adjust (or rape) the 
 reality to 'fit' in his pursuit

  </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">
   There is no doubt that KKE positions have serious 
 implications not only on theoretical level but also on a political level, 
 Trade union, kinematic. At a time when the country has turned into a 
 Huge basis, which the EU and the US dictate policies and co -sharing 
 budgets,
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   which huge amounts 
 They are spent on the purchase of military equipment, which daily government and 
 bourgeois class give their credentials to local and foreign bosses, rushing 
 to send military assistance to Ukraine and participate with warships 
 In "defensive" EU missions to the Red Sea, the "revolutionary purity" 
 of the KKE is expressed in practice by submitting proposals of law to Parliament and 
 "Struggle" for a good representation in the next European Parliament.
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   How far is SYRIZA that in 2014 deleted 
 The phrase for the "American -born junta" from its anniversary announcement? 
 By the system agents that tone in the name and interests of the US, 
 EU, NATO but they speak with emotion about the ... message of the Technical University?
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   With whatever narrative that occurs each time, 
 Eventually the KKE is serving the same target:
   <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">
    To 
 The foundation of bourgeoisie - power in the country remains untouched. 
 He had this line in the uprising of the Technical University. This line has and 
 now
   </b>
   . The line of hostility in the occupation and disengagement of her 
 but also war in anti -imperialist slogans (as advanced) finds 
 Her "maturity" in today's line: "Anti -imperialism was wrong".
   <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">
    This is the same direction as another 
 wrapper
   </b>
   .
  </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">
   This is not the first time the KKE has "correcting" the people. Him 
 people who for half a century out on the streets every November 17 participating in 
 Large rallies and marches to the US Embassy. Because not 
 He forgets who are the murderers of the peoples and who those who bleed the soil 
 that is pressing. So let's ask the KKE reviewers: There is a need today 
 assembly
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   movement against 
 War and imperialism?
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   It makes sense 
 Do we ask for the bases to leave? To make up the struggle of the working class and 
 of the people and the goals for leaving the EU and NATO? The sinking attack on 
 Rights of the working people and youth, which these days took 
 On the way students, students and farmers,
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   is related or not to EU plans, 
 of the OECD, the US and the submission of the bourgeoisie to their demands?
   <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>
   It is ultimately meaningful to walk every year 
 at the US Embassy? (Or maybe a course in the BSE offices will 
 better serve the class anti -capitalist purity they embrace?)
  </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">
   For us the answer is more than obvious. THE 
 Anti -imperialist struggle is an integral part of the struggle of the people and the 
 youth and is a red cloth not only for imperialists but also for 
 The local bourgeoisie that serves them and for every system of the system. No, 
 The fighters of the Technical University did not make a mistake. Neither those who, every November 17, with 
 raised fists and steady consistency, fill the streets and walk 
 toward the biggest yacht of terrorists

    On April 19, 2023, a Chamber of the Superior Court composed of Judges MR Shah and CT Ravikumar annulled the Absolution and returned the matter to the Superior Court for a new consideration.

<p>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
     Saibaba, who is in a wheelchair and has a disability of 90%, was sentenced by a court of first instance in 2017 for allegedly having links with the proscribed Communist Party of India (Maoist) and a frontal organization, the Revolutionary Democratic Front .
    </span>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
     He had been sentenced to life imprisonment.
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
    In its 2022 ruling, the Superior Court said that the order of sanction issued to process the accused in the case in accordance with the provisions of the Law (prevention) of illegal activities was “bad from the legal point of view and invalid. ”
   </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
    The court had said that although the State must fight terrorism with "unwavering resolution", a democratic civil society cannot sacrifice due legal process for the perception of a danger to national security.
   </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
    Last year, the special rapporteur of the United Nations, Mary Lawlor, had said that Saibaba's persistent detention by India was a

     "Inhuman and meaningless act"
    </span>
</a>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
    that should end.
   </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
     Lawlor, who has been in contact with the Indian government in relation to the case, said that UN human rights experts have repeatedly raised serious concerns about their processing.
    </span>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
     His arrest was declared arbitrary by the UN working group on arbitrary detention in an opinion issued in 2021, he said.
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Mr. Saibaba has been arrested in a high security barracks in incompatible conditions with his status as a wheelchair user," said the UN expert.
    </span>
<span style="box-sizing: inherit; vertical-align: inherit;">
     "Its 8 × 10 feet cell has no windows and a wall made of iron bars, which exposes it to extreme climatic conditions, especially the scorching heat of the summer."

  In the state of Pernambuco in the northeast of Brazil, the city of Escada has occurred through poor farmers for several days. The reason for these massive street blocks is the murder of the poor farmer Deyvison Batista da Silva, which was arrested by the military police for no reason in the afternoon of February 21 and then arrested.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Deyvison stood on the day of his murder and spoke to two friends as three military police officers with their motorcycles and started to harass him. In the further course, the three police officers grabbed, including the bull with the nickname "Pitbull" Deyvison, which is infamous for his aggressiveness among the local population and hit him. It was then "Pitbull" which deyvison shot into the face up close.

  Deyvison was then taken to a hospital and banished without the possibilities of family visits to isolation. Reports from residents tell that the military police have cordoned off the hospital against Deyvison's relatives and refused to construct any access to allegations against Deyvison. And in fact, as in so many cases, the military police would have been armed with the Deyvison, which was contested by all witnesses of the attack. Deyvison leaves his woman and his unborn child in the 7th month.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A few hours after the death of Deyvison, the residents of Escada to block the BR-101 motorway with burning tires. The next day, the residents of Escada continued their actions in great intensity by taking three places in siege. A bridge in the city center was blocked, a police station was blocked by the battalion of the battalion of the military police by demonstrators and the BR-101 motorway again. On the third day on February 23, the residents again stood on the highway with burning tires and also flee the fire brigade to escape the burning barricades.

  The democratic and revolutionary newspaper "A Nova Democracia" writes the powerful actions and the strength of the intensity of the blockades the consistent and adamant attitude of the residents of the city of Escada, which no longer tolerate the reactionary violence by the police and with decisions justice Deyvison and his wife demand.

  The Union of Migrant Workers in Europe (AGEB) celebrated the 5th anniversary of its establishment by organizing an event in Zurich, Switzerland, on Saturday, March 2, with the motto “Let’s Organize the Resistance against Imperialism”.
 </p>
<p>
  In the opening speech, it was mentioned that AGEB was founded in March 2019, with the motto “We come from history, we walk to the future”, with the claim of being the historical defender of the 52-year tradition and accumulation of struggle, by taking the teachings of communist leader Comrade İBRAHİM KAYPAKKAYA as a guide.
 </p>
<p>
  The activity started with a moment of silence in memory of those who became immortal in the struggle to create a free world without borders, classes and exploitation, and all the revolutionaries and communists who became immortal in the struggles against imperialism, fascism and reaction all over the world.
 </p>
<p>
  Then, a representative of AGEB Coordination made the opening speech. In it, it was stated: „If we are alive, our red blood must boil with the fire of inexhaustable forces. The coming process will create strong opportunities to escalate the anti-imperialist, anti-fascist and anti-feudal struggle. We must be on a course of struggle that is widespread, strong and effective among immigrant workers, that elevates the class struggle, that deepens the contradictions and turns them into a struggle, not calming them down.“
 </p>
<p>
  Then, a video was shown with various sections of activities in AGEB’s 5-year history of struggle. After the video, researcher-writer
  <strong>
   Murat Cakir
  </strong>
  made a presentation including his evaluations and analyzes of the political process in Europe.
 </p>
<p>
  Following the presentation, a poetry recital was given by a member of
  <strong>
   the MAVİ YOL POETRY GROUP
  </strong>
  , which is a component of AGEB and produces artistic works within
  <strong>
   the Swiss-Turkish Workers Federation
  </strong>
  . Afterwards, the symposium titled ”
  <strong>
   Political situation in Europe and our priority tasks
  </strong>
  ” started.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Representatives of embarrassing, adhk, avg-conno
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   One-kar
  </strong>
  organizations attended the symposium as speakers.
 </p>
<p>
  Following the presentation the participants were given the possibility to speak out to express their questions, suggestions and opinions.
 </p>
<p>
  In the last part of the event, the Music Group, which is a component of AGEB and carries out artistic works within
  <strong>
   the Austrian Workers’ and Youth Federation-ATIGF, took the stage.
  </strong>
  The event ended after the music concert.

But regarding this Maoist casualties, nowadays these figures given by the old Indian State are being questioned. In the Chhattisgarh district the repression against the Indian people has been exacerbated and there have been several reports of new fake encounters among alleged Maoists and the repressive forces from the old Indian State. District villagers point out that the alleged Maoist casualties achieved by the Indian repressive forces are false,

According to the UN, 360,000 residential units, more than half of the homes in Gaza, have been damaged or destroyed. 132 water wells are damaged or destroyed and only 11 out of 35 hospitals are partially functioning.

In videos by the bourgeois media continuous shouting of “Slaughterer!” is clearly heard in the background, while the media either ignored it, or made claims such as that people were shouting to congratulate the new president. It is even shown in the videos that the new president is discussing the protests with the out-going president, and even pointing at the protest.

<strong>
     Milei's Argentina is left over 20 million people
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   On Friday, March 1, Milei arrived at Congress, which he had described as "rats nest", surrounded by an immense security operation with thousands of troops. Inside the Congress did not talk about rats. He set up a careful filming of the enclosure where he only focused on official legislators and specially selected "applauders."
  </p>
<p>
   In his speech he raised his strategic plan, reiterating the program of the most reactionary and fascist sector of the ruling classes. Many of those points had already been driven during the videlist dictatorship, menemism and macrismo. As usual, he lying again with the inflation figures, he attacked the millions of people who retired with a moratorium (because they worked in black all their lives), and reopened the door to the privatization of retirement.
  </p>
<p>
   In his hatred of unions and popular organizations, Milei returned with the old oligarchic project to reform the union elections, limiting the mandates of their leaders. He would never think of stating that, in the Jockey Club, the AEA or the Rural Society the same was done.
  </p>
<p>
   The president announced the closure of the Official Agency Télam, whose workers mobilized on Monday 4 "to defend the National News and Advertising Agency and those who work on it."
  </p>
<p>
   He did not devote a word to the situation of those affected by his policy. He did not talk about the lack of food in the dining rooms, the salary loss of the workers, or the Sablazo to retirement and pensions. Nor of the brutal increases in services, transport, fuels. With total hypocrisy he said that thanks to his policy they lowered rents. He just asked for "patience and trust", nor spoke of production, industry, commerce or anything that has to do with the concrete life of the millions that inhabit this soil.
  </p>
<p>
   His plan is for an Argentine that there are at least 20 million people left over. Brutally punishes the people with inflation, adjustment and delivery. It does not reach him with the applaud of Congress.
  </p>
<p>
   On the end of the speech Milei opened the doors to those governors who are subordinated to apply that plan that is graphs in the 10 points that “May Pact” pretentiously called (see box). Of course, for the provinces to turn to the provinces, these governors have to yield to the extortion of previously guaranteeing the approval of the Omnibus law and the validity of the DNU. It intends to force, in complicity with macrismo, a majority in Congress and also support in justice to apply that plan.
  </p>
<p>
   For doubts, Milei said in an interview with the British media
   <em>
    Financial Times
   </em>
   , that, if Congress does not accompany him, he will try to put the reforms by decree.
  </p>
<p>
   What hides is that after the active national unemployment of January 24, and the multiple workers, peasant and popular struggles that toured the Argentine summer, failed with its Bus Bus bill and has not been able to obtain triumphs in Congress until now.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>
     2.
    </strong>
<strong>
     Workers and popular struggles grow
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   Inflation raises in the popular sectors. Hunger grows in the neighborhoods and in the field. According to CAME (Argentine Confederation of the Medium Enterprises) in February, retail sales fell 25.5% in relation to February 2023. In food that fall was 33.3%.
  </p>
<p>
   The recessive policy of the government causes thousands of layoffs, in the State and in many branches of the private sector, as reported by construction workers mobilizing the Ministry of Labor.
  </p>
<p>
   The recession reaches thousands of small and medium enterprises, and large monopolies such as Acindar, which suspends its four plants for a month, and Topper, which says goodbye to Tucumán.
  </p>
<p>
   The same day that Milei spoke in Congress, fuel prices, electric and water rates in the amb, gas, sanitary prepaids.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with the terrible flood that the people suffered in the province of Corrientes, with hundreds and hundreds of evacuees, the government of Milei did not say a single word.
  </p>
<p>
   On February 22 and 23, hundreds of route cuts, acts, popular pots and marches claimed for food assistance to the dining rooms in the face of the very serious food social situation that causes the adjustment and delivery policy.
  </p>
<p>
   On 2/28, an act was held in Córdoba remembering René Salamanca, leader of the Smata Córdoba and a member of the Central Committee of the PCR, kidnapped by the genocidal dictatorship.
  </p>
<p>
   In CABA they mobilized by the salaries owed cooperatives of AySA, and also workers and cooperatives who worked in arrangements and construction in the popular neighborhoods.
  </p>
<p>
   The aeronautical unions made a massive national unemployment. They denounce that Caputo broke the salary agreement that had already been signed.
  </p>
<p>
   In Rosario a historic sovereign sample was made of oath to the flag. A wide call had a shocking deployment, at the age of 212 years of the creation of our flag by Manuel Belgrano.
  </p>
<p>
   On March 4, teachers of guilds linked to the CGT stopped and made mobilizations for their salaries and funds to launch the educational system.
  </p>
<p>
   The National Peasant Federation, together with organizations of small producers, cooperatives of the regional economies, carried out a national day of struggle, with vegetables and acts throughout the country. Milei's policy, with inflation and devaluation lead to ruin and despair to thousands and thousands of small producers.
  </p>
<p>
   The women's movement advances with its assemblies throughout the country, preparing a massive day on 8/3, denouncing hunger, violence, femicides and Milei's DNU.
  </p>
<p>
   The nations and native peoples, who historically suffered genocides of the landowner oligarchy to take over their lands have also prepared to face this policy.
  </p>
<p>
   In the Autonomous CTA, with the participation of colleagues from the state of state and the Conadu H, it was decided Milei adjustment and delivery policy.
  </p>
<p>
</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>
     3.
    </strong>
<strong>
     In a world in dispute, the Malvinas are Argentinas
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   Milei also clashes with the imperialist dispute that shakes Argentina. He kneels before "West": United States, Great Britain and also Israel. He hugs with Trump betting that he wins the United States elections in November 2024, and supports "Bolsonarism" against Lula in Brazil. He needs to fulfill the IMF and intends to advance in his policy of delivering to Great Britain the sovereignty of Malvinas and other islands and waters of the South Atlantic and Antarctica.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Therefore, for the first time in an opening of sessions in Congress since 1983, he did not say a word about our Falkland Islands in his speech.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   He had already declared a admirer of Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister who led the colonial war against Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
   Diana Mondino, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said: "Malvinas islanders must decide their own destiny." British falsehood. They are British in a colonial occupation. The United Nations say it.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei met with British Chancellor Cameron. Our sovereign rights in Malvinas and more than 4 million km of sea were in the background. Days later, Cameron made a provocative trip to Malvinas. Mondino's "answer" was to invite him to meet.
  </p>
<p>
   Now England expanded an exclusion zone around the San Pedro Islands, from 283 thousand to about 449 thousand square kilometers from Argentine territory. There has been no official response.
  </p>
<p>
   They negotiate the arrival of a Yankee aircraft carrier and the construction of a base and a port.
  </p>
<p>
   Oil concessions favor British companies, in Tierra del Fuego and Buenos Aires. Laws 26,659 and 26,386 are not fulfilled, which prohibit oil and fishing farms in the national territory to those who have direct or indirect relationship with Malvinas. The Gaucho Rivero law prohibits the use of national ports by British ships.
  </p>
<p>
   The submission to the English of Milei in the Malvinas issue is worse than that of Menem-Di Tella with their "carnal relations", and that of Macri-Malcorra with its Foradori-Duncan Agreement.
  </p>
<p>
   It relies on the management of Vice President Victoria Villarruel, daughter of Officer VGM Eduardo Villarruel, who uses the Malvinas issue to claim the dictatorship and support the demalvinization of Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   This vestpatria policy is very dangerous. Argentina is a country in dispute in a world in which World War factors grow. A world in which Russian President Putin warned about the "tragic consequences" if any country sent allies to Ukraine. "We also have weapons capable of achieving objectives in their territory."
  </p>
<p>
   A world in which Israel continues with its brutal genocide of the Palestinian people. In that world, many imperialist powers, such as the United States, China, Russia, Japan and European countries, fight for Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>

    </strong>
<strong>
     Prepare and prepare the masses
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   Milei is a serial liar. Future invents a "Argentina power" as long as it does not deliver food to the dining rooms, says goodbye to tens of thousands of workers, take over the State funds for the provinces. And kneel before the IMF, USA, England and others.
  </p>
<p>
   Now he tries to gain time with the "May Pact" that was quickly supported by Macri and his henchmen.
  </p>
<p>
   In his speech he threatened that, if they accept well, and if we do not go to the conflict.
  </p>
<p>
   It is a necessity for the people and the Argentine nation twisting the arm to this disastrous policy.
  </p>
<p>
   From the PCR and its JCR, from the beginning of the Milei government, we have been working for the widest unit of the workers and popular sectors, listening and arguing with many Milei voters who are climbing their policy.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei and his allies are committed to deepening the political, economic, cultural and social division in our homeland. You need to divide and destroy popular forces. That is why from Congress, he summoned the opportunists to join their strength. And announced that
   <strong>
    He will work to destroy social, union and popular organizations.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   We remain at the forefront of the struggles for popular emergencies and against delivery and repression. From there we work to expand the unit. To give him time is to allow Milei to advance with his measures, which would only worse the situation of the great masses.
  </p>
<p>
   But day by day a situation advances in which it can be generated
   <strong>
    an objective revolutionary situation,
   </strong>
   As stated by the CC of our PCR at the beginning of January, remembering the experience of the 2001 popular rebellion:
   <strong>
    Argentinazo
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   As seen in the national strike of January 24, and in the struggles of truck drivers, oil, state, teachers and many more unions,
   <strong>
    The working class was at the head of the confrontation with Milei and its partners.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   In addition, social organizations grow in the face of hunger and unemployment. They mobilize retired and pensioners. The organization and struggle of the peasantry grows. And movements emerge in all lands, as has been seen in women, young people, culture, cooperatives, SMEs, and many more.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    A new active national strike is necessary.
   </strong>
   Throughout the country they grow
   <strong>
    Multisectoral
   </strong>
   that unite the workers and popular forces, with an extraordinary breadth. We fight to be
   <strong>
    Coordinating Centers
   </strong>
   of the labor and popular struggle. That is the way to
   <strong>
    Drink his arm
   </strong>
   to Milei's policy and open the way to the conquest of
   <strong>
    Another policy and another government, in favor of the people
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   In the fight, we join with broad Peronist masses, also Catholics, to which Pope Francis sent his clear defense orientation of the poorest, in front of Milei's opportunistic attempt with his visit. Also the unit with other popular and national forces.
  </p>
<p>
   In this situation, we work to advance the accumulation of revolutionary forces, incorporating thousands into the PCR and the JCR, offering them a struggle.
   <strong>
    It is our duty to prepare and prepare the masses so that these changes are in favor of the working class and the people and open a revolutionary path.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   In the midst of everyday struggles, we advance with tributes to our dear Otto Vargas, first general secretary of our party, five years after his death. On March 15, the JCR organizes a tribute to Otto in CABA, in which the Secretary General of the PCR, Jacinto Roldán, will speak.
  </p>
<p>
   These activities are central to reaffirm our revolutionary objectives, the same for which we founded our party 56 years ago.

   The situation in universities is very serious. To give an idea of their magnitude, they are 60 universities distributed throughout the country, study almost two million young people and we work about 160,000 teachers and some 40,000 auxiliary workers, not teachers. That is, we are one of the distributions of the largest national state and in turn with an impact on two million young people, which mean two million families. So it is a very delicate issue.
  </p>
<p>
   The situation is very serious because from the budget point of view the government applies the budget called extension budget. This is the same budget value that was approved last year, year 2023, sends that money now with a year of inflationary depreciation. Normally there is a new budget that is updated by inflation, and even if these extension budgets, because it has already passed with the government of Alberto Fernández, that Congress does not approve the budget, then legally they have approved the previous year, but then the power Executive makes reinforcements that correspond by inflation, because that is basic.
  </p>
<p>
   Well, Milei is not doing it, with which the money that universities have to work in January and February is a third of what we should have if we update it for inflation. For example, at the university where I work, which is the University of Comahue, from the Rector's There were 240 million.
  </p>
<p>
   That is, the situation is very serious, so a large part of the higher and rector councils, they say that just as we can endure three months, then we have to close the door, because there will be no money or to pay the light. It must even be said, and it is a very thick issue, when the increases in light rates arrive, there will be a very delicate situation, because the type of expenses of that nature in institutions such as universities, with Very large buildings, night schedules, etc., is very high. So, in that sense the situation is very serious.
  </p>
<p>
   And in the salary, we charged a 6%salary increase in December, inflation was 25%, in January nothing, 0%, inflation was 20%, and in February we just charged 16%, that is, we are almost 50% loss of purchasing power in three months. That is why we are discussing the need to go out to fight for our salary and go out to fight in defense of the public university.
  </p>
<p>
   Well, in the country there is money, it is a very rich country, what is being done with all this, and it is worth everyone, it is a transfer of income from the majority of the population to the sectors concentrated in the economy. That is done with the liquefaction of salaries for inflation, with layoffs, with the closure of distribution and with the recession. And now that affects, we are already seeing it with the acindar factory, for example, of Villa Constitución. There is a sales fall because nobody has a weight to spend, therefore companies also begin to have a loss of sales and begin the suspensions, layoffs and closures. It is the same that happened during the military dictatorship, the so -called deindustrialization, openness of the economy to the world, which is actually leaving the national industry that competes with products imported from countries where they charge $ 20, $ 30 per month of salary, loan, lo la which makes it impossible to compete with that, with which the national industry breaks.
  </p>
<p>
   We, in relation to the immediate, this month, next month, we have to achieve unity, mobilization and strength to tear salary increases into the government. This is so, we cannot wait.
  </p>
<p>
   And in turn we have to achieve unity, mobilization and strength to tear the minimally necessary budget increases into the Government. This already happened with Macri, who when he assumed made an extraordinary adjustment; He assumed in December 2016, in May we made a mobilization of more than 50,000 students, teachers and non -teachers and there Macri had to open the tap for universities to work a little better, but it was because we did that massive mobilization.
  </p>
<p>
   Now we have to do the same as Macri because the government is speculating to see how much we endure, whether we do or do nothing. If we do nothing, the situation will be deepened and we will be worse. At the same time we have to gather a lot of strength because it is a very bad government, which does not care what people suffer. That immediately.
  </p>
<p>
   In the medium term it must be discussed that this is not the exit, that this path, this course of free market as they call it is a direction that destroys the country, condemns the majority to more suffering and deepens it. That is the debate we have to give ourselves as a country, as a society.
  </p>
<p>
   Now this month we have to get the government to get the necessary increase, the minimum increases we need and the budget. That is why we are arguing, and even tomorrow [Tuesday, March 5] we have a meeting all the unions including non -teachers to go to an action measure or discuss what are the joint actions we can do. And we are promoting in universities meetings with students, with non -teaching workers, the so -called interclastation meetings, teaching cloister, non -teaching cloister and cloister students, for all together to discuss this situation. In fact there are already higher advice that are the governing bodies of the universities that have ruled, the National Rectors Council has already pronounced that the situation is critical and that they need budgetary reinforcements.
  </p>
<p>
   This is very important and you help us as a means of dissemination to the whole of the people know, that the damage that is being done is much, there are many boys who are telling the coins, now that the rentals increased, the rents increased the Collectives, some are going to fall from the university, they will not be able to go because they no longer have money to pay the collective. If there is no money on that to pay the light of universities, it is really a very large damage.
  </p>
<p>
   Today the message to our and our coworkers is: the one who does not fight loses, is a lie that in two months things will improve and now you have to make sacrifices, what they will put us is a sacrifice for life . Therefore, now we have to stop this situation and the one who does not fight will lose. So, let's join, let's get strength, let's talk well how we are going to do things, but we have to go out to claim for ours.
