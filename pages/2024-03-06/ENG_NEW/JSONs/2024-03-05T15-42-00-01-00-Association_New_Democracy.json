Palestine will win ! How many times have we chanted this slogan for so many years? How many times have we proclaimed it in the mass demonstrations of recent weeks and last months? There is no doubt that none could be held without being launched or taken over this historic watchword of clear and clear support for historical Palestine. Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Against all odds !\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Palestine lives, it will live and it will defeat by this national liberation struggle which it leads, not since 1948 but since the presence of the first settlers on its land in the 1880s. It lives by its tireless fight, since the first day and by all possible forms of struggle (revolts, general strikes, actions of sabotage and military, guerrilla war) against the ardent of Zionist colonialism which aims not only to occupy its land but also to hunt its people, or even exterminate. She lives and reminds us that the Palestinians are not victims but fighters engaged against oppression, engaged in the only possible path for their salvation: that of resistance, the law of their existence. She lives against and against everything by relentlessly facing the imperialists in the region, whose Zionist colonialism is only the bridgehead and the organic arm for economic, geostrategic and military control of the wealth of the Arab world. She lives against and against everything despite the repeated attempts to fragment the Palestinian identity, between the Palestinians of 1948, Gaza, West Bank ... Palestine lives, despite the betrayals of the Arab reactionary states which, normalization after normalization, tried in vain By their collaboration with the Zionist enemy of legitimizing the occupier and emptying the Palestinian liberation struggle of its panarabist and internationalist dimension. Palestine lives, will live and defeat despite the plans of standardization and sharing brandished each time that the resistance intensifies, despite all the attempts to liquidate its revolution and its land in the form of so-called \"peace Just and durable \", from a solution to two states or\" a state of all its citizens \", plans that the Palestinian resistance has known and will always thwart.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Until the very ranks of solidarity movements in Palestine, we hear: \"Palestine lives, but at what price!\" This price is the one that peoples have always paid to free themselves from colonialism and oppression; It is the one that the Palestinian people have paid and still pay today to overcome in their national liberation struggle. Indescriptible sufferings and endured sacrifices, thousands of martyrs in recent months but also in all of Palestinian national history are all evidence of the criminal nature of Zionism and imperialism. Faced with this barbarism, our task is not to propagate the illusion of a negotiated outcome - a \"just and lasting peace\" which would perpetuate colonial domination -, it is not to appeal to\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    the \"international community\" or to institutions controlled by imperialism. In Palestine, takes place not a \"conflict\" from which it would be possible to come out by a fantasized outcome, but a colonial war which aims to eliminate a movement of resistance. Peace can never happen between the colonizer and the colonized. Human rights speeches, calls for negotiations, collaboration, very trurs are only lures if we forget that only the defeat of the Zionist project will end the oppression. Any other way-and this is perhaps the main issue-helps to legitimize, consciously or not, the criminalization of the armed resistance and those who support it, presented as entrying this pacifist path of capitulation which does not not said his name.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    The future of the Palestinians does not reside in a simple defeat of the Zionist extreme right by the establishment of an \"democratic Israeli and law\" which would be rid of the Apartheid policy; In reality and all the history of occupied Palestine demonstrates it: whether on the left or right, no Zionist group in power has denied its colonial settlement nature, none can be qualified as fascist that the group today at the head of the entity. Zionism is not reformable and even less amendable and any solidarity naively or intentionally calling for its democratization is in reality another side used to whiten it. The release of all Palestine, from the sea to the Jordan, and the return of all refugees will go through the only possible way in an anti -colonial war: that of the armed struggle.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    So, while the Palestinian National Liberation Movement has been entering a new historical stage of its struggle in recent months, we must clearly express our support: unconditional support, without detours, alongside the Resistance, all resistance and its military actions for the destruction of the Zionist entity and its colonial project, the establishment of the national liberation project throughout historical Palestine and for the defense of the right to return of all refugees. In these times of chaos and in France of fierce repression, intimidation and threats of dissolution, infiltration and deviations of all kinds, we reaffirm the conscious commitments which are ours recalled in this text and by our Palestine compass that 'is Georges Abdallah's fight.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Because if there is a historical and unwavering support for the heroic resistance and army of the Palestinian people, it is the one that fighter Georges Abdallah has always shown by his actions and expressed in his statements. This commitment-since his first actions as an activist when he opposed arms in hand to the interests of the imperialists in the Middle East and the attacks of their \"operational base\" that is the Zionist entity until today Hui - has never deviated, not even facked! True to the watchword of the FPLP of the 1970s \"to strike the enemy wherever he is\" is for armed actions accomplished in France by his organization, the Farl, that justice condemned him in 1987 to Life prison. The remarks he then made during the his lawsuit transformed into a revolutionary gallery today resonate in particular with regard notably to the genocide in Gaza and what Western imperialism -with the United States of America -is Ready to commit as crimes to maintain its hegemony in the region: so he did not note this \"abyss that separates your legal world from our real world (...) This peace established by your system, maintained by the annihilation of millions of 'men in our peripheries regions \u201d.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    The 40 years of incarceration that the relentlessness of the French state imposed on Georges Abdallah could not break the unshakable resistance of this fighter who fell into the hands of the enemy: despite the barbarism of this detention, this internationalist revolutionary and The communist that he is never denied anything from his fight which is also ours-anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, anti-fascist and anti-Zionist, in support of the Palestinian Revolution, to his glorious resistance, to popular masses in struggle and for The emancipation of oppressed peoples all over the world.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Georges Abdallah is not only a resistant; It is itself a symbol of the resistance and it is well for what it represents that the French state continues to keep it in prison despite the two court decisions authorizing its release. The cause of our comrade is intrinsically linked to our support for Palestine. That no action, initiative, gathering, demonstration happens without being chanted, displayed, written our requirement and in particular through this watchword which should never be truncated from its two components: \"Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Release Georges Abdallah! \" - Because one gave himself entirely to his cause and the other cannot leave this torch of his resistance to the hands of the enemy. All those, in France and elsewhere, in solidarity with Palestine, must demand at every moment and wherever we are the liberation of this fighter of the Palestinian Liberation Movement. And what better support can we bring to the Palestinian resistance except by putting pressure on our own imperialism to tear from this enemy one of its historic fighters!\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Since June 8, a new phase has opened up in this long battle that its support leads to its release: while mobilization, in the field, in the diversity of its expressions, continues to increase, Georges Abdallah agreed to launch a new legal offensive by filing a tenth request for liberation-expulsion to its country Lebanon. Let us support by our actions the approach of Georges Abdallah by making it resonate everywhere throughout the time of the examination of his new request and accentuate always the pressure on the French state by our ever more increased mobilization and at all times!\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    It is in this sense and taking into account this new phase that we are once again calling for an international month of actions for the release of Georges Abdallah from March 6 to April 6, 2024, - Date of the 14th demonstration before the Center Penitentiary of Lannemezan. That during this time coordinated a thousand initiatives flourish everywhere in France and internationally for its release and there, even for its combat in solidarity with historic Palestine!\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Georges Abdallah is in prison for the political fight that has been his, for his positions and his ideals that he never ceased to proclaim and never deny. It was for his emancipation ideas that Georges Abdallah embarked on the struggle. It is for his ideas and resistance that he is still detained today. It is for his ideas and his revolutionary fight that we support him and that we demand his release! For victory or victory!\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Palestine live, live and defeat! Release Georges Abdallah!\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Let's continue the fight!
