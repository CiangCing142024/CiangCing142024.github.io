We make mass demonstrations and occupations. The Panteion for 8 weeks is finished under occupation. The government uses both the immediate repression, the cops and the invasions of the police asylum and their long hand in the schools, rectors and great -speakers to suppress our struggles and move our collective processes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Panteion's Rector, once again showing its true face and which interests it serves (those of the exploitation system) made a decision to carry out the spring semester. He decided to perform the spring semester until 28/6 and the spring exam until 26/7. The extension of the semester and the exam until the end of July comes to intensify our studies, influence students who work for the season and lead them to lose their exams and pass the systemic view that students should continue to deal with continuity And all year with our studies and nothing else. It fully utilizes the Diamantopoulou Law that sets the six months to last 13 weeks. This decision is a clear attempt to terrorize our struggle. It threatens to either stop or do lessons and exams by August. It is vindictively imposed on all of us who are mobilized against private universities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Already in a series of schools in Athens and nationwide, telephones have begun as a continuation of the releases that have been recruited to (tele) suppress our struggle against private universities. The government is using the telecommunications and the extension of the semester to remove our collective processes. To return to their regularity, the regularity of the Rights of Rights and the Individual Road. This effort should not pass. Students must bypass the blackmail of the Rector and continue massively to the overthrow of the Pierrakakis law, even if the N/S is voted on. To continue against the submission and compromise of ... diverse actions and continue with assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. To fight against both private universities and previous anti -populist laws, Law 4777, the law -framework and all the previous ones such as Diamantopoulou.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To demand, against both the Rector and the Systemic Forces and the Left forces talking about replacements, not to extend the semester and examination, to block the telecommunications and not to participate in them.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    No Extension of Semester - Examination\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Neither on paper, nor anywhere, n/s to be removed\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Public - Free Education for All\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    Not in private universities\n   </b>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n   <b>\n    EVERYTHING IN Nationwide Educational Demonstration 8/3, 12:00 in Propylaea\n   </b>\n  </li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n   <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"672\" data-original-width=\"1920\" height=\"112\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0t37aV-Z2aU1Aq2z_kjD-8L62ruKhDExrtmO3gEMjYEf5fRWdfiETdl1J_asoIxTXY3ab9Zj-rOq3Sao-fWeoouwCe6kp6yzBFA9wnmxNO7WfsWLx_WKe265xM0nWlD4n0b7KE2SiBKuc985e0EWZxilGumhBHdzkqtRMT598r7yLU04LZffWEDxgDNI/s1920/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0t37aV-Z2aU1Aq2z_kjD-8L62ruKhDExrtmO3gEMjYEf5fRWdfiETdl1J_asoIxTXY3ab9Zj-rOq3Sao-fWeoouwCe6kp6yzBFA9wnmxNO7WfsWLx_WKe265xM0nWlD4n0b7KE2SiBKuc985e0EWZxilGumhBHdzkqtRMT598r7yLU04LZffWEDxgDNI/s1920/%CE%91%CE%B3%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82%20%CE%9A%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82.png\" width=\"320\"/>\n  </div>\n  <br/>\n  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   Republished by\n   <a href=\"https://www.agonistikeskiniseis.org/athina-panteio-oxi-stin-paratasi-toy-examinoy-kai-tis-exetastikis/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Racing moves\n   </a>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b5\u03b9-\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9", "\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1", "\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf", "\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_52.html"}
