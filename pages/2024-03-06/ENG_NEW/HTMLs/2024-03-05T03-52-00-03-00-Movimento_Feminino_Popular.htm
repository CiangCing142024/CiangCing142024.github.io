Access movementFeminininopopular.com.br <br><br>  March 2, 2024 MFP Without defeating imperialism there will be no emancipation of women at a key moment in the Sacred War of Resis - Palestinian national, the United States (USA) wide its role as the largest enemy of the people's peoples. Rare are an Yankee politicians was so open, blatantly and unconditionally is nies as Joe Biden, which plays the misleading speech he intends to present as essentially distinct “demo - cracates” and “republicans”. Both rival, yes, in prey and genocide, confirming Lenin's powerful analysis that imperialism is not a policy, which can be al - the alternation of a government, but it is the upper and ultimate stage of capianism , time of reaction and violence throughout the line and anteasala of the world proletarian revolution. The Palestinian people have lived in an open prison for over 70 years, under considering economic blockade, military surveillance, routine of Zionist aggressions - both by mili forces and by the settlers - and mass expulsion. of millions of people, a situation that has come to paroxysm since the reaction to the heroic operation of the di - Lúvio al -aqsa on 7 or - tubro 2023. The reaction of Netanyahu and the sion beasts that follow him is mere demonstration of cowardice and despair before the irresistible lift of the Palestinian but - sas. Since or - Tubro Israel has murdered more than 28,000 Palestinians. And who are these people? About 70% of them are mos and children. Unconditional US support for Israel -made genocide attests to the role of imperialism as the greatest enemy of the people of the world, in its greed to dominate having - rich and imposing puppet governments and expanding its - mynic, conjuring the growing danger of its decline and ensure as super - CA - CA. Isn't that way that it has acted in the Middle East expanded for so long? For example the invasions in Iraq and Afghanistan, perm as many threats to Iran, Democratic Republic for Korea and Venezue, the funding and support for state blows in the Ukra - NIA and other former reports of the former USSR etc. The attackers do not recall such barbaries because they are strong, as they want to make the reformists believe, but because they feel the poly from their hands before the heroic and indomitable resistance and the rebellion of the oppressed. IMPERIALIS - MO imposes unfair wars as part of the world's sharing and sharing to overcome their crises. The concentration of income and in - poor masses in the world imposes unsurpassed political challenges for imperialism. Yes, data from 2023 point out that the 5 largest companies in the world have together the value of GDP of the economies of Africa, Latin America and Cari - BE. The founder of Empresa of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, one of the richest in the world, has increased by more than $ 30 million since 2020 his already bilius fortune, at the expense of showing the blood of the proleta - the third world and even the deterioration of social rights in imperialist countries. This is the path of all monopolistic companies, incompatible even with demo -creatures enshrined by the bourgeois revolution, an inevitable reason for the rise of contemporary fascism. In response to this place, in the last year, protes are raised in various parts of the world against the exploitation of the great monopolies. In England, if Daniel Alves: What is the rape price? Daniel Alves, now former Ja - Football Gador, was with four years and six months by Spanish justice - there for raping a Jo - comes in a nightclub in Barce - Canvas. The prison time (well lower, for example, as provided for in Brazilian law) was mitigated by the payment of a fine of the condemnation of 900 thousand reais, paid, as stated by its “parso” Neymar. In addition to the decrease in the sentence, Daniel Alves tries to obtain the prior departure from the prison, until the end of April, upon payment of a kind of “security”. In other words, it is a kind of bizarre “insurance rape”. Yes, how much is a rape worth? This, on the one hand, wide the hypocritical character From bourgeois ideology, which does not see human relations more than mere goods to be negotiated like any other (what the so -called “social networks” live except mercantilization, precisely, what is more human in us?), And in the case of women, as consumer objects - which can, like any objects, be priced. It can then be said that the editorial a general strike of half a million workers took the country, which undergoes a severe economic crisis by submitting the people to a fall in their condition of life. In China, a wave of mass layoffs in monopolistic companies raised the explosiveness of the protests, as happened at Jianqiao Industrial Park, in the city of Chongqinq, and in the Rebellion of Zhengzhou Province. In addition, the Chine - SA Real Estate Crisis haunts the world economy. Latin America, deded by imperialism as its backyard, also burns in rebellions such as Argentina where the reactionary government cuddled imposed an anti -povo decrease against workers and other popular masses, which respond to the height in multipurpose protes. Nor the restriction of freedoms of manifestation, expression and organization prevented revolts. Being half of the class women also argue on themselves the weight exploration. To follow with his ideals of super - power, the dying immersion maintains and immersion to secular female oppression. The campaigns taken by the press monopoly, bigwigs and famous ones about “women's rights”, “not no”, etc, are not enough for reversing the centuries of oppression. They are, in fact, pure demagogy. Only one hand of colorful paint over its true misogynist face. Without forgetting the non -negotiable need for the struggle to keep the right already conquered, it is light to believe that female emancipation can be completed in the milestones of this society. The people of the people, besides having less salary (earns 21% less than the HO - mens), the most precarious jobs (80% of informal carbackers) and are difficult to keep employing, is obliged , also, to exercise a double workday: the work of the unpaid. This unpaid domestic work, invisible and in - bruteist by the working woman, to be that the employer keeps the wages extremely low. While the women of the ruling classes buy the kitchen, clean and care of children, the women of the people are the ones who need to do these tasks, besides working outside to complement the house's income or even ensure it alone . In popular homes women are the first to get up and the last to lie down. In Brazil, this under -unavoid work is on average 21.3 hours a week. In turn, bai wages maintain the worker and his family in a precarious life condition, and are part of the gear of cyclical crises: reducing consumption and generating overproduction crises. And it is in these moments of crisis that increase all kinds of violence and Barbá - ries: extraction of wealth and greater reactionary in the countries of lacketh governments of imperialism and trauma, physical and psychological, the victim is worth 900 thousand reais? In which, essentially, this is different, say, from Afghan tribal justice, condemned as Barbara by the "West", as it is common for the "indemnity" of husbands to the families of their wives murdered with goats and pieces of land? In addition, it also falls apart, with this compensation in exchange for the sentence, any vague idea of an egalitarian “justice” for all: for the same barbaric crime of ES - Tupro (in the case of Daniel Al - Ves, the process brought to light Uncontroversial evidence), a millionaire will not respond like a poor. It is worth here in other parts of capitalist society: for the bourgeoisie, always, crime pays off. <br><br> March 3, 2024 MFP March 2024 Economic Crisis Weighs even more about women in defeat of imperialism there will be no emancipation of womenSob Luiz Inacio, the situation of working women has not changed at all despite all the promises during the last electoral period - in which the situation of the mes was exactly one of the most debated points - the lives of women of the people, especially the poorest layers, such as slum residents in cities and peasants landless or with Little land in the whole, it has not changed, neither shape nor background. During this time, Luiz Inácio and Alckmin's opportunistic government has practiced its agenda of “governance” (read: alliance with the same re -nationary coalition that is governing whatever the government, from Sarney to Bolson - RO) and appeasement with the scammers and the far right, at the expense of popular interests. Even shy measures, considered in the elections, as to the taxation of the great fortunes and the recognition of work rights for application workers, were not implemented. For the poor, by contrast, the only policy has been the increase of violence in the countryside and in the city. Another stark fact of the crop - if it is the increase in political violence, as evidenced in the recent murders of the quilombola leadership Mother Bernade - Te and Pajé Nega Pataxó, both in the state of Bahia, whose government of petista Jerônimo Rodrigues has nothing has nothing Made to reduce the extreme right estate contracts against the public lands and territory - indigenous rivers. Even more encouraged by the recent approval of the criminal temporal landmark, associations of landlords, screams and land thieves such as the “Invasion Ze - RO” group, has armed and trained real gunmen's armies to promote ile - gais repossession - , murder leadership and try to contain the struggle and land. Most of these gentlemen make up the social base of pockets and the far right, openly the return of its leader to the government and the outcome of the fascist military coup. Meanwhile, Luiz Inácio and his minister deliver the budget to their “allies” Artur Lira and other Bandados de Colori - Congress's white, as if similar to the PU - this contains the Sanha Gol - track that emanates above all Armed forces and landowners. The recurring episodes of police slaves - with the derivatives of the “Summer Operation” in Santos, which has already resulted in 54 deaths, in addition to the permanent site of the carioca favelas - dis- nudar the true reactionary civil war - Dominant of great bourgeois and landowners servants of imperialism, especially Yankee, against the people. As you have seen, to arm the police and equip the representation - are at all levels there is no spending contingency or fiscal ceiling. For health and education, funds color, the depths of professionals and structural degradation are a routine, as revealed in the inability of the state to prevent and offer care to carrier during the current dengue epidemic . In a word, to the richness, everything, for the people, nothing! The promises of public policies for the mes, which were trumped during the electoral farce, have already been forgotten. What was done was pure makeup, as is the case with the distribution of menstrual absorbers in the “Popular Pharmacy Program”, for which an endless bureaucracy is required to prove poverty, an exposure and humiliation that inhibits the search for many women. Issues such as the valorization of salary - myself and the law of salary equalization between men and women of the same profession became dead letter. Most women are without formal employment, and “see each other” as they can to support their children. Among the workers, black women lead the worst rates of always - remuneration and occupation in unprotected employment, without a formal contract and without rights. The economic crisis, unemployment and inflation weigh even more about women. According to the National Pesqui - Sample of continuous household samples, determined by IBGE, in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased inequality between men and women in the labor market. 20%, in the quarterly, increased to 25% the difference in income between men and women. They earn an average of 25% less. Work women, especially black workers, are the most penalized for hunger and unemployment - female unemployment is 55% higher than male, and 47% of women live in food safety situations. This economic release exposes us to other violence. Thus, only in the first four months of 2023 17,500 sexual violations against children or adolescents were recorded, and this cruel reality access to abortion in the current law (rape, which puts the life of the life of the law. mother and fetal anencephaly) has been increasingly difficult in public health services, forcing women to risk life to perform abortion. Dust the revolution of new democracy and popular protest! The severe economic, political and military crisis which the country has arrived is not a conjunctural fact or passing through: its roots are in the five centuries of latifunction and domination, first colonial, imperialist of - there. An economy under - litifundal and imperialism, always found and without margin for national development. Classes Doma - Nantes Lacaines of imperialism, smaller partners who are content with crumbs. Permanent Political Crisis, Frequently Volucional Situations and Recurring Military Interventions. In addition to the unbearable yoke that weighs on us people, women also wrap a fourth mountain of exploration: female oppression. ES - is expressed in the unpaid domestic work; in the inferior and prejudiced form as women are seen by macho ideology; In lower salaries and the most demeaning working conditions that focus on us, as well as several other consequences, such as self -timing, which loves us to unfortunate situations and gets sick. In this March 8th, we, from the Popular Women's Movement, make a key to women working in the countryside and the city to boost the agrarian reion and popular protest, thickening the ranks of the revolution of Nova Democracy in our country. We must, part by part and in every corner of this country, to pull what is ours by right - earth, bread, employment, until we have the government of everything, that is, power. May this memorable date, which is inscribed in the list of the dates of the internal - national proletariat, mark once again with class seal the need to connect all these fighting struggles for a fight for a Brazil and a new world, in which Sovereign Trele Red flag. National situation wars of prey around the world. There are, under imperialis - perspectives of advance for workers except those propelled by the proper chain of popular and revolutionary struggle. Women, facing protests in both the neighborhoods of imperialist countries and in the villages and slums of the oppressed countries, of brands given with men in their class only reaches - their complete emanciament with the drinking of this rotting exploration system. Editorial continuation <br><br> March 4, 2024 MFP Origin and meaning of March 8, March 8 - International Proletarian Women's Day has a special immersion in the revolutionary struggle of all peoples. The tribute to the struggle of women from the exploited and oppressed classes of all countries was proposed by Clara Zetkin - German Social Democratic Party leader - at the II Conference of Socialist Mudes in 1910, held in Denmark. Approved by the delegates, the tribute was held on different days in the first years. On March 8, 1917, at the height of a revolutionary situation, there was a march with tens of thousands of workers against hunger, war and tsarism, under the direction of the Bolsheviks in Petro - from the then capital of Russia, giving Beginning a political general strike against the Czarist Gime. These reconciliations marked the most important revolutionary PE - The Great Revolution of October in 1917 - when the Russian working class and the historical ally class, take power and begin the construction of the first homeland. So - Cialist of History, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - USSR. It is in Hornage to this rebellion of the Russian workers that the celebration of the inter - national day of prole women will be held on March 8, by the revolutionary movements - rivers of women around the world, as a mark of content of the date of the date. In the 1950s, the ruling classes reacted - they tried to suppress these historical references linked to the international communist movement, trying to transform the one into the international day of all women, exploited and exploited, oppressed and oppressed. They learned the Lie Version - that the strike of the weavers in New York, when 129 workers and 17 workers died, in a large fire locked by the bosses inside the building in flames, had occurred on March 8 and then that date passed to be celebrated internationally. Since they could not suppress the class character of a date already consolidated around the world, they then sought a struggle that happened outside the socialist territory. The defense of the bourgeoisie books, repeated in choir by opportunism and revisionism, referring to New York workers is therefore a scam. Not that the fact has not occurred, nor that the struggle of US workers is not important and is not part of the international labor movement. By the way, they are heroines of the struggle of the proletariat and the emancipation of the mu - lher. But his heroism did not occur on March 8, but on March 25, 1911. International Proletarian Women's Day was not instituted with refinement in this event, but in the great socialist revolution of October in 1917. What imperialism actually tends is to deny that March 8 is linked to the worldwide pro - and therefore belongs to exploited and oppressed masses from all over the world that combat imperialism. And this does not allow in its vain attempt to deny the revolution and to erase history the historical achievements of the working class and the peasantry directed by the Great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, under the great leadership of Lenin and Stalin . “The origin of the family, private property and state” published in 1884 by Friedrich Engels, the most important Marxist work for the historical explanation of female oppression. It demonstrates how men and women relations have changed according to the development of the human character of having to have in nature and how it reflected in the various forms of family organization to monogamy and the passage of barbarism to civilization. In the thesis of MFP “The Eman - Women's Cipa is the work of the proletarian revolution” we present a brief summary that says: "In the early form - human social formation (the genes), predominated for centuries Matriarchy, where women had pre -pondering for centuries and great political and social immersion. Matriarchy was the form of organization of the first human families prior to the emergence of private property. The emergence of private ownership, derived from the formation of surplus of production, profoundly modifies those existing social relationships. Men begin to transform the expired in the struggles between the groups for survival, in slaves, to meet the greatest labor needs. At that moment to man, to whom in the divine Until then, work was mainly fitted to the case, therefore belonged to the tools and utensils needed for their function; and in turn belonged to women the utensils linked to their function of caring mainly in agriculture and the treatment of domestic things . Thus, the new division of work will generate the preponde of male. With the production of surpluses, the problem of the inheritance that previously passed through the maternal lineage, and there was no surplus of production, was composed of few utensils. With the production of surpluses, under the property of the Ho - these will also seek recognition of inheritance for their children and society starts to organize according to the paternal line. Thus' the collapse of the maternal right was the great historical defeat of females throughout the world. The man also seized the direction of the house; converted into a servant, a slave to man's lust, a simple insight of reproduction. ' (Engels) Development of patriarchy reaches our days and to make it worth it was necessary to alter ancestral traditions, replacing them with others applied from the view of the class divided into classes. As a way, women will suffer two types of oppression: their oppression as class and the other as a gender. And the di - ferent modes of production took advantage of this situation in their favor, and in capitalism, the non -domestic work made by women have the important role of reducing the value of the workforce and increasing the lu - cro capitalist. ”Engels' concern about female oppression surpassed the theoretical aspect and being deeply linked to the labor movement, accompanied, in Germany, the struggle of prominent communist leaders such as Clara Zetkin who crashed herculean efforts to organize the union struggle of women and their incorporation into the German social democratic party. Fight that rose to the congresses of the II Tenational, resulting in a large female corporation to communist parties.
