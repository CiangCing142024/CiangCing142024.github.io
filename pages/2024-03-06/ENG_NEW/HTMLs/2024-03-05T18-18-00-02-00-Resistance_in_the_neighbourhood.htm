 True that the causes of this deep turn are indistinct. It make's them 
 indistinct on the one hand, in favor of revolutionary phraseology and ideological purity

 Silence on evidence and events that do not "fit". Above all, however, the

 They make the coup and keep a junta for 7 years. And all that 
 without even the approval of the US. And most importantly, if as a job case 
 Adopt the version of the KKE, it does not respond to why, with what goals and 
 On behalf of which 'business groups', interests and aspirations 
 they did. As for the… in favor of revolutionary approach it finally acquits the urban 
 parties who, due to their dependence and with their dependence, laid the 
 road in every respect to the American -used coup and while they saw it coming 
 They were inactive because of position and nature.

 Because with the backs of its protectors she has the power and at the same time treasures

   . Did this not happen with the 
 Memorandums? Is miserable distortion of reality that our position for the 
 dependency - ours and not the one that the KKE had previously - acquits the 
 urban class. The opposite is done with the position of the KKE. And the unveiling

 In "defensive" EU missions to the Red Sea, the "revolutionary purity" 
 of the KKE is expressed in practice by submitting proposals of law to Parliament and
