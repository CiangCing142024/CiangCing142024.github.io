After the road was first opened with the imposition of tele-examination, our struggle continues to be hit. But mass for 3 weeks remains stable, a sign that many students are willing to fight. The participation of students and teachers was missing from the course.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What was not missing was the degenerative logic between the PCC and the shape of Ara, where two slogans were heard in the same block at the same time, trying to impose.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is necessary to re -engage our processes, in the face of the passage of the bill, but also to continue the fight in the event of voted on. Abstaining from telephones and recognizing them as a means of suppressing our struggles.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": [], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/292.html"}
