There is no higher than the honor of belonging to this army. \"\n  </strong>\n  (Stalin)\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the history books show, Comrade Lenin, the great leader of the working class and the oppressed people in the world, became the second major milestone of Marxism-Leninism-Leninism-Leninism-Leninism, on January 21, 1924, and left a great legacy of invaluable value. Comrade Lenin's doctrine, who transformed the \"future world\", whose basis was laid by Marx and angel, from an abstract opportunity to a concrete reality, is still fully relevant after a century and major upheavals in the world. In order to be able to position yourself properly in the class struggle, one must accept this \"timeliness\" and orient yourself to it. This \"timeliness\" is also a cure for reformist, revisionist and parliamentary cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of all kinds. It is the guarantee of faith and determination for a communist world to be created.\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Lenin as the teacher of communism, who broke the ice and paved the way to the international reaction and revisionism\n </h4>\n <p>\n  To identify the contradictions in the history of the class struggle correctly, to understand the moments of historical fracture and to be prepared in these moments was the most outstanding feature of the entire comrade Lenin's struggle and to his immortality. After Marx 'and Engels' death, the leadership of the international proletariat was long taken over by the opportunism in the other international, and with comrade Stalin's words:\n  <strong>\n   \u201cA period in which the parties in the other international were unable to take over the theoretical struggle to free the international proletariat and the world's oppressed people from the influence of these opportunistic and class complex Social Democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle to release the international proletariat and the world's oppressed people, he developed with the founding of the communist international an organizational and fighting form that was adapted to the dynamics of the class struggle in the new period of capitalism. \u201d\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Comrade Lenin transformed the Communist Party and the communist international into a war instrument against the bourgeoisie by freeing the Communist Party and the movement of the communist international from the links of the legal battle forms:\n  <strong>\n   \"Instead of a revolutionary policy, there was limp philistinism and dirty political negotiations, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary intrigues. For the sake of, of course, 'revolutionary' resolutions and passwords were adopted ... \u201d\n  </strong>\n  , but as it \"stores in the drawers in its offices,\" freed from the grip of legal forms of combat.\n  <strong>\n   \"Meanwhile, a new period of imperialist wars and the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat approached. The old combat methods proved to be obviously inadequate and impotent against the allestage of financial capital. It became necessary to revise the entire international activities, all its working method, and to expel all philistinism, narrow -mindedness, political scam, renegatism, social wine wineism and social pacifism. It was necessary to review the entire arsenal of the second international, to throw out everything that was rusty and obsolete and forged new weapons. Without this preparation, it was useless to go to war against capitalism. Without this work, the proletariat risked being insufficiently armed, or even completely unarmed, in future revolutionary struggles. The honor of conducting this general overhaul and the general cleansing of the other internationales\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   augiastall\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   accrue to Leninism. \u201d\n  </strong>\n  (Stalin, on the basis of Leninism).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Comrade Lenin, with his genius, understood the core of the contradiction and realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off the burdens that rest on the back of the international proletariat, without fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses these The true nature of the perceptions in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary connection between the \"inner match\" and the \"outer match\", he led a double match.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Comrade Lenin left us communists The extremely important lessons that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of ruling reaction. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be cleansed of revisionism and opportunism.\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Keep Lenin's teaching high in the stricter contradictions of the imperialist system\n </h4>\n <p>\n  The imperialist system that Comrade Lenin analyzed in detail in the early 20th century has survived the last period, but the contradictions are tightened and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the dissolution of the Soviet Union and China's integration process in the capitalist system prevented the contradictions from exploding for a while, the law on the uneven development of capitalism continued, and the interimperialist rivalry developed into the \"dissolution phase\" characterized by regional wars. This shows what crisis system is in and that the previous \"solutions\" no longer work. The imperialists, who long maintained their crisis by pushing the burdens of the system over the hemispheres and reinforced the looting of the hemispheres, have also come to a blind track here.\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the explosive points of the inherent problems of the imperialist system, which has evolved in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism, is that the interimperialist struggle, which has manifested itself in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought in regional wars. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the interimperialist contradiction as one of the three most important.\n </p>\n <p>\n  We see that the development is in line with Comrade Lenin's views on the nature of imperialism and contradictions:\n  <strong>\n   \"The other contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for raw material sources, on foreign territory. Imperialism is capital exports to the sources of raw material, the insane battle for monopoly possession of these sources, the struggle for a new division of the already divided world, a struggle brought with special rage by new financial groups and powers seeking a \"place in the sun\" against the sun \"against the old groups And the powers that stubbornly hold on to what they have conquered. This insane struggle between the various capitalist groups is remarkable because it as an inevitable element includes imperialist wars, wars for the annexation of foreign territories. This circumstance, in turn, is remarkable because it leads to a mutual weakening of the imperialists, to a weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to an acceleration of the arrival of the proletarian revolution and to the practical necessity of this revolution. \"\n  </strong>\n  (Stalin, on the basis of Leninism).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Russia and China, the former socialist countries that, with their emerging new markets, have given the imperialist system a respite, has become the main actors of the interimperialist rivalry with the Hegemonaks of the United States. This means that the contradictions have increased in scope and character as new and powerful players have been involved in the battle for redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with the invasion of the Russian imperialism of Ukraine took place against this backdrop. It is predictable that this trend will be reinforced and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, there are hemispheres and colonies that are subject to division war. The world's semi -colonies and oppressed people will continue to pay the prize for these wars until the imperialists declares direct war on each other.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With this will\n  <em>\n   The division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed land\n  </em>\n  - Mastically analyzed by Lenin - be further immersed. The third contradiction is tightened with the imperialist looting and the looting, and the semi -colonial and semi -fluttered rebellion in powerful national liberation wars and folk wars that shake the imperialist system.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Parallel to the process that imperialism undergoes the interimperialist contradictions, and the contradiction between imperialist countries and oppressed people and nations, all parts of the ruling system - especially the imperialist states - become more centralized, militarist and wars. fascist currents to bring society into a similar ideological format. This is done either by so -called right -wing extremists or under the cover of social democratic or liberal parties. Communists and the oppressed people in the world, facing a system that becomes more reactionary and aggressive day by day, need a Leninist party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power, as comrade Lenin outlined, to organize a strong opposition to this reaction . Only such a party, today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoistic party, can wipe an irreconcilable battle against the bourgeoisie.\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Lenin's great heritage, the Leninist perception of the party: the general staff of the proletariat\n </h4>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   And Revolut\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   sj\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   on is not\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   and you\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   rural\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   p\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   or as\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   to\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   write an essay or paint a picture or\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   to\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   Broders; it can't be\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   so\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   refined,\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   so\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   sti\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   l\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   lf\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   e\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   rig and gentle,\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   or\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   so\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   must\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   t\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   E -team, friend\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   n\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   corpse, polite, restrained and sternsin\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   n\n  </strong>\n  <strong>\n   And.

Throughout the hundred years since the death of Comrade Lenin, the imperialists have transformed their ruling structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police, secret services, etc. are equipped with capacities that are unsavigatable with the past. On the other hand, a significant proportion of those who call themselves \"communists\" or \"revolutionaries\" ignore this reality (although it seems to be theoretically accepted), and is far from positioning itself in accordance with it. By following an ideological and practical line for reconciliation, which locks the working class and the undisturbed masses firmly to the ruling system, they instead dampen the anger of the masses and act as waves. While the imperialists and the ruling structures for exploitation end up with increasingly violent appliances and institutions, it is necessary, as followers of comrades Lenin, to lead a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as \"revolutionary\" and \"communists \u00bbMoves further and further away from the reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. One of the most important tasks for performing Comrade Lenin justice during the centenary of his immortality is to start with comrade Lenin's unstoppable struggle against opportunism in the second international.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Comrade Lenin defined the new type of communist party as the \"proletariat's war organization\". This definition was necessitated by the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the Civil War that broke out with the October Revolution were the specific reasons why Comrade Lenin called the Communist Party \"The Proletariat's war organizion\". It is a necessity that the Communist Party, which will lead the liberation of the proletariat and the oppressed, has the hallmark of the mass, while the counter -revolution arms itself from head to toe with violence and violence and commit all of these cruel massacres against the working class and the oppressed people. A revolutionary war needs a fighting party to lead it. Only fools and unrelated revisionists who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Some people make fun of us to be supporters of \"the omnipotence of the war\". Yes, we are supporters of the omnipotent of the revolutionary war; It's good, not bad, it's Marxist. The Russian Communist Party's rifles created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. Experience from the class struggle in the imperialist era teaches us that it is only through the power of the rifle that the working class and the working masses can defeat the armed bourgeoisie and the armed landlords; In this sense, we can say that it is only with rifles that the whole world can be reshaped.\n  </strong>\n  (Mao Zedong)\n </p>\n <p>\n  At its stifle conference, the IKF defined the structure and reconstitution of the Communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party that Comrade Mao Zedong developed is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party as Comrade Lenin sketched out, who was enriched by Stalin, and is in the Marxist-Leninist-Maoistic ideology the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions that we are in, a communist party that is capable of standing against the increasing aggression of the imperialist reaction, and leading the proletariat and the world's oppressed people to liberation, must have the quality of a \"proletariat's war organization\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  An essential part of Lenin's heritage is the question of political power as the basic question for all revolutions. Lenin showed how\n  <strong>\n   \"The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without replacing this with a new one\"\n  </strong>\n  , and how\n  <strong>\n   \"Everything except power is an illusion\"\n  </strong>\n  . Under Lenin's personal leadership, the world's first socialist state and the dictatorship of the proletariat were established, and cemented the proletarian path to power and to retain it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After Lenin's death, it was his successor Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it further and made it the entire basis of the international communist movement. On the shoulders of the Great Lenin, chairman Mao managed to advance the proletarian world revolution to greater heights and further developed the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism, which today is Maoism-Leninism-Maoism, must be embraced, defended and used today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As IKF, we will continue to perform the tasks that the big Lenin put in front of us, and make good use of the legacy that Comrade Lenin has left to us.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Comrade Lenin, the International Proletariat and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism's great teacher, leader and guide our struggle for the proletarian world revolution, today, as he did yesterday!\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!\n  </strong>\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  <strong>\n   Live the proletarian internationalism!\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\n  International Communist Federation\n  <br/>\n  January 2024\n </p>\n</section>\n", "source": "https://tjen-folket.no/2024/03/02/uttalelse-fra-ikf-om-lenin/", "type": "article", "title": "Statement from IKF about Lenin", "description": "On the occasion that this year we mark 100 years since Comrade Lenin's passing has an international communist federation published a statement that we in TFM Here publish an unofficial Norwegian translation of.\u2026", "modified time": "2024-03-02T07:34:00+00:00", "author": ["Tjen Folket Media"], "categories": ["Uttalelser"]}
