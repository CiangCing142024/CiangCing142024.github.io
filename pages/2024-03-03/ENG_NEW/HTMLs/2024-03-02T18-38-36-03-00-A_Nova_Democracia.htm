  Illegal Jewish settlers set a new advanced settlement post on the lands of the village of Al-Lubban Ash-Sharqiya, south of Nablus, north of occupied West Bank, Anadoli news agency said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yacoub Awais, head of the Al-Lubban Ash-Sharqiya Council, would have told Anadolu that "a group of settlers established an advanced settlement post in the village lands."
 </p>
 <p>
  Awais explained that the advanced post is composed of six caravans, warning that it will represent a danger to the local population and the Palestinian territories, added Anadolu.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Settlement Advanced Post is located on a mountain overlooking a place where, on Thursday, a Palestinian man carried out a shooting operation in which two Israeli settlers were killed before being killed by the Israeli army.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the operation, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he required stronger action in West Bank.
 </p>
 <p>
  This "requires FDI to close roads, resume control posts and massively implement colonies as an appropriate Zionist response," said Smotrich, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Strong conviction
 </h4>
 <p>
  In turn, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the creation of the Advanced Settlement Post.
 </p>
 <p>
  "We vehemently condemn the continuous climb of Jewish colonial terrorists against citizens, their land, properties, trees, houses and sacred places," the ministry said in a statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ministry considered this climb "a flagrant challenge to resolutions of international legitimacy and international law, and a disdain for the understanding of the countries that reject the occupation."
 </p>
 <p>
  "We see that the Israeli government does not attach any importance to the international community and its decisions, and does not respect the positions and demands of the countries in this regard, provided that they do not translate into deterrent actions and sanctions," he added.
 </p>
 <p>
  Estimates indicate that about 700,000 Israeli settlers live in about 300 illegal colonies in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
 </p>
 <p>
  All Jewish settlements in occupied territories are considered illegal according to international law.
 </p>
 <p>
  Parallel to the War in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army intensified its raids in cities, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank and the illegal Jewish settlers intensified their attacks.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Genocide in Gaza
 </h4>
 <p>
  Expecting trial before the International Court of Justice by Genocide against Palestinians, Israel has been waggening a devastating war in Gaza since October 7.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the Ministry of Health of Gaza, 30,228 Palestinians were killed and 71,377 injured in the genocide promoted by Israel in Gaza, which began on October 7.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, at least 7,000 people are missing, presumably killed under the rubble of their homes throughout the Gaza Strip.
 </p>
 <p>
  Palestinian and international organizations say most of those dead and injured are women and children.
 </p>
 <p>
  Israeli aggression also resulted in the forced displacement of nearly two million people from all over the Gaza Strip, with the vast majority of forced displaced people to take refuge in the densely populated city of Rafah, in the south, near the border with Egypt - a fact that It has become the largest mass exodus of Palestinians since Nakba of 1948.
 </p>
 <p>
  Israel states that 1,200 soldiers and civilians were killed during the Al-AQSA flood operation on October 7. The Israeli press published reports suggesting that many Israelis were killed that day for "friendly fire."
