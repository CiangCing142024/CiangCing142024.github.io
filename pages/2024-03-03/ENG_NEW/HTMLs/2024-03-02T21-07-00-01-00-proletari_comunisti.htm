  The Italian Navy immediately began his own 
 "Operations" in the Red Sea by breaking down a drone that the Minister of War 
 Crosetto attributes to the Yemenites that the international imperialist bourgeoisie 
 Call Houthi.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Crosetto speaks of violation of international law 
 overturning the truth: they are all the imperialist countries present in the area, 
 from Italy (which does not respect article 11 of the Constitution), to the States 
 United, France, Germany ... who without having even officially declared the 
 War (which they have been doing for some time now, from Iraq to Libya to Syria ...) 
 they attack and bomb non -welcome countries as is the Yemen currently because they dare 
 Defending Palestine against the genocide put in place by Israeli Nazisionism.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Crosetto also tries to justify the attack by saying 
 who are there “to ensure the freedom of navigation and the security of 
 commercial routes ”, while the spokesperson of the Yemenita government had notified notes 
 who would have attacked only the ships who trade with the Nazisionists 
 Israelis ...
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  How credible the version of the Ministry can be credible 
 of the defense it is derived from the fact that the drone would have “characteristics 
 similar to those already used in previous attacks "but“ it was about 6 
 kilometers [!!!] from the Italian ship, in flight towards it ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal">
  To complete the irresponsible and warflower attitude 
 Tajani thought about representatives of the modern Italian fascist government 
 that like any fan he said: '' I send a hug to everything 
 The crew of Duilio "who replied" brilliantly " 
 At the attack. "Bravi our sailors," said Foreign Minister, 
 Antonio Tajani, to the microphones of 'tonight Italy' confirming the demolition of 
 A drone by the Duilio ship in the Red Sea "...
