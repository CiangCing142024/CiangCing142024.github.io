   The main countries involved in supplying arms and military goods to 
Israel are the US, Germany, Italy and the UK. This document outlines 
sites connected to production for the Israeli military in different 
countries and, where possible, identifies where military goods are 
transported from.

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  We aim to provide a resource for 
actions that target the production or transport of military goods, or 
disrupt the activity of Israel’s military suppliers, and also to link 
resources that can be used to take action in particular countries.
 </p>
 <p>
  ‍
 </p>
 <p>
  Our
 research identifies companies that produce some of the arms most 
fundamental to the Israeli military, including Lockheed Martin (prime 
contractor for the F35 fighter jet), Boeing (manufacturer for many of 
the guided weapons used by the Israeli military), BAE Systems (a leading
 supplier for the F35), Leonardo (part of the F35 coalition) and 
Raytheon (manufacturer of the Paveway guided bomb).
 </p>
 <p>
  ‍
 </p>
 <p>
  Action
 is possible in different forms – while we identify sites of direct 
production for the Israeli military, it is also possible to target 
multinational companies that produce for Israel even if military goods 
are made at another site. Likewise, it is possible to target companies 
involved in the transportation of military goods to Israel.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Arms 
production is highly international and many of the most traceable supply
 chains are for goods such as fighter jets made by international 
coalitions. These aircraft are central to the current war and 
bombardment of Gaza – Israel is using “
  <a href="https://theaviationist.com/2023/10/12/iaf-aircraft-war-with-hamas/">
   every combat aircraft at its disposal”
  </a>
  ,
 including F15s, F16s, F35s and AH-64 Apache helicopters. There are 408 
links in the supply chain for the F35, for example: see a

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Inevitably,
 supply chains are much more complex than this document can account for 
and many smaller companies are involved. If you use this document as a 
starting point, you may be able to identify more detailed supply chains 
to disrupt.

   almost $4bn in military aid annually, “including about $500mn for air 
and missile defences.” Israel also spends heavily on US weapons, having 
purchased roughly $53.5bn of military goods from the US over the past 
seven decades according to the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, 
including $6.5bn in the five years to 2022. Israel has made some of 
these purchases using military aid received from the US. For a list of

  <h3>
   Military Transport and Logistics from the US to Israel
  </h3>
  <p>
   While
 many finished military goods are transported by the military itself, 
either by military vessels or airlift, components and some goods are 
transported by sea on board normal container vessels. Ports are key 
nodes in the supply chain for arms.
  </p>
  <p>
   ‍
  </p>
  <p>
   The key actor in 
shipping from the US – and elsewhere in the world – to Israel is the ZIM
 shipping line. ZIM is the main provider of shipping services to Israel 
and one of the top ten largest shipping lines in the world. Previously 
controlled by the Israeli government, ZIM has been privatized and listed
 on the NY stock exchange over the last two decades. Despite this, it 
still retains close links to the Israeli state and is crucial to 
ensuring logistical support for the state and the IDF.
  </p>
  <p>
   ‍
  </p>
  <p>
   Most
 military components enter and exit the US via its east coast ports – 
primarily New York/Newark, Savannah, Charleston, and the Port of 
Virginia. These ports are typically unionized by the International 
Longshoremen’s Association, or ILA. This is because most military supply
 chains center on Europe and the US with many components produced in 
Europe and final assembly taking place in the US.
  </p>
  <p>
   ‍
  </p>
  <p>
   With 
access to US trade data, it is possible to see individual shipments via 
their “bills of lading”, the documents used by shipping lines to 
identify shipments, and track patterns of deliveries. In rare instances,
 this can include weapons shipping on civilian vessels. For example, on 
March 4, 2023 a shipment of “WARHEADS, ROCKET WITH BURSTING CHARGE” 
produced by Raytheon in Tucson, Arizona and worth $100,000, left the 
Port of Virginia headed for Haifa, Israel on the Zim Yokohama 
containership. Other Raytheon shipments have left on the same route in 
the following months. In most cases, trade data can identify the routes 
for components. For example, Dunlop regularly ships tires for the F35 
and other military aircraft from its factory in Birmingham, UK either 
via London to the Port of Virginia or via Liverpool to Charleston.
