We realise that those who \u201ckeep 8 March alive\u201d have a very blurred consciousness. This blurred consciousness has led them to call 8 March \u201cWomen\u2019s Day\u201d or \u201cWorking Women\u2019s Day\u201d. Apart from the possibility of using this name as a tactic to be \u201d inclusive \u201c, we will deal with the revisionist line that we see concretely; because the struggle against revisionism is in favour of our revolution and will help to find the right line. This struggle involves not only the destruction of the enemy, but also our own development. We must constantly struggle to seek, uncover, defend and overcome the truth so that the revolutionary line can win the victory. We must not forget for a moment that those who take responsibility for creating and spreading the revolutionary line are not free from regression and the problems that lead to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the revolutionary women\u2019s organisations, especially in the last 10 years, we can say that feminist attitudes, sometimes shy and sometimes bold, have gained importance. These attitudes, visible from declarations to slogans and banners, have \u201cnow\u201d gone beyond the level of a tendency, and a sexist standpoint has begun to replace the class standpoint. The scientific nature of this standpoint, which is legitimised by the term \u201cwomen\u2019s standpoint\u201d, is never discussed. The righteous rebellion of the oppressed woman is reduced to the level of a reproach that fits into the order. From the bourgeois woman\u2019s point of view, partnership is not perceived as a class problem. Since the ideological struggle against feminism is advised, this process has developed into support for the feminist movement, which follows it or does not follow it and gradually becomes similar to it.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In this process of development, in which we are also involved with sometimes strong and sometimes weak discussions, the revolutionary women\u2019s movement in Turkey has lost ideological and political power. While the women\u2019s movement is developing, while the oppression of women in every respect is being put on the agenda and problematised by a broad section of people, we are confronted with the reality that the revolutionary women\u2019s movement has lost power. Our \u201cminority position\u201d within the women\u2019s organisations and our inability to ensure unity within ourselves have paved the way for this; the concealment of our identity, our class attitude, which gives us strength, has made us immobile. When will we claim our blocked identity?\n </p>\n <p>\n  If a revolutionary woman has to hide her \u201crevolutionary\u201d identity on 25 November or 8 March, can we say that women are represented there, or can they really express themselves? It is inevitable to discuss this problematic existence of the revolutionary women\u2019s movement, which has become clear in recent times.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The demand that \u201cno organisation should have more political weight than a single person\u201d is worth evaluating in this respect. This demand, which also contains the warning to the revolutionary women\u2019s movement: \u201cMake yourselves invisible, you are frightening\u201d, points to the audacity of feminism. It is a kind of isolationist policy. What is behind this isolation, which is justified with the innocence of the \u201cprotection of the individual\u201d? Is this illogical demand, which denies and imposes the denial of organisation, not itself \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d? By placing the identity of \u201cwoman\u201d above all classes and identities, the impression is given that revolutionary women\u2019s organisations do not care about the mass of women \u2013 because we say that women\u2019s liberation lies in the revolution! Inherent in this demand is the understanding that the organised movement must not run ahead of the spontaneous movement of the masses. The organised movement, which would get in the way of individuals, is undesirable because it is \u201crestrictive\u201d, and it is assumed that the women\u2019s movement will be \u201cfree\u201d in this way. But is that really the case? Is the emancipation of women possible on an individual basis? What is the horizon and reality of a women\u2019s struggle without organisation and revolution? Even if organised behaviour and leadership by one person are inevitable even in the simplest movement, even if it is inevitable to target the power of the tyrant, can it be an innocent desire to have \u201cno more political weight than a single person\u201d? Whose desire can this desire, which pits the individual woman against the organised woman, be?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fact that a woman is progressive-revolutionary and organised results from certain characteristics. These \u201clabels\u201d are not empty titles, they contain certain practices and concrete forms. They are concretised through words, actions and behaviour. Therefore, a form of self-representation is inevitable. Among the masses, the progressive-revolutionary will definitely be at the forefront and lead the way. This is the case whether it is accepted or not. No other colour we wear can hide our redness. The fact that this demand comes in a \u201cstrong\u201d and clear form indicates a boldness, and we have no problem with that boldness. The boldness to speak your mind is a good thing. The problem is the lack of response to that boldness. At this point, the boldness of not defending one\u2019s identity is an important problem. Not daring to defend one\u2019s ideas and stance would be a political crime against any woman seeking her liberation. For this reason, we must continue to develop the unity of action of revolutionary women\u2019s organisations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    A STRANGE WAR\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The guilt of the thief will surely come to light; in this article we will deal with the landlord. While the women\u2019s organisations that call themselves revolutionary leave the question of women\u2019s emancipation to other issues, they seem to have jettisoned what they stand for. Many women\u2019s organisations openly accept the line of feminism. In any case, what we expect from these organisations is nothing more than the way they currently express themselves. The problem lies with those who claim not to be feminists: conformity leads to uniformity and ultimately rejection of the revolutionary line. The reason why we and some other women\u2019s organisations like ours are \u2018marginal\u2019 is because they are unable to \u2018become the same\u2019, not out of incompetence of course, but because of the revolutionary tradition on which they are based and the class attitude from which they feed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If we look at the declarations of the Democratic Women\u2019s Movement (DWL) and the right-wing liquidation group on 8 March, we come across the \u201cunbearable lightness\u201d of not even being able to call 8 March \u201cInternational Working Women\u2019s Day\u201d. We can judge this situation as \u201cconfusion\u201d or \u201ckeyboard hypocrisy\u201d, let\u2019s judge it as such and move on. In the statement of the DWL entitled \u201cWe are in revolt against war, poverty, massacre of women\u201d and the word \u201cwar\u201d in the title, we could not find any sentence in the content. With this approach, we see that 8 March is only being condensed into identity politics. We understand that the statement read out by comrade Barbara Anna Kistler on 8 March \u201992 has been erased from memory, let us remind you: \u201cContrary to what feminists say, the women\u2019s question is inseparable from the class question.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  The war question! We believe that the friends have misunderstood Clara Zetkin, whom they often mention. Clara Zetkin was directly against unjust wars, and for this reason she was absolutely anti-imperialist. The struggle of both the DFB and the right-wing liquidation group against \u201call wars\u201d is one of the outstanding features of this period. But it is still not understandable. There are two kinds of wars: Just wars and unjust wars. Can it be neglected that the revolutionary struggle in our country includes armed struggle from beginning to end, that it imposes war as an inevitability, that the limitation of unarmed struggle is a reality? Such neglect does not lead to an obscuring of the revolutionary character. \u201cThe armed struggle for revolution is valid from the beginning to the end, the armed struggle is indispensable in all struggles\u201d is written as a principle. The positions of those who declare that they still insist on this principle and consciously or unconsciously exclude war are extremely confusing or indicate confusion. If they are \u201cconscious\u201d opponents of war, they must admit that they are revisionists; if not, they must admit that they are apolitical. There are those who argue that almost everything has changed in this period and that past forms of struggle should be abandoned as \u201covercoming the old\u201d. We too argue that the old must be overcome and will inevitably be overcome; but the \u201cold\u201d cannot be overcome with years, it requires struggle, development and effort. The old forms over the years, but it does not always disappear over the years. It disintegrates, becomes unbearable, but it can continue to exist. Like feudalism, like capitalism\u2026 It is precisely for this reason that we argue that perseverance in principles is a guiding principle in the struggle against revisionism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bourgeois movements recognise war as \u201cmen\u2019s work\u201d. Unjust wars also serve to enforce, consolidate and maintain male domination. In unjust wars, women are massively attacked, enslaved, captured, emigrated, sold on slave markets, subjected to the worst tortures and raped. Women\u2019s resistance to war is revolutionary when its main target is unjust wars. Women do not have to be the trampled grass on which the elephants trample!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Women who take sides in just wars say that they develop and liberate themselves in war. G\u00fcl Kaya (Nergiz) says, \u201cWhen it comes to war, a field symbolised by men, our work becomes even more difficult,\u201d and she advises women to free themselves from the vines that entwine their feet. Gamzeg\u00fcl Kaya (Ekin) captures the reality where she says: \u201cMy reasons to fight are increasing day by day. For this reason, we will continue to participate in just wars against imperialist-unjust wars. We \u201cwant to fight wherever there is life\u201d. This approach, which restricts women to certain combat zones, is very dangerous. Women, who are part of humanity, must fight tirelessly in all areas for the liberation of humanity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   <strong>\n    UNITY FOR WHAT?\n   </strong>\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  We often see these comrades joining a bourgeois group, current or movement. We catch them insisting on associations based only on \u201cpower\u201d by talking about \u201cthe greatest possible unity\u201d. We know that a multitude of people without a goal of power is not power. You cannot be strong if you consider practices that are not aimed at power to be the \u201celixir of life\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the attempt to react to the process, the deviations to the right and the left show themselves in different forms. Action alliances have begun to lead to ideological alliances because the mechanisms of criticism are not sincere and the level itself is slippery!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without taking the unity of labouring women and the unity of women from the oppressed classes as a basis, revisionism will be the goal. On the other hand, the development of the unity of action of revolutionary women\u2019s organisations will open the way for a revolutionary approach to women\u2019s liberation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The vast majority of women who strive for liberation are oppressed, working women. For these women, liberation is possible through the struggle against the order, against the interests and interest relations of the ruling classes. The striving for the emancipation of women from the bourgeoisie and the striving for the emancipation of labouring women do not begin in the same place, do not continue in the same place and do not end in the same place. We must not forget that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle of women within the proletarian movement faced the struggle of women within the bourgeois movement, and it was only when the horizon of the proletarian movement was adopted that all forms of misogyny could be overcome. As a proletarian revolutionary, Jiang Qing rejected all traditional roles for women in her struggle against the aggression of Chinese revisionism. She did not live as \u201cMao\u2019s widow\u201d, but as an unreserved and active advocate of permanent revolution, who never gave up the struggle for revolution and loudly expressed her hatred of revisionism when she was put on trial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  No form of revisionism is innocent. The demand for disorganisation is not a call for protection and freedom for \u201cindividual women\u201d. On the contrary, it is about protecting traditional individualism, and it is fuelled entirely by the narrow interests of those who make this demand, who have a place in this order. Of course we will go along with them, of course we will listen to them. We will do this without giving up to develop our own line, without neglecting the responsibility to develop the right line, and without forgetting that the need for unity arises from the aim of making the great revolutionary war victorious.\n </p>\n</div>", "pdf_content": "", "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/03/29/womens-liberation-and-revisionism-no-colour-can-hide-the-red-weve-got/", "type": "article", "title": "Women\u2019s Liberation and Revisionism: No Colour Can Hide the Red We\u2019ve Got \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "8 March, International Working Women's Day, is now behind us.
