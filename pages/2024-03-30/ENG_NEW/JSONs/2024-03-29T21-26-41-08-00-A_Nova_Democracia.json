The decision was made 2 weeks after the national strike of technical-administrative servers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At a hybrid general meeting promoted by the UFPE Teachers Association (ADUFEPE), teachers approved of 81 votes in favor, with the purpose of salary recomposition, career restructuring and revocation of measures harmful to public education. In their speeches, the teachers favorable to the strike stressed the abuse of the current government Luiz Inacio with public education, the need to fight for the category, that is, not to reconcile with the cuts for education and other current policies currently currently. In the midst of debate, the concept of yellow union was surfaced by one of the teachers in favor of the strike, in a clear allusion to the union board, which remained until the inflexible ending in his position of not strike to \u201cdefend the Lula government \u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition to the indicative of strike, the creation of a local teacher mobilization command with the participation of entities representing technicians and students, a unified command between teachers and technicians to organize the planning of the strike, and the sending of representatives for meeting of the meeting National Association of Higher Education Teachers (Andes) to discuss the strike nationally, and a new assembly for the 17/04, with specific agenda of the strike.\n </p>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Yellow and undemocratic board\n </h3>\n <p>\n  By the time the election of representatives for the National Meeting of Andes came into the agenda, the conciliatory board, represented in the Assembly by President Maria Teresa Lopes Ypiranga and the second vice president Ricardo Oliveira da Silva, claimed that the Assembly had already passed the limit With a time established and, without discussion or debate, ended the virtual meeting, which still had more than 100 participants, effectively impossible for the assembly to be continued by the teachers revolted in the ADUFEPE auditorium. This typically undemocratic maneuver demonstrates the hit of democratic teachers who, in a speech, indirectly categorized the board of Yellow.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Throughout the Assembly, and even on the ADUFEPE website, the board of directors to Andes, a union that nationally stimulates the teachers' strike, due to an approximation of proifes, yellow union equipped by the Ministry of Education and rejects strike.
