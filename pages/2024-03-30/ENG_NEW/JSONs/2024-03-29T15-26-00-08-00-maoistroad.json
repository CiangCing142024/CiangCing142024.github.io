Likewise, it is possible to target companies \ninvolved in the transportation of military goods to Israel.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Arms \nproduction is highly international and many of the most traceable supply\n chains are for goods such as fighter jets made by international \ncoalitions.

Ports are key \nnodes in the supply chain for arms.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u200d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The key actor in \nshipping from the US \u2013 and elsewhere in the world \u2013 to Israel is the ZIM\n shipping line. ZIM is the main provider of shipping services to Israel \nand one of the top ten largest shipping lines in the world. Previously \ncontrolled by the Israeli government, ZIM has been privatized and listed\n on the NY stock exchange over the last two decades. Despite this, it \nstill retains close links to the Israeli state and is crucial to \nensuring logistical support for the state and the IDF.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u200d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Most\n military components enter and exit the US via its east coast ports \u2013 \nprimarily New York/Newark, Savannah, Charleston, and the Port of \nVirginia. These ports are typically unionized by the International \nLongshoremen\u2019s Association, or ILA. This is because most military supply\n chains center on Europe and the US with many components produced in \nEurope and final assembly taking place in the US.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u200d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   With \naccess to US trade data, it is possible to see individual shipments via \ntheir \u201cbills of lading\u201d, the documents used by shipping lines to \nidentify shipments, and track patterns of deliveries. In rare instances,\n this can include weapons shipping on civilian vessels. For example, on \nMarch 4, 2023 a shipment of \u201cWARHEADS, ROCKET WITH BURSTING CHARGE\u201d \nproduced by Raytheon in Tucson, Arizona and worth $100,000, left the \nPort of Virginia headed for Haifa, Israel on the Zim Yokohama \ncontainership. Other Raytheon shipments have left on the same route in \nthe following months. In most cases, trade data can identify the routes \nfor components. For example, Dunlop regularly ships tires for the F35 \nand other military aircraft from its factory in Birmingham, UK either \nvia London to the Port of Virginia or via Liverpool to Charleston.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <br/>\n   See section 3B in the\n   <a href=\"https://www.workersinpalestine.org/guidetoaction\">\n    Day of Action toolkit\n   </a>\n   for more information on this.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u200d\n  </p>\n </div>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u200d\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u200d\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "The main countries involved in supplying arms and military goods to  Israel are the US, Germany, Italy and the UK.
