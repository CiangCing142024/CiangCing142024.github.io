Wages shrink, accuracy beats red. Care and studies are transformed into expensive right for few. Popular rights and popular freedoms are called into question, and repressive forces act and terrorize daily.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   At the same time, the ND government, with the full support of the rest of the bourgeoisie (SYRIZA, PASOK, etc.), on behalf of the local capital, puts a back on the promotion of US military plans for Ukraine and the Middle East. It grants airports, allows for marine and aerial passes, has filled the country with US -NATO bases. This involves the people and the country in the dangerous and pro -war design of the murderers of the peoples!\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   The country's involvement in the US-EU-British intervention in the Red Sea is another serious step on an active front that can light fire throughout the Middle at any time. In this way, they support the US mantle in the region, Israel, and the bloodshed that still continues in Gaza.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   In the face of all these gloomy developments and the flame of war threatening the peoples, it is necessary to develop the anti-war-anti-imperialist struggle of the people and youth in our country. Employees and youth have no interest in involvement in imperialist competitions. On the contrary, we have every interest in fighting for the country unleashing the war, to stop any involvement and any facility in war plans, to leave bases, NATO and Americans.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   At a time when the capitalist-imperialist system expands and crushes any right and conquest, the people, the working class and the youth must put their stamp on developments. To chart their own path to their philanthropic plans. To rely on their own strengths and not to look for imperialists for patrons. To fight for peace, friendship and solidarity of peoples, against the nationalist poison that sheds imperialists and dependent bourgeoisie.\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   <br/>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n   \u2022 EXTRA-BASES-NATO-Americans!
