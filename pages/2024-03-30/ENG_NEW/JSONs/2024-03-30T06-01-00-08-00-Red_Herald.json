There is a lot to delve into if you want to prove the real motivation for the crime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is strange to hear from the current government\u2019s Minister of Justice, Ricardo Lewandowsky, that the Marielle case is closed, without a plausible motivation being presented. That the Braz\u00e3o family and the former head of the Civil Police, Rivaldo Barbosa, are involved, no one doubts. But it is stupid to think that Marielle was executed, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, in 2018, amid military intervention, for having voted against a bill that was approved for the benefit of the Rio mafias (badly called \u201cmilitias\u201d). The execution, carried out in a blatant far-right way, sending a clear message to the left and with the aim of destabilizing the political situation, has no identity with the motivation presented for the crime as a conclusion of the Federal Police investigation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Bolsonaro clan\u2019s relations with \u00c9lcio de Queiroz and Ronnie Lessa, driver and executor of the shooting on March 14, 2018, are known. On the day of Marielle\u2019s execution, \u00c9lcio de Queiroz was at Bolsonaro\u2019s residency in the apartment 58, whose owner is Jair Bolsonaro, and he appears in the guest book. Why did Luiz In\u00e1cio\u2019s minister ignore this fact, reported in 2019 by the residency doorman? Ronnie Lessa received a prosthesis from Bolsonaro when he lost his leg in an attack in 2009. Why does Lessa say he doesn\u2019t know Bolsonaro?\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   Perhaps leaving someone else to clean up the mess, Bolsonaro took refuge, for two days, in the Hungarian embassy, a country governed by one of the leaders of the global far right and a friend of the president, when the investigations into the Marielle case quickly moved to prisons. Bolsonaro is afraid of what? Although, it is true, in addition to this reason there is no shortage of others: there are accusations, investigations and proceedings for various crimes committed by him that could lead to him being arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It is certain that the Bolsonaro clan has some kind of relationship, to some degree, with the murder of Marielle Franco. She was not killed because she voted against a bill, nor would the Braz\u00e3o be so stupid as to attract all the attention to their criminal business, with a blatant political assassination,\n   <em>\n    just because\n   </em>\n   they confronted in a vote, in which not even the councilor\u2019s vote was decisive. The motivation presented by the Federal Police resembles a false trail that pointed to certain \u201cmilitias\u201d, as the Civil Police did in 2018, when they accused another militia member who was already in prison and serving a 25-year sentence \u2013 Orlando Oliveira Ara\u00fajo \u201cCuricica\u201d \u2013 as the person behind the attack on Marielle; at the time, Orlando rejected the accusation, for which there was no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p p=\"\">\n   <p>\n    The investigations, contrary to the unfortunate speech of Luiz In\u00e1cio\u2019s minister, are not completed \u2013 at least, not from a scientific and true point of view. There is a lot to delve into if you want to prove the real motivation for the crime. But, judging by the conduct of the minister and Luiz In\u00e1cio, irreducibly committed to the policy of appeasement with the soldiers, their purpose is to bury the matter.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Who ordered the murder of Marielle Franco?\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </p>\n</div>", "pdf_content": "", "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/03/29/and-weekly-editorial-the-unresolved-question-who-ordered-marielle-to-be-killed/", "type": "article", "title": "AND Weekly Editorial \u2013 The unresolved question: who ordered Marielle to be killed? \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "The investigations, contrary to the unfortunate speech of Luiz In\u00e1cio's minister, are not completed \u2013 at least, not from a scientific and true point of view.
