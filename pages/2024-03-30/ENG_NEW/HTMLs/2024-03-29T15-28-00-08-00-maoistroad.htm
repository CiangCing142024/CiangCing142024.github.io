    to Israel. This does not capture the full scale of UK military exports 
to Israel as many arms export licenses to Israel are “open” and there is
 no cap on the number of licensed exports or their value; and many 
licences are for the USA, for incorporation into bigger weapons systems 
for onward export to Israel. The most traceable exports from the UK to 
Israel are components for the F35 fighter jet and the F16 – both of 
which are used by the IOF in Gaza.

   <ul role="list">
    <li>
     <strong>
      Teledyne Defence and Space

 Shipley, Yorkshire. Teledyne manufacture components for air, land, sea 
and space radar equipment, including for the F35. Their defence and 
space subsidiary has one manufacturing plant in Shipley and has sales 
representatives (Ormic Components) based in Israel. Since 2018, its 
parent company Teledyne Technologies has applied for 134 export licenses
 from the UK to Israel.

 e2v (sales office and HQ Chelmsford and microwave electronics facility 
in Lincoln, UK). Originally a defence electronics company, e2v was sold 
to Teledyne in 2017. Although the firm has applied for 124 UK arms 
export licenses to Israel since 2008, this may have been in its previous
 incarnation as e2v and it is not clear which countries it uses to 
produce military technology at present.

     <strong>
      Elbit Systems

     ,
 an Israeli defence company with subsidiaries in the UK and US has had 
arms export licenses issued from the UK including for: military 
communications components; military communications equipment; military 
communications equipment software, body armour and military electronic 
equipment. The UK subsidiary of the firm has a new R&amp;D facility in 
Bristol. Although Elbit Systems exports from the UK to Israel, much of 
its production in the UK is focused around contracts with the British 
armed forces.

 and was worth €430m, of which the German government paid €115m as 
military aid. The ships are produced at
