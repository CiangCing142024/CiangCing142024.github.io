Due to the Party's accurate and absolute leadership, the people's army grew and grew, from small and weak, amid no cruel suppression and conjunction from the enemy's bud. The history and experience of the Party and the People's Army have proven that in the determined resistance and promotion of the armed struggle only the forces of the revolution will strengthen. For 55 years, the Party and the NPA successfully failed the cruel repression and destruction campaign launched by the exchanging puppet regime of US imperialism-from Kitlin-to-Bourge Oplan Cadena de Amor (OCDA) prototype of Oplan stability of the US-Marcos dictatorship SR.; Oplan Citizens and Oplan Citrus BITAG I and II of the US-Aquino regime I; Oplan Lambat BITAG III and Oplan development town of the US-Ramos regime; Oplan Makabayan and Oplan Balangai of the US-Estrada regime; Oplan Bantay Laya I and II of the US-Macapagal-Arroyo regime; Oplan Bayanihan of the US-Aquino II regime and the Oplan Peace and Joint Campaign Plan-the peace of the US-Duterte regime.

Filipinos, especially the oppressed and exploitative toiling to launch the offensive and achieve the initiative to justify their oppression and achieve redemption on unlucky poverty and cruelty as a result of unmatched chronic crisis ruling systems and imperialism. The internal and external factors have reached a level of maturity for the Filipino people to strive and view the large-scale-promotion of the national-democratic revolution. This is the great mission and contribution of the Philippine Revolution to the global proletarian revolution to overthrow and end the parasitic and decaying imperialism and to establish socialism, the first stage in the historic epoka of the establishment of communism.

Strictly hold the golden lessons from the brilliant revolutionary tradition of the people of the region in the last 500 years the Marxist-Leninist theory and Practice of the Philippines. Not only do we benefit from the achievements that have been achieved in other countries to overcome our own revolution, but we also hope to add our own success to others' success and to provide some benefits that contribute to the promotion of Marxism-Leninism and the global proletarian revolution , for the end of mankind to be free from the plague of imperialism and entered the time of communism. In the current phase of the Philippine Revolution, we are launching a people's war, a revolutionary war, as it is the only way to end the armed oppression of the people made by the reactionary instrument of the big comprador-landlord-landlord2. In accordance with this spirit taught by the Great Chairman Amado Guererro, if the talks are the best of contributing to the Southwest Region's interest in promoting and successful of the People's War in the Philippines, there is nothing more important than the principles' The lesson we have learned based on the conditions of the region and our own revolutionary experience. We have the highest appreciation for the principles and lessons that the people's lives and blood in the region have. We do this, not in a narrow localist perspective but to fulfill our basic duty to apply the universal reality of MLM and the basic principles of the CPP to the TK region's concrete practice and circumstances to contribute to our national growth, progress and success. In the past seven years of life and death struggle, we have successfully disappointed US imperialism and its puppet state to end the democratic people's revolution promoted by the Party, NPA and revolutionary citizens. Despite serious injuries and withdrawal in some parts, the flag of revolution in the country and the TK region is firmly stood and stood firmly. The Party and the NPA should be celebrated and proud of the Party and the Political Goals of the DRB's political purposes regardless of the replacement of sacrifice and sacrifice. This is because the NPA Party holds the proper basic principles that political power comes from the end of the gun and without the army, there is no citizen. The foundation of the revolutionary tradition of the Filipino people and the people of TK is very deep, strong and unstoppable. The current democratic revolution of the people is continuing for more than five centuries of the people's brave fight against colonialism and neocolonialism. It led the incomparable spirit of the people to armed forces against a series of foreign conquerors and the local collaborators of the ruling classes and traitors who had interacted with conquerors to divide and rule the Filipino people. The new DRB's new type has been historic and advanced in the last 55 years. This is due to stable leadership of the CPP and the light of the universal reality of MLM. We should be tirelessly studying the knowledge of applying MLM to the concrete practice of the revolution If the discussion is to advance and succeed our own people's war, nothing more important than the principles and lessons learned We are based on the conditions in the Philippines and our own revolutionary experience. In this regard, we have the highest appreciation for the principles and lessons that our own people are taxed. 1 Amado Guererro, particularly characteristic of the People's War 2 Ibid <br><br> 4 March 29 20244 Filipino Guides against the Spanish colonialism to be hit by the 1896 revolution of the Katipunan under the leadership of Gat Andres Bonifacio. The 1896 revolution against Spain colonialism is recorded as the first crack of bourgeois-democratic revolution in Asia. It was initiated by 1521, by the successful defeat of Lapu-Lapu in the Spanish conquest of Ferdinand Magellan's leadership. Since then, the epic of the brilliant revolutionary armed struggle of the Filipino people has never been interrupted so that the people can achieve national independence, democracy and socialism. The revolutionary tradition of the people of the Southwest was set on the fire of less than 400 years of struggle against Spanish colonialism (1521- 1898). However, because of the separate and spontaneous stripes, it has repeatedly fails and is repeatedly suppressed by Spanish colonialism using the divide and reign tactics and the cross and sword. This separated expression of our ancestors from various parts of the country served as a starting preparation until the national consciousness led to the eruption of the Rebellion of 1896 led by Gat Andres Bonifacio and the Most High Respondent of the Children of the People (Katipunan). This armed struggle has succeeded to end the 300 -year rule of Spanish colonialism and establish the Philippines. However, due to the leadership of the illustrated leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo to seize the leadership of the revolution, it will fail to fight the occupation of US imperialism and surrender the winner of the 1896 revolution to the new conqueror. The new imperialist power captures the freedom of the Filipino people and is bound to its colonial and neocolonial rule that has continued for 126 years. Among the more than 300 citizen colonialism of the Spanish colonialism was the recorded two Chinese uprisings in 1603 and 1639-1640 identified Sangley Rebellion I and II that took place in Rizal, Laguna and Cavite, the 1740 peasant uprising In Cavite, Laguna Batangas and Bulacan, Matienza's leading to Lian and the Filipino, led by us by the Great Jose Maria Sison-Amaado Guererro, chairman of the CPP (MLM) and the greatest leaders and heroes of the Philippine Revolution over the last century . These are unique to the monumental papers he wrote as follows: Philippine society and revolution, correct mistakes and rebuild the party, specifically the character of our people's war, our strict duties, no substantial change in Philippine society , Re -strengthen our basic principles and correct mistakes, stand up for socialism against modern revisionism and MLM: Guide of the Philippine Revolution. These papers have successfully applied the universal reality of MLM to the concrete status and practice of the Philippine Revolution. These papers are clearly guided by the immediate and long -term directions and duties of the Philippine Revolution. As a result, the Philippine Revolution has moved forward without a twist and continues to wave the torch of the people's long -standing people in the critical time the socialist camp has suffered a strategic defeat because of the modern revisionist treachery and capitalist restoration - first to the Soviet Union, from 1953 and , Second, in China from 1978. The people are deeply understood, especially by the Filipino revolutionaries that regardless of significant economic, political, political, culture and all-sided development of Philippine society, it has been built by the armed struggle and the revolutionary resistance of our ancestors who were led by the eternal heroism, sweat, life and blood of the current generation of revolutionaries. The people also deeply understand that whenever they take the weapon or the brief to hold on to it, the conquering foreign forces and their savage local ruling classes reign Curious to suppress armed resistance and seize or deny any success the people have achieved. We should be proud of and handle the lessons in the unstable record of over 300 armed uprisings launched by <br><br> March 29, 20245 In the provinces of Laguna, Cavite, Batangas and Tayabas. The 13 martyrs of Katipunero who were killed in Cabite were now known as the "Los Trece Martires de Cavite". In fact, the provinces of Cavite, Batangas and Laguna declared a full-time support of the revolution. The South is also the base of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, who was once leading the faculty of the Katipunan. In the wake of Aguinaldo's illustrators who pushed the seizure of the Katipunan leadership that led to the murder of brothers Andres and Procopio Bonifacio on May 10, 1897. However, apart from Aguinaldo's Capitical town, other provinces In the South, Andres Bonifacio continued to recognize the leadership of Andres Bonifacio, and they were forced to go to Aguinaldo when it was clear that Bonifacio was gone. Despite Aguinaldo's surrender to the Spaniards and the Hong Kong in exchange for money, the armed actions of the Katipuneras continued under the leadership of General Malvar. General Malvar followed Aguinaldo's command line, so he was recognized as the new president and commander-in-chief of the Katipunan after Aguinaldo surrendered. The war led by Malvar is a guerrilla war that possesses the greatness of a people's war - the concealment and support of the masses, which the American says they seem to oppose the entire Filipino masses in Batangas and Laguna. By June 1898, almost the whole of Luzon was in the hands of the Katipuneras. In August, General Malvar's forces released Tayabas (Quezon), while the Spanish forces surrendered to the forces of General Paciano Rizal in Santa Cruz, Laguna. The revolution and success of the revolution on the island of Mindoro also featured the leadership of Juan Naguit, Gasic, Colonel Alfonso Panopio who ended the Spanish rule in Mindoro after 328 years. After the first American murder of Filipinos in San Juan on February 2, 1899, the bloody conquest of Americans with a total of 70,000 forces began. General Bell's military campaign in Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Tayabas Nasugbu, Batangas, identified the brutality of the military campaign. Andres Novales in Cavite in 1823, the first religious uprising of Apolonio dela Cruz aka Hermano Pule in Tayabas (Quezon), Laguna and Batangas in 1840-1841 and the next Samaniego revolt of the Tayabas Regiment and the resistance of colorums, the Sergeant La Madrid in 1872, the fight against Filipino workers at the Cavite Pier was blamed on three priests Gomez, Burgos and Zamora and the fight against robbers or ladrones in 1880 in Mindoro under the leadership of Captain Valeriano Gasic y Ramos. Filipinos have launched armed resistance due to seizure of the land of the peasant masses, forced labor through the implemented colonialist polo system, discrimination against Filipino priests and soldiers, raising brown, murder and whatever -What is the cruelty carried out by the Spanish colonialists. When the Katipunan was built and the 1896 revolution broke out, the Southwes' people played an active role. In addition to the Katipunan base of the province of Rizal, thousands of Katipuneras came from <br><br>  6 Kalatat 29 March 2024 The suspicions that Americans launched against them failed and failed. The support they received from the masses and even some illustrators were strong. Sakay has long been the base of the island of the Laguna de Bay and Mount San Cristobal in Dolores Quezon. Here the Manifesto of the Republic of the Embroidery was written. It is also believed to be "sworn" that they will not cut their hair until the foreign Kano is not expelled. Sakay himself led an uprising in Barangay Talaga of the said island. The San Mateo of Rizal was one of the battles of the battle between the revolutionaries under Sakay's leadership and the US troops. By January 31, 1905, the Americans decided to suspend the writ of habeas corpus in Cavite and Batangas due to the intensity of the attack by the Filipino guerrillas. Americans used 3,000 soldiers to defeat Sakay's forces and achieved it in 1905. At the same time Gen.'s efforts Artemio Ricarte called Ricarte's movement. Ricarte refuses to conspire with the Americans and has been deported twice overseas. When he returned in December 1903, he succeeded in contacting several colonels and low-rank officials with the revolutionary army, and launched some coordinated but small offensive. At the same time, the religious rebellion led by Ruperto Rios took place in Tayabas (now Quezon) in 1902- 1903. From 1906-40, amid the consolidation of the EU imperialist power and his local puppies, still continuing the armed armed actions of the people. In addition, the workers' struggle, even the peasant masses, spread to the national level. Among the workers, the Congress Obrero de Filipinas was promoted in 1913, Federacion del Trabajo in 1917, Legionares Del Trabajo in 1919, Philippine Children's Katipunan in 1929. Among the peasants the farmers' Union became famous 1917, Sweat in 1919, a collection of workers and peasants in the Philippines in 1922, Philippine Farmers' Celebration of the Farmers in 1928 and where General Malvar's forces are strong. Hamletting and Reconcentrado were there where the whole masses were gathered in the poblacions of towns such as Tanauan, the plant was burned, the pets were killed and the wells pointed out. In each of Malvar's guerrilla attack they kill a mass leader in return. It was a big part that pushed Malvar to a ceasefire (but he never swore to the American flag). According to Census data, the Batangas population dropped to a third from the last Spanish census and the first American census, or about 100,000 people. Filipinos, including the people of the region, bravely fought. The US first had to implement the heinous henism against the Filipinos before they could resist the armed resistance of 5 million citizens. They killed 600,000 Filipinos. By 1902, there was no one to be seen in the Batangas countryside. During the Philippine-American war, Mindoro played an important role-first, as an economic cow supply base for revolutionaries and second, as a strategic attraction. Only in August 1900 did the Americans determine the secret to bringing cattle and logistics to Mainland Luzon. History records the cruelty of American soldiers under the leadership of Major R. K. Evans of the 13th Infantry Command on the island of Mindoro. He has implemented disgusting initiatives such as: blocking food supply lines (affected by non -combatants); Hamlet in the population occupying the entire districts and out of Hamlet it authorized American troops to kill anyone and destroy anything (burning houses, killing animals, destroying yields and poisoning in water drink). As a result, there was a cholera epidemic throughout the population. Revolutionary leaders Macario Sakay, Julian Montalan and Cornelius Felizardo established the so -called Republic of Aldugan in May 1902. Through coordinated offensives, the forces of the forces seized many weapons <br><br> March 29, 20247 It was attempted to arrest after the strike at the La Minerva Cigar Factory. He based in Longos, Laguna and joined the force of Capt. Nicolas Encallado is a 60-year-old veteran of the revolution. They became Laguna and Tayabas. Asedillo understood the value of mass support. He became famous as the agitator and the encouragement of the masses to support the revolution. Up to 95% of Sampaloc residents, Tayabas is a member of their Building SamaPis Society. Asedillo's forces also launched operations of confiscation of landlords and massacres with abusive officials, soldiers and informants. It is also a popular anti-US movement, led by opportunist Benigno Ramos. He established the perfect newspaper that became a popular medium of objections to the reign of foreign and local ruling classes. Its readers became the summary of the Sacdivical Organization that reached 68,000-200,000 membership. They have won some positions in the puppet state in the 1934 election due to the bringing of farming programs including the departure of all taxes, confiscation of the large landlords of landlords and distributing it to farmers , and providing government service support in agriculture. Despite Ramos' opportunism and the suppression of the colonial state, other leaders and masses of the Sakddalist Movement continued in their actions in the form of the boycott of the plebiscite for Commonwealth Constitution. In response to the repression, the Sacredists planned an armed rebellion. The invasion of 150 armed Sakdalists in the municipality of San Ildefonso, Bulacan, They dropped the American and Filipino flag and replaced the Sacdress flag. After that, the Tanza and Bgy. Caridad of Cavite, Cabuyao and Santa Rosa of Laguna, and other towns have also launched similar action. In total, up to 60,000 farmers of Sacdress participated in the rebellion. National Unity of the Farmers in 1930. These organizations have been the medium for the authors and ideas of Marxist ideas in our country. Workers' union leaders have a line of relationships with revolutionary parties overseas especially at the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The popular worker leader at this time was Crisanto Evangelista who had struggled to spread Marxism-Leninism in the country. He became the Chairman of the CPP established on November 7, 1930, on the thirteenth anniversary of the success of the October Revolution (1917) and the establishment of the first socialist country in the world. From 1925 to 1930, workers' strikes exploded in various parts of the country, including the Central Central to Laguna (Canlubang). Almost at the same time, the armed action of the remains of the religious group (Colorum) in Tayabas. In 1930, members of the Central Central Committee Patricio Dionisio established the fortress, a secret movement against the Americans who had active members in Laguna and Kabite. Also featured in TK history is the armed uprising led by Teodoro Asedillo, also a member of the old CPP. He was hanging out <br><br>  8 March 29 2024 of successful offensives against fascist forces and punish the traitors. The problems of the Filipino guerrillas in Mindoro faced problems from the mid -1942 of the epic organization and coordination, the shortage of logistics and modern weapons, and the internal ribbons between various guerrilla groups. Due to the mistake of the Lava leadership, the US imperialism was not resisted when they returned to the Philippines at the time of the Japanese invaders and Filipino forces. On the contrary, they were accepted despite their massacre in the Hukbalahap squadrons. The level of the regional revolutionary strength of the region's citizens under the leadership of the old-fashioned CPP was greatly weakened when the Lava-Taruc leadership decided to surrender to the American imperialist, promote "democratic peace" and participated in the bourgeois and reactionary elections in 1946 by the Democratic Alliance. This betrayal and opurtunism have resulted in the massacre of American troops in squadron 77 in Masiko, Laguna's queue. When the winning candidates of the Democratic Alliance were ousted in Congress, including Lava and Taruc, they again called for the armed struggle in the first room of 1947. The Hukbalahap was resurrected by the New People's Name Army (HMB) on March 29, 1947. Because the regional farmers in Quezon, Laguna, Batangas and Rizal are deeply rooted in the region, the spirit of the armed resistance is deep, the people responded and the HMB and the CPP influenced the TK in the following years. HMB's SONAs and guerrillas and guerrillas are further expanded. Many have been recruited at HMB and have built large squadron formations in Laguna, Quezon and Batangas. The region also became a standpoint for expanding Bikol. One of the main bases of Politburo out that Jesus Lava led Mount Sierra Madre, especially the Quezon-Laguna and Quezon-Bulacan Bulacan Lord. During the adventurist during the Japanese militarist occupation, the citizen of the region bravely participated in the Japanese liberation movement. Many citizens of Laguna, Rizal, Batangas and Quezon joined the Hukbalahap (People's Army Against the Japanese) under the leadership of the old combined party. The mountainous part of the aforementioned provinces has become a widespread maneuver and basis of the Hukbalahap. The people of the region vigorously supported the Hukbalahap until the Japanese militarist was eventually evicted. Throughout this time the Hukes and the CPP organized the people of the region to unite and combine the Japanese militarists together. It has also been a great opportunity for the Huk and the CPP to expand and build the guerrillas and guerrillas. One mayor and permanent They are based on the Sierra Madre mountains sewing the provinces of Quezon, Laguna and Rizal. In fact, the Sierra Madre of Sierra Madre became the economic and farm of the Hukbalahap. They have launched an agrarian revolution in the ownership of large landlords who have traced and interviewed the Japanese. They have also expanded the mountains of Banahaw and the Batangas mountains to the Cavite border. Laguna, in turn, became the main base. On the eve of Japanese evacuation in 1945, the Huk and CPP in Laguna had a provisional revolutionary government. Those who have not had the opportunity to join the Hukbalahap have become an active member of guerrillas such as Hunters, ROTC and marking guerillas. In the Rizal mountains the marking Guerillas is basic. It was led by Marcos Agustin from Eat, Rizal. Mount San Ysiro in Antipolo was one of the theater theater of the battle between the guerrillas and militarists. Command and Flow are strict in the HUK compared to the US -controlled USAFFE forces. In Mindoro led by Capt. Esteban Beloncio is the forces that retreat to the mountains to continue the fight as guerrillas. They launched <br><br> March 29 20249 The 55-year history of the NPA is an epic of sincere service and defense of the oppressed people and exploited. By being aware of the dedicated interests of one's own kind, the interest of the country for freedom and democracy and the faithfulness of the CPP's leadership comes the NPA's unlucky courage and courage to face the greatest poverty and trial. This is the secret of the NPA's unrest in front of the superior opponent. The decision to fight and win - this is the fountain of the people's army superiority - the most decisive factor in achieving the success of the Lava and Taruc's military, HMB reefs such as the raids in the municipality of Sta. Cruz and San Pablo of Laguna, Gayondin took place in the Municipality of Lukban in Quezon. If the people have been a witness and a direct participant in the development of the armed struggle from 1947 to the years that followed, they would also be participating and witnessing how the military adventurists and the Lava and Taruc's conflict were destroyed. II. The magnificent and brilliant history and tradition of the New People's Army at TK began with almost a BHB in the South. The efforts of the first NPA units to open the region of the fire have passed through the baptism of the fire. When we launched the guerrilla warfare in TK, we began with a huge disadvantage and huge limitations. But because we have high spirit and very rare determination, we have not discouraged in the face of the apparently absolute superiority of its reaction and armed forces. From almost a Kusing, the Party struggled to start the opening of guerrilla zones in various parts of the region from cadres and activists in the masses in the city, to the veterans of the first bedroom and new siblings revolutionary during the Fascist's ruling of the US-Marcos regime. With the Guide to the general line of the Party in the People's Democratic Revolution, the cadres and activists are driving to live in the country-to-dot masses and encourage the peasant masses in the people's democratic revolution through patient work in provocative, organizing and mobilizing the antifruit and antipasist mass movements linked to anti-imperialism. The people in the countryside welcomed the party line and in the intricate and unsteady roads, we built guerrilla zones after repeated processes of violent counter-revolution and re-recover from temporary injuries and failure. The great chapters of the revolutionary struggle of the peasant masses in the region are filled with revolutionary heroism. And with each end of a chapter and opening a new one, the heroic New People's Army in the Absolute leadership of the Communist Party is the center of every significant break of the people's struggle for national democracy. Our people's army is bravely dominated by irresistible difficulties and obstacles in the early times of the seed of guerrilla warfare in the region. Despite the consecutive failure of the first attempts to open a guerrilla zone in San Pablo, Laguna in 1969-70, Quezon Banahaw part in 1972 and 1973, West Batangas in 1973, Oriental Mindoro in 1973 and 1974, and withdrawal to preserve seed units in Upland Cavite and Eastern Batangas in 1974, the people's army has successfully expanded and rooted in the peasant masses in two coherent places -First, at the Quezon-Bikol border and second to the Sierra Madre border of Laguna and Quezon before the latter finally destroyed in 1975 due to false <br><br> 10 March 29 2024 The construction of artificial bases and other left mistakes that have expanded difficulties when the enemy launched a large raid and repression. However, due to promoting the proper policy of the then regional committee in Southern Luzon (KRTL) to gather the remaining forces and to strive in the central district, guerrilla warfare on the Quezon-Bikol border has continued to develop and intensify and intensify. single left in those who have tried to build this season. The Party successfully formed a relatively massive mass base until 1977 preserved despite the damage caused by Apolinario's (Rey Ababag's) facultyism in the last division of 1976 to mid -1977. Earlier, the regional committee successfully overlooked the region in the region. Southern Luzon The most critical periods of launching and establishing an armed struggle in the region due to subtle injuries to the regional leadership in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1977. In the early 1970s, the enemy arrested Nilo Tayag , the general secretary of the Central Committee and stood secretary of the KRTL while opening the guerrilla zone in San Pablo, Laguna. From 1973-74, a series of injuries struck the Party Committee on the sub-regic committee of TK and BK as a result of Benjamin Gapud's betrayal, a secretary of Nilo Tayag. The treacherous Gapud, Gerardo Espinas and Butch Bautista were responsible for the series of rear rear series in 1973 and 1974 that was almost destroyed by the South Luzon Party organization. Before the party and movement in TK have recovered, a series of damage hit the Courage Committee in the Upper Sierra Madre, Laguna and Quezon's upper Sierra Madre border with the massacre of Lorena Barros the Secretary of the Field Committee. This was followed by a widespread fire in 1977 which dramatically damaged the special committee organization on TK's white blast. Only during the July-August, 17 cadres of the region were arrested and to date remains. Among the well-known names lost at this time were companion Rizalina Ilagan, Cristina Catalla, Bong Sison, Samuel Ting, Ver Silva, Jessica Sales, Gerry Faustino, Leticia Pascual-Ladlad, Emmanuel Salvacruz, Salvador Panganiban and Erwin dela Torre. Despite these injuries, from 1979, the Quezon-Bikol border has continued to advance and have been the mother of established zones and guerrillas in various parts of the region in the next few years. Cadres and organizers from this have been investing in opening and expanding the Bondoc Peninsula and South Quezon in 1978 as well as the nearly operating in 1979 in three pile areas in Quezon and Batangas (Quezon Banahaw part, Quezon and Batangas border, and Eastern Batangas) and in Mindoro in 1980 and 1982. Meanwhile, the Party organization in Laguna has a separate effort to open for guerrilla warfare the Balisan of the Banahaw and the crowded plants attached to the Sierra Madre and the so -called Upper Sierra Madre attached to in Quezon from activists and students and workers who participated in the armed struggle. In all of these efforts, the guerrilla field of the Quezon and Bikol border played an important role in contributing important resources, personnel and exercises for developing guerrillas. The end of the sixties and the opening of the early years of the eighties has signaled the rapid growth of the armed struggle in the Southwest Region. This is further accelerated by the intense economic and political crisis of the Marcos dictatorship that has eased the various forms of people's resistance to the countryside and urban and broke the terror of fascist gloom. Due to desperation, the dying fascist dictatorship of a grand military campaign launched by the editor of its chief generals Fabian Ver and Fidel Ramos and then the minister of defense Juan Ponce Enrile - Oplan Cadena de Amor - designed for a prototype of the more grand national counter-insurgency program called Oplan Stability. Dreamed of the dictatorship of the guerrilla field At the border of Quezon- Bikol and Bondoc Peninsula-South Quezon at <br><br> March 29, 202411 The wrong line of the fast track-slow track insurrection, three major machinery and adelanted regularization and after the Siphayo and failure Due to this false line, Laurenaria led the Operation Missing Link (OPML)-a bloody pursuit of those The enemy's suspected impilance is suspected to be in the party based on fragile evidence, suspicion and suspicion- to blame the blame on the failures of the wrong line in the horror of the fears that surrounded the party of enemy infiltrators. Without the decisive intervention of the KTKS and Ka Armando Teng's assistance, it became secretary of the Party Regional Committee from 1983-85 and 1989-2000, more serious and longer the injuries that could be caused by the destructive-to-own anti-own anti-own campaign - Impartration of OPML capurals. The prevailing party line that the second great Great Correction Movement (IDKP) promotes and denies the wrong line of adelant regularization and city insurexism and has paved the way for steady recovery and re -advancement of activities that have been destroyed by the wrong line. In promoting and reinstating the basic principles of the Party and Revolution, the entire revolutionary movement in the Southern Region has continued to recover from injuries, re-strengthening and stepping on major progress in the late 1990s. This victory was carefully guilty by Ka Armando Teng, the strong pillar of IDKP in the region, to the last fiber of his life on November 7, 2000. In 1997, the party lost the success of the IDKP throughout the region. The revolutionary movement was placed on a solid foundation and almost all of the work advanced. During the approximately a decade of IDKP, the region has reached the top of the justification. The Party, the People's Army and the Revolutionary Citizen are brave enough to concentrate on the AFP's nine (9) battalions. The people's army bravely failed this grandchild. History has proven that the Oplan Cadena de Amor and the Oplan stability implemented by the Marcos dictatorship throughout the town the last desperate step of a in-the-barking regime. The rapid bribery of the ruling system's crisis motivated Marcos to produce a political misconduct when he killed his avid political rivals Benigno Aquino Jr. The crisis created by the Association of Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. In 1983 and - on the longer scale - the cumulative Pattical of the NPA's tactical offensives and sustainable mass protests throughout coffin of the hated dictator. In the historic first EDSA of 1986, the popular uprising Cum Military Cum has dropped Marcos. And subsequently, the revolution of the revolution throughout the archipelago was cleared. But the rapid advance and the rise of the revolutionary forces in the countryside and urban areas were disrupted by the dominance of the insurgency and the putty line of the rapid victory throughout the country. From 1986 to 1988, subsequently implemented by the regional party center led by treacherous Miel Laurenaria <br><br>  12 March 29 2024But, all of these hardships are overpowered by the Party and the NPA. Despite concentrating nine (9) AFP battalions in Mindoro and releasing the worst attack on the mass of the revolution and army, the enemy was unable to crush the NPA in a long -term campaign that reached more than five (5) years . The same has been approximately the pattern of other NPA guerrillas in various parts of the South-the NPA continues to preserve the strength, overwhelm the difficulties and regenerate amidst the disrepair. At the time of the US-Arroyo regime, the Arroyo-Angelo Reyes compound overcame the anti-terrorism of the archipelago. This is the local version of the war against terrorism and war -bound war by George W. Bush worldwide. Imperialists have interacted the anti-terrorism hysteria to attack and violently suppress the legitimate movements of the people for self-determination. US and the local puppet imperialism and the local puppet are not only the fair goal for the self -determination of the revolutionary movement but also the legitimate opposition from the citizens against abuse and abuse of their rights and livelihoods. The US has no shame to dismiss international conventions and protocols that rely on internal battles and civil war in the civilized world. It promotes a dirty war that has no observed or recognized laws and rules of war but a bloody pursuit and fierce operation and destination that does not consider the difference between combatant and non-combatant in war, children, women and adults as well as of hors de combat-a retreating in the state of barbarian war. In the South, the list of rape, cruel and tortured, evacuated and evacuated, and murdered children, adults, women and unlucky civilians simply because of the simple suspicion of the revolutionary movement, relative and relatives of revolutionaries or righteous critics of the regime's corrupt operation. Witness also every dark plan to destroy the pillar of the revolutionary political power it built in the countryside. The heroism and energy of the revolutionaries poured out to disappoint the fascist terror that every ruling puppet that had been installed in Malacañang was unstoppable. Due to the stable advocacy of the line of widespread and intensified guerrilla warfare with the fulfillment of the duties of the construction of the base and agrarian revolution, the revolutionary movement in the region has continued to reap successes in the people's democratic revolution. So by the end of 2003, the number of recorded guerrilla fields in the region reached more than three (3) times in 1992. It covered 83% of the congressional district in the 10 regional provinces that could cover zones and guerrillas. It equates to 60% of the total number of towns and cities compared to the 1992 scope of 41% and in 1994 only 37%. It also equates to 27% of more than five thousand of total villages in the region compared to 19% in 1992 and 10% in 1994. The puppet regime is concerned about this major advances in our region, something to concentrate on TK's intense attacks of mercenary AFP and PNP. It was made laboratory of harsh procedures, tactics and psy-ops of anti-insurgency operations of the AFP's special forces. In 1998, Oplan Makabayan was a priority to target the South. In the years that followed the Solcom and AFP's national priority concern for the region and specifically the island of Mindoro of their anti-insurgency offensive in the Oplan Balangai framework. From the appointment of 11 battalions for anti-insurgency in 1998, it has doubled and reached approximately 28 battalions by the end of 2002. Our guerrillas are assigned a variety of AFP and PNP task forces with a PNP with a Large Bag-as of Special AFP units such as Special Forces, Scout Rangers and Recon Battalion and uses innovative equipment for electronic intelligence and surbeylans such as the UAV (unmanned aircraft vehicle) as well as equipment for the equipment Evening operations of special anti-geillary units. <br><br> 29 March 202413 Kalatas Region on long list of cruel methods of murder such as beheading the victims and undergoing harsh torture before killing, the mutilation of corpses and a variety Only can. This is a picture of the usual mercenary troops that launch harsh anti-insurgency operations. The total growth of the revolutionary forces in the Southern Ages failed to be fully disclosed by the cruel Oplan Bantay-Laya I and II (OBL) and Oplan Bayanihan and its associated large-scale military and police troops deployments in the zones and guerrilla fields. All they have done is slow down the advancements of some parts of the task and temporarily attach or harm some parts. The regime failed to deepen the continuous support of the revolutionary movement and the people's army even in the lowest conditions and terors it sow at the basic level. This can be generally measured by the durability of the foundation created by the IDKP for the Party and the revolutionary forces. The experience of Mindoro, such as previous experiences in Laguna and the following Batangas and Rizal, has been exposed to us at Obl I and Obl II and the SQBP during Oplan Bayanihan, how the enemy implements the block house - first, in a relatively confined scope (a large guerrilla field), and in those Next, in a broader and ambitious plan (coincides with the ruin of guerrilla fields in more than one province). At the time of the Torical US-Duterte regime, the revolutionary movement in the Southern Region again faced the struggle with the enemy when it was placed As one of the first range of national priorities of destruction based on the targets of the joint campaign plan campaign- peace from 2019 to 2022. Accordingly, the region has a region of at least 30-31 AFP-PNP battalion, including PNP-PPSC and CAFGU forces. This armed force is superior compared to the BHB's big battlefield in the region. As such, the enemy achieved the overwhelming superiority in their launch, sustainable and large -scale campaigns and joint operations against subregion and guerrilla fields that are usually a large company and a large platoon. During the first three years, the resistance of guerrilla forces in the enemy attack of the enemy has been bravely faced by launching offensive in the three fields. As a result, the NPA was able to strengthen and further expand the mass base and successfully conduct a guerrilla campaign against the enemy -made enemy. In the six years from 2017-2022, a total of 455 military actions in the region took place where 306 or 67% of these were tactical offensives while 149 or 33% of the defense battle. A total of 674 (356 KIA, 306 WIA, 2 pow and 10 surrender) enemies were damaged. However, the positive lessons will be released and the starting advancement recorded in the year 2017-2019 will no longer be reluctant, the wind will end in the next four years (2020-2023), impact of the forces on forces as a result of those who are unavoidable serious injuries sustained in defensive battles in the face of exemplary enemy attacks, existence of errors and weakness that have not been fully corrected and of the weakening of effective political work among the people's righteous Lockdown and restriction caused by Covid-19. In the last four years, it is a great deal to carry out the tactical military line to launch widespread and intense <br><br>  14 March 29 2024The Mountain of the Large but the population is thin. Its long-term impact of the NPA's separation from its wells and the foundation of strength that will eventually explore the masses, morally and in the final will lead to the atrition of forces and weakening. It itself enters the enemy's trap to lean the people's army into a decisive battle in a pure military situation for crushing. At the level of operation, the Mayor weakness of the guerrilla forces that have been damaged and the strength of the power is the failure to hold the military initiative and launch the guerrilla action to effectively combat the enemy's opposing and destroying the enemy. It is usually dominant that the military action is launched because of the concern of the enemy. It weakens the decision to fight and the army's moral morally for self-pushed to the fate. Despite this, the Party and NPA units of the NPA has succeeded in making the strength to advance and preserve their strengths. It is a major factor in those who have been trying to correct ideological empiricism at a level; conservatism, passage, guerrillas and militiaism (KPGM) in politics; and bureaucratism and liberalism in the organization. This is done by launching summons, developing social investigations, studies that are targeted, solving problems and to conduct self-criticism. It strengthens the unity and solidarity of the Party's leading organs on the subregion and guerrilla fields. Some advanced subregions also led the practice of developing leadership. However, in parts that are not corrected, the misconceptions of thinking and the wrong styles of leadership and labor still exist in the significant part. The continuing existence of bureaucratism, liberalism and foreigners in certain cadres and leading committees served as rusty existence. They are a stones on the shoulders that both slow down and pull back our revolutionary progress and have suffered the enemy's fight against the enemy. Guerrilla warfare based on continuous expanding and deepening base and mass support. The Party Committee has not effective offensive posture in three fields: political offensive, offensive offensive and offensive to the military to handle the overall initiative in the intervening and fighting against the enemy, which we have effectively performed in the disappointment of OBL II and Oplan Peace. The Party and the NPA was a big end to continuing to reach the vast mass, carrying out the alliance work in the midst of the enemy's resistance to the enemy -suicide campaign, especially the peasant masses and other rural citizens and the city and led them into their struggle for the land, livelihood and rights in accordance with the anti-feudal, anti-fascist and anti-imperialist line and gain their broadest and most exciting support for the promotion of people's war. Impact of the slowdown of effective political work is the narrowing of the revolutionary mass base, the destruction, the destruction of the destruction without having a flaw on the mass of the mass base caused by the ineffectively opposed to the enemy and the enemy of the enemy on the mass base. It further weakened mass support in the NPA and armed struggle. It is also the root cause of Pinpoint Pinpoint operations and enemies of the enemy, NPA units, cadres, party leadership and NPA officials. It is said that in a large part, the enemy succeeded to drive guerrilla forces away from the masses in the framework of the doctrine "Water the water to kill the fish". The existence of the "Mountain" thought is worse for some to deal with the focus of the enemy's focused operations in the two major areas. Its appearance can be reflected in the over -reliance of physical base and action in “succeeded in trying to advance and preserve the party and units and units and new army.” <br><br> March 29, 202415 It is an insightful duty to surgery and achieve the initiative. It also equates the line to fight to strengthen and strengthen while fighting. It emphasizes that active defense is the main content of long -term people's war. The offensive posture is the concrete realization of the defense offensive warfare of the defense to ensure the non-cutting ties of the Party and the NPA to the vast mass at all times. Its concrete expression of the party's tactical military line in the stage of the strategic defensive launch of widespread and intense guerrilla warnings that harvest continued expanding and deeper mass support. Only through this can the active defense of the revolution be fulfilled; On the contrary, it should be decided to dispel the lines that are passive defense, conservatism and purpose. III. Our urgent duty3 thus, to surgery to achieve the initiative is the only remedy to undermine the withdrawals over the past four years and to promote the renewable strengthening of the armed struggle and the NPA. In fulfilling this line, we will be able to complete the middle part requirements to head to the latter part of the strategic defense and to the strategic strategy. In the same way, the ancient to achieve the initiative guarantee the NPA's disappointment in the strategic enemy's strategic campaign and the destruction of the reactionary enemy until it goes to the level that the NPA is able to lead to the strategic offensive stage. The component of the offensive posture and the achievement of the initiative means the comprehensive advancement of the three components of the people's war: developing the people's army and the promotion of armed struggle, agrarian revolution and the construction of the base. The offensive of these three components of the People's War will be at the same time as the offensive posture in the military, the expansion and politics. In the meantime, it is necessary to hold the emphasis on the recovery and repair of the rural basis in the countryside, stimulation of antifreeudal struggles and the advancement of the agrarian revolution. It coincides with anti-fascist and anti-militarizing campaigns in and out of guerrilla zones and revival in the tradition of the peasant masses of the peasant masses to protest their situation. In the midst of this general emphasis, the various sizes and types of tactical offensives should be positioned in order to continue the NPA and revitalize the spirit of the people's armed resistance. Military offensive only in the offensive posture in the military field can the strategic offensive and the encompassing of the more enemy forces. This is because the offensive posture in the military field is the means of implementing active defense as military policy in total and at all times, and in particular, the handling of military initiatives in guerrilla operations at every instance. In guerrilla warfare, life and death are the issue of even the initiative of the initiative will put guerrilla forces in a passionate military situation and extinction. Key to maintaining offensive posture in the military field is the use of contestable tactics, perseverance and tireless mass work, a great combination of military and political struggles, proper laying and structural balance of forces, and properly actively commanding All levels to launch a widespread and intensive guerrilla warfare. The control and leadership of the commander is important at various levels of planning campaigns and anti-campaigns and the construction of 3 major extracts of the major points in extending the luxury role from Joventud del Fierro's role: Several matters and problems with the launch of guerrilla warfare in Southwest, February 2007 <br><br> 16 March 29 2024 Military Plans at the level of military operations. In implementing relatively centralized commanders and abolition of the absolute centralized commander, the initiative and flexibility of military plans at various levels will increase and coordination will be tightened. The Operation of the Guerrilla operating is the tactical tactical refrigerator of the platoon and the unit of the platoon's unit stands the tactical command of all his formations including the dissectful squad and the Tims who play specific missions in the work mass and military work. Tactical NPA tacticals should improve in carrying out the guerrilla operation of concentration, dispersal and timely transfer of forces. The basic basis of the existence of the platoon is through the existence of the tactical chair based on the mainbody of the platoon which is the entire guerrilla operation of the platoon. It is in this sense that the focus directs the entire conduct of the guerrilla operation of the platoon in the entire field. In carrying out plans and missions, proper assignment of forces is important to fulfill military duties at all times. The proper combination and mobilization of platoon (SDG and SYP), squad, specialized guerrilla units (command, partisan, isnayper, sapper team), town militia units and village defense units for specific military missions The Platoon, Field, Provinces and Region is at the level. Be it between the battles or fields of battles, maintaining the offensive military posts by organizing the People's Army of the Popular Defense system in many locals such as the construction and training of militia and units in the village defense, continuous Political and Military Training of Pultaym NPA units, launching recruitment activities, and actively suppressing anti-revolutionaries and spies in the scope of our guerrilla fields. Guerrilla forces should take over the policy to attack and harm the vulnerable and vulnerable part of the enemy as long as it has the opportunity and the circuit allowed. High attention should be given to the anihilative operations as the operations continue to expand. As long as the offensive and resistance are in control, guerrilla forces can maintain the military initiative at all times and every opportunity and will continue to eliminate and weaken the enemy. In order to achieve a pardon tactic, the implementation of the proper structure of the force must be ensured. This means implementing the proper balance of horizontal and vertical forces. Exactly, we must implement the "3-1" aproxies of the realization of the 70-30 policy tactics in the balance of horizontal and vertical guerrilla formations. This means that in every 3 platoon there is a bertical forces and two horizontal forces. In the three squads of each platoon, it also means that one (1) squad is the center-de-gravity and will lead the launch of the military work while two (2) squads will lead the mass work during the time Loda of dispersal. In each scales that are dispersed, it should be divided into three formations in accordance with the formula 3-1 which means that two (2) formations are destined for mass work and one (1) formation focuses on military work. They are further strengthened by optimating militia units to perform armed actions. According to Proper implementation of the structure of horizontal and vertical forces, the relationship between mass work and military work and the launch of the basic to (BTO) and special tactical offensive (here) guerrilla forces should spread themselves in a broader Scope and there perform various forms and types of guerrilla operations such as sabotage, atrition actions and ancient operations to create a major harm to the enemy and pay the trooper to their harassment and damage the base of the base mass. Guerrilla actions can be a combination of timber, squad, platoon or combined platoon for various types of guerrilla operations. To perform <br><br> March 29, 202417 Political Openstivity to launch political offensives need to be active in conjunction . Including this launch the offensive and the propaganda to combat the enemy's disabilities and deception and harvest the favorable public upcoming and popular support for the revolutionary struggle. Essential issues to obtain political initiatives for the promotion of mass struggles, especially the anti-feudal struggle as a major defense against enemy's demonization of the party, NPA and revolutionary movement and active struggle with the enemy's psy-ops, teaching the masses How Make an end to the enemy, actively oppose the RCSPO's schemes and deception and dealing with militarization and military terrorism. The NPA and the NPA needs to unite with the widest ranks of the people. The anti-feudal struggle is tightly held as the key link of the mass work in the countryside. In the face of the destruction of life and livelihood and the suffering of the peasant masses and citizens in the countryside, their cry cries to lower the land rent, raise the wages of the farm worker, eliminate the USURA, lower the price of farm inputs and raise the price of the farm product. The masses are strongly demanded to withdraw the lands that were seized from them and fighting the destructive-to-livelihood and environmental projects of enemies such as mines, plantations, ekoturism projects, giant infrastructure and the likes. Mobilize the masses especially the victims, along with their fellow and friendly forces to combat the atrosity and violations of human rights and international humanitarian laws, the Red Army must have the Party leadership of the Eternal heroism to overcome Difficulties, dangers and obstacles and fulfilling military duties. It should be a step-by-step-up to increase the NPA throughout the region to subregion/provinces and guerrillas until the platoon's breeding is re-established and established a large guerrilla field consisting of a minimum three platoon in accordance with the formula formula 3-1 balance of vertical and horizontal platoon. The NPA will be called to the NPA of local forces and forces from the city to quickly increase the NPA as the main mass organization of the Party in the countryside. Political work should be stimulated among the masses in the locality, especially among the peasant masses as the main source of new Sampa in the NPA. Call for the launch of these altogether to trigger weapons and support from the masses and friends of the revolution. The NPA needs to learn to disappear into the enemy's eyes and ears with the validity of the stretching and deep mass base and need to learn to create many traces and noise in the wider area to disrupt and distance the focus of the enemy from a few NPA target units of incessant attack. It is also necessary to learn to struggle to ensure that the masses are not broken. <br><br>  18 March 29 2024 Citizens in the affected areas of militarization. Perform the offensive in propaganda and make sure it lands on the masses. Study and carry out the resolution of the regional conference in propaganda and culture work. Break the issues and struggles of the masses, their grievances and successes. Assert the justice of resistance and revolution as the natural and irrevocable right of the Filipino people. Speakers of the revolutionary mass organizations and the NPA commanders need to be active in propaganda to clarify the revolutionary stance on various issues and to counter and refine the anti-communist Destruction and enemy's destruction. In the launch of military operations, it needs to be political and implications for the public's public ups to launch offensives. Always consider international war protocols and carhrihl in the launch of military operations. Expect the enemy to take advantage of the errors of the revolutionary movement to compensate the anti-communist and anti-terrorist hysteria and discredit the CPP-BHB-NDFP in the public eye. Expansion offensive We need to be successful in expanding and deepening the mass base and effectively fighting enemy operations in order to deprive us of the base. The enemy-based strategy should be actively restrained and frustrated that the main content is to launch focuses and containing capaigns or campaigns that focus on a chunk of priority territory for destroying and in secondary territories for contingent. The strategy of being a-based strategy is anchored to the one-time destroying priority of the pebble and long-term weakening of the conceded. In order to face and escape the People's Army and the revolutionary movement of the poverty of the assembly campaign, proper policy and tactics will be offensive in expanding and quickly opening new places for guerrilla warfare. When the enemy is extensively doing. Basically these were killing, forced surrender, mental and physical torture, illegal arrest and confinement, uninterrupted bombing and shooting both from the land and the air and other demonic armed forces of US imperialism and local ruling Comradary-landlords. Make a rule that will not miss an enemy's atrosity. All state crimes must be exposed, sued and fighting. It is necessary to solve how the masses and fear of the masses are broken to express their opposition to the military terrorism that is implemented in areas of FMOs and RCSPOs. In these areas, the fear and doubt of the masses are usually dominant especially if the RCSPO has done to destroy the confidence of the masses through the cornerstone and reversible villagers. In this regard, it is a trend in the mass of mass and even in the NPA units of the Party and organs of the Party the regular launch of the grievance meeting in which each person expresses their particular experience of oppression and exploitation of the ruling system and the Its fascist agent. It will gradually create the climate of the individual and collective class hatred to those who oppress and exploit them and the high desire to compensate for the enemies through revolutionary resistance. In our experience, propaganda campaigns can be greatly done in city centers to the navel of the Philippines to bring and address the issue of militarization and violations of the people's rights. The power of such campaigns will further strengthen and sustain the active action of “when widespread and many places open for guerrilla warfare, the enemy can push us to many places, thinning his limited forces and exposed his operating troop to be arrested. ” <br><br> March 29, 202419 Neighborhood Platoes of Syp carrying out mass work and military duties. Enhance the deduction of armed and armed, open and secret people's organizations and actions to expand in areas that are not immediately covered by the armed organization of the People's Army. Actively mobilize allies and middle forces to expand their ranks and develop open and legal organizations or leadership and transform traditional standing organizations already. Study and correct with the fulfillment of the responsibility to offensive and achieve the initiative, we must strictly fulfill the Central Committee of the Central of the Central to correct the errors, strengthen the party and advance the democratic revolutionary people through the Long -term people's war. Correction will be done through the critical ones in its own collection of experience in promoting long -term people's war over the last 7 years. In order to keep the practice of practicing practice, it is necessary to study and review the Party's basic principles, Review the Central Committee's statement on the 55th anniversary of the Party and NPA and from this The practice of advancing the long-term people's war is the thoughts and practices that violate it and bring us serious injuries and retreats to the seven-year-old passed. Always apply to the concrete practice of leadership in the South Revolution the universal theory of MLM, basic revolutionary principles of the party and instructions and guidance of the Central Committee in the Central Condition and Practice of the Citizens and the revolutionary forces in TK and in every locality who Cover of each organ of the party, KHB's command and unit. Plus, it is always humble and self -critical in examining our practice, taking lessons from them and in criticizing and criticizing our mistakes. By this, we will be successful in our struggle to achieve the urgent and long -term duties that the Party clarifies. Most of the students and many places are open for guerrilla warfare, the enemy can push us to many places, to spread its limited forces, and to expose its operating troops to many vulnerable places for the resources. On the one hand, temporary injuries that can be caused by long -term campaigns for finding and destroying priorities and secondary priorities areas will be revoked by expanding and opening many areas for guerrilla warfare. The slowdown of one part will be revoked by the growth of many parts. Party organizations are actively actively mobilized in locality, village activists and members of the mass organization for coordination and expansion within the village and in neighboring areas. Make their relatives, acquaintances and friends a bridge to neighboring villages to expand our relationship and mass organization. Assign units to expand the areas of the adjoining guerrilla fields. Return, recover and appreciate the areas that are temporarily left behind as a result of strong and long -term search and destruction operations. Make sure that the power of the appointed unit should be enough, with a reliable leadership and a unit unit that will be military force. Leave enough-the-strong forces in areas that are strongly attacked to deal with and overlook the enemy and lead the masses while transferring other forces to areas that are loose for expansion and mass work. Members of the revolutionary organizations in the locality are quickly taken into the people's army. Those who are not ready to act on the pillar and can still pursue will be assigned to other places that they will be able to move for expansion tasks. Assign the SDG platoes to the specific AOR that will be an anchor of their military work, consolidation and expansion. SDG platoes should be positioned at the location that strategic anchor of operations of the <br><br> 20 Patas 29 March 2024 the masses in different parts of the country in the face of drought and the destruction of the plant; Meanwhile, it has recently suffered wide floods and landslides in much of Mindanao. The livelihood of millions of farmers in debt, sales of their produce, and lands and livelihoods. In the city and the whole country, the widespread workers and the toiling masses are suffering in front of the rising prices of goods and low wages, salaries and income. The toiling masses and the people are shouting revolutionary justice, freedom and democracy. The demand for the NPA is very difficult and launching a successful tactical offensive. All NPA -Party and NPA officials need to learn how to handle and use this objective factor for new strengthening. There is no other way to regain the initiative and to strengthen it again but to the active fight - to fight to strengthen and to strengthen while fighting. History and the current state of the working class and the working class in the world and our own people. Emphasize our spirit of the inspiration of the golden lessons in the brilliant revolutionary tradition especially in the promotion of the armed struggle of the earlier generations of the Filipino revolutionaries in accordance with the teachings of our great chairman Amado Guerro. Let us hold the strict weapons and the eternal courage, the bravery and determination of our people to fight the foreign conquering and their local ruling class.
