 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  A week of protest was enough for 
 make the us usually measured minister of the University lose your head e 
 of the research Anna Maria Bernini who yesterday, alarmed by two 
 disputes simultaneously, in Rome and Genoa, thought of calling 
 the police chief Vittorio Pisani for a comparison on the "situation 
  within the universities ".
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  An irrews that, in addition to 
 seem a rude to the competent minister, planted, betrays the 
 nervousness of the right government in front of the mobilizations of young people. 
  Only 18 months have passed since Meloni, in his speech of 
 settlement said "contest me, be hungry, be crazy and also 
 free »to young people. An evident boutade that has not convinced anyone 
 also because already a few days later the chronicles recorded the use of 
 Manganelli against students.

 demonstrate to adhere to the government's majority party line

  An indication that, in the intentions, 
 it should serve to diminish the strong anti-war instances of the movement 
  student who, after Naples and Turin, has occupied the 
  Sapienza and manifested in Genoa to ask for the interruption of the announcement 
 of collaboration between Italy and Israel (Maeci) and relations with 
 Leonardo and Med-Or Foundation, chaired by Marco Minniti.

  <strong>
   What you though
  </strong>
  The 
 government pretends not to see is that the mobilization against the 
 militarization of Italian universities starts from long before the 
 contingency of the news and the massacre of the population of Gaza has it 
 made only more urgent. Even two years ago, at the end of March 2022, the first 
 University of the capital was occupied to protest against 
 the escalation in Ukraine with the request to cut the agreements between 
 Sapienza and Leonardo.

  In addition to the PNRR, there is also a PNRM, 
 National Plan of Military Research, involving Ministries of 
 Defense and education and university. The central role of the system 
 university for strengthening the military sector is emphasized 
 also from the programmatic document 2020-22 of the General Staff of 
 Defence. Also in 2022 a protocol between crui was signed 
 (Conference of Rectors) and Leonardo Med-Or to intensify the 
 collaboration.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  According to the data published on the website of 
  same aerospace group, at the moment Leonardo has a 
 sixty research projects with the Italian universities plus five 
 Framework agreements with as many universities (Polimi, Polito, La Sapienza, 
 University of Genoa and Bologna). The army also moved: the 
 Federico II of Naples, for example, has long started an agreement-four 
  with the center high studies for the defense (Casd) and the Operations Command 
 On the Network of the General Staff to develop common projects.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  As the No Muos movement explains 
 Sicilian in a recent dossier on university and war, the slip 
 from knowledge as a place of peace to the knowledge for war is due 
  to the intertwining of different interests: «The merely economic one e 
 Remunction: the war companies that finance research do not do it 
  in a disinterested way but they create profit and can draw on a 
 large basin of interns and trainees to be used at their own 
 structures; Another end is political and propaganda, with one 
 universities that lends itself on the one hand to legitimize aggressions 
 imperialist and, on the other, to spread the culture of defense and 
  safety in the territories, which serves to normalize the war and its 
 consequences".
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>
   The Observatory
  </strong>
  against 
 the militarization of the schools, which for years has collected and archives the 
 reports on the interference of the police in education, has 
  launched a petition last January, «outside the universities from 
 Med -or/Leonardo, producer of weapons and death », to ask 
 rectors to give up their positions within the foundation he has 
 Over thirty thousand signatures collected.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  “When university research is 
 financed by this type of companies, direct relapse is on the projects of 
  research that are bound by the strategic choices of companies that 
 they aim the growth of the war sector in a context in which 
 the under the public funding of the universities puts the crisis in crisis 
 universities, "says Margherita Esposito of the Union of University students, while 
  the collective change course, the architect of the actions of the last 
 days, call to mass mobilization for April 16.
