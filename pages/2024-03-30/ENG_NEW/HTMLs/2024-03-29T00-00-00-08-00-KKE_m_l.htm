  We denounce in the most categorical way yesterday's repression against protesters who gathered outside the concert set up by the US-NATO commandos. Workers and people were confronted with shields, chemicals and shine of repressive forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again it turns out in the most categorical way that the presence of killers next to our homes is a government's commitment to US imperialists. That's why they didn't want the fiesta to spoil them.

  On behalf of the local bourgeoisie, they are committed to their foreign bosses and have turned Thessaly and almost wholehearted the country into a large platform for the killings. They give them land, air and water involving the people and the country in their dangerous war plans. While turning the country into a magnet for the weapons of their opponents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The support of the ND government in defending US interests in the region such as the country's involvement in the US-EU-British intervention in the Red Sea, or on the Ukraine front, brings the clouds of the war closer to us.

  The most meaningful way of responding to yesterday's repression and complaint of the presence of Americans in Larissa and across the country are workers, people and youths shouting their opposition to the policy of dependence, exploitation, fascism and fascism and fascism. War!
