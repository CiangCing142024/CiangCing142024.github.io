   From Rome to Bari and Bologna - Not only Gaza. Students and prof. they want it 
 stop to scientific cooperation with Israel and the rectors outside of 
 Med-Or. And meanwhile Bernini calls the police ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The University of Turin took place on 7 March last from the agreement 
 industrial, scientific and technological cooperation between Italy and 
 Israel. And to have advanced the same freezing proposal - Previa 
 check "case by case" of the related research calls with Tel Aviv - is 
 was the rector of Bari, Stefano Bronzini, who confirmed yesterday at
   <em>
    Done
   </em>
   to have also resigned from the scientific council of the Foundation 
 Med-OR, Leonardo's creature born to promote research and safety, 
  And that ended up in the center of protests these days. They are only the 
 first results of the struggle of student groups from all over Italy, 
 returned to protest from Rome to Genoa, passing through Bologna and Bari. They are 
  At least 20 universities in protest - including Roma Tre and Tor Vergata, 
 Trento, Florence, Pisa, Milan and Milan -Bicocca, Naples and Bologna - e 
 They see for the first time a welding between students and teachers and 
 researchers for "smilitarization" and the autonomy of universities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Yesterday the collective "change course", after having occupied the 
 Rectorate of wisdom, he tried to break away - rejected by the 
 Police - During the meeting of the academic Senate, with the rector 
 Antonella Polimeni - also in the scientific council of Med -Or - that 
  refused the requests for meeting. Same blitz, rejected, in Genoa.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Three points on which students are looking for dialogue with rectors e 
 teachers. In the center, the scientific announcement published on November 21 e 
 promoted by Maeci for an "industrial cooperation agreement, 
 Scientific and Technological Italy-Israel ": aimed at universities 
 Italian, the announcement expires April 10. On February 29 almost two thousand between 
 Italian teachers and researchers signed a letter sent to 
 Foreign Minister, Antonio Tajani, where it is stated that "the 
 financing could be used to develop technology
   <em>
    dual use
   </em>
   , 
  or both civil and military use, and that the third line of 
 financing of optical technologies could be used for 
 develop
   <em>
    device
   </em>
   of the latest generation surveillance, also a 
  war use ". The request is: suspend the agreements until the cease 
  Fire of Israel. The theme of
   <em>
    dual use
   </em>
   It is central. Fight 
 of the collectives is concrete and was born from the Observatory against the 
 militarization of schools and university, which is inspired by work 
  of prof. Michele Lancione, professor of the Polytechnic of Turin. In his 
 book
   <em>
    University and militarization
   </em>
   (Eris, 2023), Lancione 
 It outlines the dense relationship between the Polytechnic and Leonardo. Ethical interests 
  or civilians? Change course, in a detailed dossier, points out how 
 "In the last balance of 2022 (Leonardo,
   <em>
    ndr
   </em>
   ) declares that 
 it creates 83% of the turnover in the defense sector, having almost alone 
 government customers (88%) ". The same Leonardo who" in July 2022 has 
 Purchased the Israeli company Rada Electronic Industries, 
 Specialized in Radar for short -range defense and antihyrones ".

   <br/>
   Here the third question comes into play: the participation of the universities al 
  Scientific Committee of the Med-OR Foundation (which stands for 
 Medium-orient), which was born from a rib of Leonardo and is chaired 
 by the former Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti. Students talk about it 
 Like "a
   <em>
    think tank
   </em>
   (...) which aims to support 
 Through studies and analysis the imperialist policies ". According to i 
 collective, the project tends "to exploit the young minds of the 
 students at the service of military interests ". In the Scientific Committee 
  16 Italian rectors and other academics sit. Among these Franco 
 Catholic rings, Giorgio Barba Navaretti of the Milan Statale, 
  Massimiliano Fiorucci of Romatre, Tiziana Lippiello della Ca 'Foscari e 
  Alessandra Petrucci of the Unifi. But someone has already chosen to do a 
 step back: he is the rector of Uniba, Stefano Bronzini, who welcomed 
 the invitation to get out of the
   <em>
    board
   </em>
   Scientific of Med-Or. The target 
  It is freezing research projects in partnership with Israel "such as 
 We did with Russia in 2022, as long as they put us back not the 
 Students ", underlines Bronzini. who also communicated the decision to 
 Giovanna Iannantuoni, president of the Crui (Conference of the Rectors of 
 Italian university) "to which I said I am still alive - he says 
 sarcastic - I had a comparison with the students, I was not surrounded 
 from the Sioux ".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   It is no coincidence that the results obtained by the collectives alarmed 
 the government. Where now we come to talk about "brigatist danger". As 
 told by
   <em>
    Done
   </em>
   The entourage of the Undersecretary 
 Giovanbattista Fazzolari has already evoked the BR in a "information note a 
  internal use ". While yesterday the president of the Senate, Ignazio La Russa a
   <em>
    The truth
   </em>
   He ventured: "The years of lead began like this". In short, the 
 Student ferment does not like the right of government. Which brake 
 Put the youthful ferment? Yesterday the minister of the Anna University 
 Maria Bernini heard the police chief Vittorio Pisani, and the 
 Minister of the Interior, Matteo planted, with whom he will confront 
 in the next days. The goal is always the same: to repress the 
 dissent, even when argued.
