<strong>
   Call to the 27th Congress of Atik
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In the process of increasing the imperialist contradictions and the war policies implemented and the world is dragged into a new imperialist war, the attacks on our democratic rights continue in the European geography. With all the reactionary laws enacted, his life is taken to a subpoena in his immigrants with domestic workers and laborers. Increased inflation rates, the decreasing effect of purchasing power, the masses of access to basic needs are difficult to reach, the masses continue to go to the streets.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   Refugees are struggling at the expense of their lives on migration roads. The EU continues to take away the democratic rights of immigrants with the laws it implements and enacted. By criminalizing immigrant institutions, they are trying to take away our rights of organization.
  </p>
<p>
   All this attack fury and the imperialist occupation/war situation, we need to struggle with the domestic working class and to dimension our struggle against the racism developed in all areas we are in, against imperialist policies.
  </p>
<p>
   In order to discuss all these developments, to produce ideas together and to present a perspective to the future, we call on our 27th Congress!

You could also see, as a group of these women, they went through the D1 stores, banks, the big monopolies, writing up the oppressed, below the oppressors! In addition, several women hit posters, against imperialism and the heroic struggle of the Palestinian people.

    As soon as the prosecution came, popular women with their fury shouted justice! They stirred the posters against the prosecutor's fence, moved from steel and removed an advertising fence from the place, there they concentrated demanding justice, and they were available to a tribute proposed by the popular female movement, in this, the names of the Women victims of femicide, while a partner gave a few words against the state of landowners and great bourgeois, who oppress the women of the people, through submission and fear, and who encourage the ideology of the dominant classes, machismo. They denounced how bourgeois women did not have the same conditions as the women of the people, and how that sexual oppression that the women of the people live, serves the bourgeois for that double exploitation, subjecting half of the people to work in bad conditions, supporting under the "
    <em>
     Deficit nature
    </em>
    ”, Domestic work as a woman's task, when this work allows the maintenance of labor for employers. Finally, a call was made to the organization of women of the town, to be that female ferment that transforms the society of misery and pain, all those cases of the women of the people, can only have justice in a society that is at the service of the women and men of the people.

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-69b91d40ff556fbeb16a13deb215949b">
    After the tribute, companions approached the microphone, to tell how sexual oppression had lived, as from girls, this society with decadent ideas oppresses them, reducing their role to sexual objects. Each of them told how he has suffered in this society for machismo, in the midst of tears and pain, they reaffirmed the path that popular women have in this society, that path is the popular struggle, which guarantees that women can reach their rights , and advancing in the struggle towards the revolution, where a new society can be achieved, a society where there is justice and women have a role in social production and in the construction of a society at the service of the people.

   Comrade Roldán began greeting the immense day of March 8, starring thousands and thousands of women and diversities throughout the country, which he described as a “historical event” in response to Milei's speech in the opening of sessions in the Congress, and said “I think the report of the January Central Committee and subsequent political hours still have validity. We were at the head of the fight since the beginning of the Milei cycle, as we defined in the Central Committee of November last year. ” He then went on to develop some issues of the international situation and how they are expressed in Argentina, "since there are changes at high speed, which force new elements."

<strong>
     War factors grow in the world
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   We have been saying that the imperialist dispute grows in the world and war factors grow.
  </p>
<p>
   There is the commercial war that has worsened. The Chinese economy has long stopped growing to the rhythm in which it came and suffered the real estate crisis, first of the giant Evergrande and now from another giant that is Country Garden. It is a hard blow to its economy since the real estate sector represents between 25% and 30% of the Chinese economy. It has four months of deflation. The unemployment among young people reached, according to official figures, 15% at the end of 2023; until they suspended the publication of the data.
  </p>
<p>
   This has produced a contraction of its domestic market and an overproduction at low prices that you need to export. Therefore, a world price war is open. For example, China is the first world producer of electric cars and has a brutal overproduction that needs to export, first, to Europe. A Europe that oscillates between the recession and the stagnation.
  </p>
<p>
   China monopolizes 80 % of the solar panel market and 50 % of lithium batteries, for what the lithium of Argentina, Chile and Bolivia needs.
  </p>
<p>
   This situation of the Chinese economy hits the entire world economy, even the Yankees, which although part of their Chinese economy has unconcerned (in 2023 imports from China) dropped 20%, they still have a high degree of interaction.
  </p>
<p>
   The United States continues to be the main economy of the world and have been able to overcome the crisis. Registered a 3.3% increase in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2023. In turn, it must be taken into account that the high interest rates with which it fought inflation remains a risk to its economy.
  </p>
<p>
   The election campaign for the end of the year elections and the possibility of Trump's triumph will influence throughout this year.
  </p>
<p>
   What I mean, summarized, is that a fierce dispute is open for markets, which accelerates war possibilities.
  </p>
<p>
   World military spending has increased 9% by 2023 compared to the previous year, reaching the record of 2.2 billion dollars.
  </p>
<p>
   Two years of the invasion of Russian imperialism have been completed to Ukraine. The country is devastated. The counteroffensive that Zelensky undertook failed and could only advance a few kilometers. The Russians have improved their defenses, and having liquidated Putin the Wagner group (Russian paramilitary group) was able to unify the military command.
  </p>
<p>
   Internally continues to control, from a police state, the growing discontent of the Russian people with the war.
  </p>
<p>
   NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) has just carried out the greatest military exercises since the end of the Cold War, more than 90,000 soldiers from more than a dozen countries participate. Faced with the threat of French president Macron, to send troops to Ukraine, Putin replied: “West must realize that we also have weapons that can achieve objectives in their territory. All this really threatens with a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilization. ”
  </p>
<p>
   In the US, the Trump sector traces the expansion of help to Ukraine and has questioned the continuity of NATO if it reaches the government.
  </p>
<p>
   In Europe, questions grow in NATO countries to military aid to Ukraine, when their economies are in some cases stagnant and in others in recession. There is a radicalization of workers' struggles that have broken into different countries in Europe, such as France, England and Germany. Peasant struggles have also moved Europe and besieged cities such as Paris, Madrid and Brussels.
  </p>
<p>
   Within this framework, right -wing sectors such as neo -Nazis in Germany, Le Pen in France, the sectors that direct Italy with Giorgia Meloni, the PVV (party for freedom) in Holland, President Orbán in Hungary, among others.
  </p>
<p>
   The other serious conflict is the genocide that Israel's government is committing over the Palestinian people. With more than 30,000 dead, many of them children, and 70% of destroyed homes. Now Israel has mounted a famine campaign in Gaza. A true extermination campaign that few in Argentina are denouncing. In Brazil, Lula da Silva condemned Israel's genocide.
  </p>
<p>
   All imperialisms prepare for war. Yankees in alliance mainly with England and NATO in the West; and with Japan, South Korea and Australia in the Indo-Pacific. They play in the Ukraine War, support Israel in the Palestinian genocide, attack Yemen's rebels to maintain the navigability of the Red Sea, where hutis attacks have made many ships take alternative paths. Yankees also seek to recover land in Latin America. But they continue to concentrate the main forces in the Indo-Pacific in their dispute with Chinese imperialism.
  </p>
<p>
   Chinese imperialism announced on Tuesday, February 5, an increase of 7.2% in its defense budget. At high speed they have doubled China's atomic arsenal reaching approximately 500 nuclear eyes. They have developed hypersonic missiles that are not detected by Yankees radars. In addition to having the largest permanent army in the world, China recently threw its third aircraft carrier and established a military base in Yibuti, in the horn of Africa.
  </p>
<p>
   Russia remains a military superpower with thousands of stored nuclear eyes.
  </p>
<p>
   Japan announced that it doubles its military budget and plans to take it to 2% of GDP in 2027. Its objective is to become the third military power of the world.
  </p>
<p>
   The Australian government announced that it will double the size of the fleet of its Navy from World War II, compared to possible threats in the region. That is to say that everyone is preparing for war.
  </p>
<p>
</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>
     The imperialist dispute in Latin America grows
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   In November, the Chancay Megaport in Peru, built by the Chinese on the Pacific, with 16 feet of draft. That will absorb exports to China of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and mainly from the states of western Brazil, which would save almost two weeks of travel and stop using the Panama Canal.
  </p>
<p>
   Ecuador has just signed a free trade agreement with China. In other words, Ecuador and Peru, with right -wing governments, are also part of that dispute.
  </p>
<p>
   The Yankees have advanced in Paraguay and are concentrating troops at the birth of the so -called hydrovy.
  </p>
<p>
   In our country, Milei, as we have said, leads us to subordination relations with Yankee imperialism, English imperialism and Israel's fascist government. It is the first time, since 1983, that an Argentine president does not claim Argentine sovereignty about Malvinas in his speech in Congress.
  </p>
<p>
   In this dispute situation in the world, the game to which the government takes is very dangerous for the Argentine nation and people. If we look at it from the war point of view, we have in our Falkland Islands the English usurpers with the main military base of the South Atlantic. Now they just unilaterally expand their control over maritime areas of the Falkland Islands, where they prohibited navigation and fishing. This is 166 thousand km2, which will be added to 283 thousand km2 on which they already imposed exclusion. From there they also intend to control access to Antarctica.
  </p>
<p>
   The Uruguay government makes an extension of the port, which from the Macri government is the director of the Río de la Plata, to take it to 14 meters, and Milei accepts it. This implies a resignation of fact to the Magdalena Canal project.
  </p>
<p>
   In April, the Country Laura Richardson, commander of the Southern Command Yanqui, visited the country (which highlighted the American interest in lithium, oil and fresh water in Latin America). Also in April, joint exercises are announced between the prefecture of Patricia Bullrich and a unit of the Yankee Coast Guard; And in November a Defense Summit of the hemisphere, promoted by the United States, would take place in Buenos Aires.
  </p>
<p>
   In May, the George Washington Nuclear Propulsion Avions would arrive. It is the main vessel of the seventh Yankee fleet, based in Japan.
  </p>
<p>
   That is to say, in a South Atlantic where there are hundreds of Chinese ships fishing and doing military intelligence, the Milei government puts the Yankee Navy in the Argentine Sea, which in addition, from Paraguay controls the birth of the hydrovy.
  </p>
<p>
   This in a country where the Chinese have a base in Neuquén, where China is one of the main buyers of our exports, and where many provinces depend on trade with China. This Milei policy deepens and aggravates the dispute. That is why the interview and the agreements of the Chinese ambassador with Kicillof are not a detail in which they agreed to "reinforce bilateral links."
  </p>
<p>
   In this context, Cristina Kirchner published a letter, where she tells these sectors of the ruling classes that trade with China that there is no problem in discussing labor reform, that there is no problem in discussing privatizations. But the problem is the "dollarization" that would bind us to the Yankee economy and it is very difficult to leave once specified.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>
     It is a good time for PCR growth
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   I think the national situation is expressed in the January report and subsequent political hours. We were at the head of the fight since the beginning of the Milei cycle, as we defined in the Central Committee of November 2023.
  </p>
<p>
   We were in the mobilizations on the anniversary of Argentinazo on December 19 and 20 and in the multisectoral march to court on December 27.
  </p>
<p>
   The national strike of January 24 put the working class in the center of the political scene, the days of the unemployed and precarious movements of the CCC and the UTEP of 16 and that of February 23 with 500 Route cuts. The FNC was at the head of the peasant fighting days. There were railways, of UTA, teachers, state, the struggle of banking, the cut of acindar workers in Villa Constitución, the day of the women's movement this Friday throughout the country.
  </p>
<p>
   We had the university march in La Plata, struggles of researchers from CONICET, of the sectors of culture, and we could continue to appoint. There are the multisectoral that have developed throughout the country where we converge with many allies and also with many sectors we hit together.
  </p>
<p>
   We understand that it is necessary to take into account the international scenario, the inter -imperialist dispute and as expressed in Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
   The unemployment and mobilization of 24/1 was a blow to Milei's policy and deepened the differences between different sectors of the ruling classes, which made extraordinary sessions in the Congress for the treatment of the Bus Law.
  </p>
<p>
   Because in Argentina they all work, the Yankees, the English, the Israeli Mossad, the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and the Europeans. They work economically and also with their agents on all political, union and social forces. Also about us. Many times we have the spine and put themselves next to us in the fight. We have to specify when we hit together with different sectors and who our allies are. Because the main coup of the popular struggle is directed to the most reactionary sector of the Dominant classes block, which is expressed today.
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore, with some sectors that have contradictions with Milei, such as a governor, an argument is whether we hit them together, or we consider them as allies in the popular struggle. We place ourselves independently. We defend our line and our history.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>
     For an active and multisectoral national strike against hunger, delivery and repression
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p p="">
<p>
    In this political situation and at this time, an issue that we have to discuss is the secondarization of PCR. The discussion we made and are reflected in the materials of the 13th National Congress of our party on strategic shift, we have to focus. We have to continue building the PCR and transform it into the party capable of directing the revolution that our country needs. And demonstrate at the mass level with which line can be advanced. And if we lose sight of the situation of the masses or we are wrong in the assessment of the political moment, the actions of the party and its JCR are very difficult.
   </p>
<p>
    If we do not have a revolutionary strategy, we have another strategy. In the heat of the fight it is necessary to battle that shift, because we were not born as a party to be the left of the system.
   </p>
<p>
    We are in the midst of stormy times, and we have to prepare and prepare the masses to be able to fulfill our role if the situation is precipitated. In front of a reactionary government like this, how do we respond to a repressive blow?
   </p>
<p>
    To overcome this weakness and hierarchize the game, I understand that we have to go to a reputation campaign to strengthen ourselves. A campaign that begins with the month of the press and culminates with the financial campaign. We are going to see all the companions and colleagues, so that they reaffirm if they are still revolutionary communists, where they work and how they quote. We have to guarantee the political debate of all affiliates to see events come before.
   </p>
<p>
    Because the strategic shift is not only the weakness of work in the labor movement, but the cellular functioning of the party, the month of the press, the quotes.
   </p>
<p>
    If the situation sharpens and the events precipitate, the question is whether we are in a position to play, and how far, or we will be critical spectators.
   </p>
<p>
    The best experiences show that where affiliation to the PCR is proposed to the JCR; He became. It is a good time to grow.
   </p>
<p>
    We have to advance in work in the concentration centers in each area or province. In this we have to take stock of how we work for the national strike of January 24 in each of them.
   </p>
<p>
    We raised in November that we were opposition to this government, and that we were going to face. We were consistent with what we said. We did more in some places than others. Taking into account that we are a socially, political and culturally divided society.
   </p>
<p>
    In the dispute over the political direction of the masses, an important issue is whether we are willing to run the fate of the workers, the peasants and the people, or we are going to keep ourselves.
   </p>
<p>
    For example, in the face of layoffs, we promote active and multisectoral strike, to help all who are fighting. In Acindar we went out to fight, and that is extraordinary. Have initiatives at the specific moment.
   </p>
<p>
    The government has cut width and unity possibilities are very large. In multisectorals, sectors of the national bourgeoisie that resist, because this policy hits them is participating. That is in favor and we have to fight to influence. Always fighting that the working class is in the center of regroups. Because as far as I know, the national bourgeoisie will not lead the struggle for national and social liberation.
   </p>
<p>
    We fight that the masses do not delegate, that is our center. That is why we promote assemblies in the factories, in the countryside, in the neighborhoods, workplaces etc., because we must not underestimate the masses. Let's look at the extraordinary mobilization of March 8, that great response of thousands of women and diversities throughout the country to the challenging speech of Milei on 1/3 in Congress.
   </p>
<p>
    There are many struggles in the country. We have to argue where we are and where not.
   </p>
<p>
    How will the government do to sustain the adjustment? This does not close without repression. That's why we talk about preparing the masses. This must be seen in particular, here and in each of the zonal. Because as in everything, there is a relationship between our line in general, and the specific line in each area.
   </p>
<p>
    In the midst of these struggles, we have to have initiatives. The National Day of the CCC and the UTEP and other organizations of 18/3 with route cuts throughout the country and here in the accesses to the Federal Capital is important. And we prepare for a great day of fighting on 24/3 raising: “No to the impunity of yesterday and today 30,000 detainees- missing, present! Now and always!". 48 years after the coup d'etat and the beginning of the most bloody genocidal dictatorship that Argentina met, we marched throughout the country.
   </p>
<p>
    And on April 2; 42 years after the recovery of our islands, we claim all who fought and died in defense of our homeland. The Malvinas are a fundamental part of the fight for national sovereignty, amid the growing dispute of imperialist powers and their war preparations.
   </p>
<p>
    90 days after the assumption of the new government, anger and anger are growing, in front of a Milei that appeared as the new. Hunger grows, the situation of the masses is very hard, with boys and retirees passing great needs. What do we do, look the other way?
   </p>
<p>
    We don't have to contrast one thing with the other. Replace the "O" with the "Y". We are able to play an important role in a broad front that ends up imposing another policy and another government.

    From our party and its JCR we promote the broadest unity to face Milei's policy, which aims for few for few, with the majority mired in hunger and misery, and with the auction of national sovereignty. In these new conditions, the unity of the popular, patriotic and democratic sectors is essential to defend the conquered, fight for what is missing, stop the reactionary offensive and create the conditions to advance with the masses on the liberating path.

March 18 - Solidarity day with political prisoners - Tribute to communist and revolutionary prisoners on March 18 is International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Founded by the Comimintern in 1920, the Red rescue declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the birth of the Paris Commune, "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners was expressed around the world. At each period of history, the operating and oppression systems in which we have lived for thousands of years have been the subject of great resistance, and the price to be paid was high. The reaction of the dominant classes to each fight against dominant operating systems, against each resistance, was the same: to crush each movement which opposes their existence in order to preserve it and, above all, destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has accumulated against the dominant order, the movement which arises from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right track under a good direction. This is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel anger and the desire to change the people and isolate from the people those who cannot be destroyed. The other dimension of intolerance and the aggression of ruling classes against revolutionary, communist and democratic popular movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and repressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will make you the same <br/><br/>  thing "." The philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways, what matters is to transform it. ", Said Karl Marx, the great master of the proletariat. Communists and revolutionaries are fighting for realization From this ideal, they are murdered for this, they are imprisoned for this. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown many times in torture and prisons that as long as continuous life, large examples can be created for prosecution of the class struggle in all the circumstances of life. This path requires taking these risks and it is with this awareness that the Communists and the revolutionaries fight against the operating systems in place. The body of each communist and revolutionary Assassinated, each time spent in prison also laid the foundations for the construction of the Future Society. The bourgeoisie and its lacqua want to guarantee capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered in prisons under the most oppressive conditions. The communist and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to transform the prisons, where the enemy feels the strongest, into a class of class struggle. This is why we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis of their justice and support them. Communists and revolutionaries are not only murdered, imprisoned and tortured because they have alternative ideas with existing operating systems, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is above all an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable classes. Since the objective conditions of the imperialist system keep constant and current the contradiction between the oppressor and the oppressed, the assassination and the imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries do not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the worsening of contradictions are reflected directly in class contradictions and the void left by the revolutionaries and the murdered and imprisoned communists is filled by new people. Insofar as the contradictions of the steering system deepens themselves and its dead ends are increasing, insofar as their fear of the "gravedigger" increases, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their real character more and more concretely . At the same time, the crisis of the system which is deepened and does not resolve leads to the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting of all kinds to centralize more the mechanism of the sovereign state, both with its laws and with its factual organizations , and to put more forward the mechanisms of oppression. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which qualify as "ideal democracies" and "progressive", the successive laws on security, the new laws extending the powers of the state's repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left aside The possibility of carrying the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie restores her position against the working class, the oppressed workers and the oppressed peoples with all her reactionism. In the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, the forms <br/><br/> Government parliamentarians and extra-parliamentary with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual regimes. In these countries, all opponents, starting with the communists and the revolutionaries, are subject to a systematic and permanent terror of state. The depth of the contradiction between the dominant classes and the oppressed peoples in these countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, which can only maintain submission to imperialism by a regime of overwhelming terror against the people, the terror of state is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are just a cover for fascism, reaction and state terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The ruling classes of Turkey, India, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, Israel, etc. Strengthen isolation in all possible forms in order to hold prisoners in prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many sick prisoners are abandoned and assaults against prisoners are repeated. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are imprisoned as a price for the Kurdish national liberation struggle. In Turkish prisons, the release of people imprisoned for over 30 years have been preventing on the grounds that they "do not abandon their thoughts". The Indian reactionary state has locked more than ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent popular war. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has still not been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of the oppressed peoples of different parts of the world spent decades in prison. The fear of ruling classes with regard to communist and revolutionary prisoners and class hatred they feel about them are such that they ruthlessly prevent the Communists and the revolutionaries from leaving prisons while they hold them in violation obvious of their own laws. The assassination of President Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years of isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures have not been taken, is very important to understand the 'Amptiness of fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the dominant system. Managers of the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle to the danger of their lives by going to the limits of the conditions of detention. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against <br/><br/> The prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside, we must support their struggle in the conditions of imprisonment as an integral part of the class struggle outside. Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor! To support the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle! Let us make ours the resistance and the struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

  The cover -up operation of the Tempe crime proceeds unstoppable, and let's constantly come out of the new and nigger sides of it.
  <br>
<br/>
  The House Inquiry Committee did not adhere to the pretexts. The government majority, from the first day, showed that its intention was to direct the decision to the human error or any other convenient justification would extract oil itself and its regional governors.
  <br/>
<br/>
  This has already been apparent by decisions on a one -party bureau by the ND and the list of witnesses, who were finally 35, out of the more than 100 previously agreed by the parties. Among those cut were Hellenic Train workers, who had repeatedly made complaints about the shortcomings of the rail network and had highlighted the risk of accident, as well as firefighters who attempted and could deposit the material that caused the fire that caused the fire . Also, the prosecutors' experts were cut, so the only experts to submit were those of the Committee of Gerapetritis.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Then, the "glorious moments" of the committee were Hatzidakis' lies that there was a teleikos system in Larissa, the open insult of the dead driver, with the violation of his medical privacy, to prove that he should not be in that position for reasons. Health, the marathon deposition of the Italian Captain, Managing Director of Hellenictrain, who argued that everything was working well and was unanimously referred to falsehood!
  <br/>
<br/>
  The issue of the cargo cargo was not given, as in the famous incomplete contract 717, for which Karamanlis said in his deposition that he would not save nothing, since the Rules of Procedure was violated that night! And the Buyer, refused to testify, exercising his right to stumble, since he was now accused of the case.
  <br/>
<br/>
  In the end, the committee was submitted to the case, but a few days later, PASOK MPs who participated in it pointed out that only sections of the case file were given and requested that the whole were lodged.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Summary procedures, the liability of political persons, an attempt to find scapegoats to calm down victims' relatives and all angry society. These were the government's goals in the committee. Even SYRIZA's responsibilities have been put aside (eg about how much its 717 works, which had been signed since 2014), not only because when the accident happened, the ND had been ruled for four years, but because if it enters And SYRIZA in the frame, then the responsibilities begin and become timeless and do not concern governments, but the system they serve. Obviously we did not expect a House committee to even let this be implied.
  <br/>
<br/>
  However, the waters shook the European Parliament's resolution on the delay of awarding justice in Greece, which explicitly refers to the Tempe case. The reasons that led to this should be sought in the more general pressures of Europeans over the Greek government, which has tightened the US, rather than the ... sense of justice of Europeans, who know very well the Italians who bought and operate the Greek railways …
  <br/>
<br/>
  In this resolution, but also in the pressure exerted on the government, the families of the victims, but also the whole people behind them, should also seek the causes of the "awakening" of the Supreme Court, who in late February asked them Prosecutors should take all the necessary steps to clarify the case. In order not to be doubtful about the intentions of the Supreme Court, let us remind you that the Supreme Court prosecutor Georgia Picilin had given… monumental answers to protesting relatives, only weeks earlier: “How do you do? It's a small moral issue "," they happen "," visit a church to help you "!
  <br/>
<br/>
  The hook was also expressed ... materials, with the accident of the accident area, just a day after the accident, on March 1, 2023. The otherwise cumbersome public moved, found contractors, signed contracts, spoiled about 650,000 euros and completed. The project in less than a week! The Journal of Editors revealed that one of the companies involved was set up a month later, in early April!
  <br/>
<br/>
  However, is it still unclear who ordered the mandate, the Region of Thessaly, the Fire Brigade, the Police, the Government? Everyone deny it! But the joke was done. And the official excuse (who was not even convinced of a high school student ...) was that the muddy space had to be cleaned and covered so that the cranes could be stable and the dead would be restored, while also protected the underground conductor of physicist. Gas! What had to be covered was the valuable elements that might be hiding at the scene of the crime and what had to be protected was all kinds of responsible, especially on the ... tall floors! Even if this meant to cover the biological material of the victims ...
  <br/>
<br/>
  The cover -up business is overall, coordinated and inhumane. Those who designed and implemented her are determined to continue to the end. An end to which some guilty and many innocent are intended to find. Above all, to acquit the system that kills, in Mandra, in Mati, in Tempi, but also in Gaza and the camps of the destitute throughout the Earth.
  <br/>
<br/>
  This system was targeted, even without realizing it, by the thousands that were demonstrating last year, the thousands that demonstrated this year on 28 February and many of those who signed the Karystianos resolution. This rage, expressed so massively, must become more overall, turning to the main culprit, the system of exploitation and not be the subject of small -party exploitation of some who, in fact, are complicit.

   On April 6, the rectoral period of the University of Antioquia ends, and with it one of the most disastrous and mercantilizing administrations of education that has had the Udea, the lousy rectory of John Jairo Arboleda, who has the impudence of launching again to reelection, whose electronic consultation will be held this Tuesday, March 12 between 8am and 6pm. The panorama presented to the student body and the university community in general is quite bleak, the candidates let us see who are the ones who really dispute the rectory of the Udea: on the one hand, the Antioquia bourgeoisie of the Antioquia business group
   <strong>
    (GEA)
   </strong>
   and his governor on duty, Uribista Andrés Julián Rendón; And on the other hand, the petrist bureaucracy with candidates close to the historical pact and the corrupt Daniel Quintero.
  </p>
<pstrong>
   “
   <em>
    represents what we want for the government
   </em>
   ”
   .
   <p>
    Among other candidates kneeling to the Business of Antioquia is Ramón Javier Mesa, who was Vice Chancellor of Arboleda, that is, directly responsible for the administrative disaster and the scandalous budget deficit of 345 billion pesos that the Udea has, who also holds known relations with the GEA and with institutional right -wing political sectors. Also, and the most reactionary, is Manuel Santiago Mejía, a member of the GEA, owner of the Colombian of Commerce (corvette) that agglomera companies such as AKT motorcycles, Alkosto and Ktronix stores, and former member of the board of directors of the Public Companies of Medellín, Route N and Metro; Who was the Finance Manager "
    <em>
     La Carolina
    </em>
    ”Where the paramilitary group was founded
    <em>
     The twelve apostles
    </em>
<p>
     The influence of the historical pact, the main coalition of government of the country, also has chips and is not far behind, in a kind of measurement of forces with business and political sectors of Antioquia that represent the legacy of Uribismo, have as spears in different currents to Luquegi Gil, who was general secretary of the Udea and Vice Dean and Dean of the Faculty of Law and Political Science during previous administrations such as Uribe Correa, Alviar and Arboleda; And also Javier Darío Ledesma, specifically record of the disastrous former mayor of Medellín Daniel Quintero (who directly ordered the violent and brutal remembered intervention of the Esmad at the University of Antioquia on February 22, 2020), in addition to former manager and manager in EPM and EPM and Route N.
    </p>
<p>
     Other candidates such as Jaime Andrés Cano or Lina María Muñoz do not represent more than a recycling and verbiage of several past administrations, having occupied charges on several levels previously in the Udea and other IES.
    </p>
<p>
     So, as a student I call to be constantly aware of the administrative and financial reality of the University, as well as the political ties of those who direct it, also not to participate in the false university democracy that is nothing more than a competition in the That those candidates of the Antioquia bourgeoisie and the petrist bureaucracy measure forces.

<strong>
   The incident on March 8 in Oslo, where a pro-Israeli group was prevented from participating in the March 8 train, has received attention in Israeli and international media.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Norwegian Christian-Zionist newspapers and websites have also paid a great deal of attention. The media coverage and statements from the Zionists who visited on March 8 in Oslo clearly show that the action was a provocation.
 </p>
<p>
  The fighting committee in Oslo has written about how activists blocked the Zionists and succeeded in preventing them from participating in the March 8 train. The organizers of the train subsequently said that the provocation was undesirable, partly because they wore passwords with Israeli symbols. The provocators tried to proceed to turn the focus away from the ongoing genocide, where Israel has murdered more than 30,000 people, and legitimizing the genocide by repeating Israel's war propaganda against the Palestinian resistance struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  The Jerusalem Post repeats the police's biased statements that it was "sad for the police to see that women's rights are not ivect, no matter who one belongs to" and refer to the incident as "anti -Semitism". Israeli Yet repeats the claims and also uses the topic "Anti -Semitism". Also, Times of Israel has covered the case in the same way, spreading false claims that the Zionists were subjected to violence and curse.
 </p>
<p>
  The Norwegian racist website Document.no writes that on March 8 in Oslo, "raped Israeli women were unwanted". Document, and many other media, also mentions an event in Sandefjord. Here, provocateurs who showed up with Israeli flags on March 8 were confronted and stopped. The Zionist flag was seized and lit by masses.
 </p>
<p>
  Christian-Zionist newspaper Norway today writes about March 8 in Oslo: "Women who support Israel were not allowed to participate". The Christian-Zionist newspaper Dagen writes: "Jewish March 8 participants were met with slogans: 'Children's Murderers' and' Pests'. ' The Zionists also claim that they were called "whores" during the confrontation. Movies from the incident, on the other hand, show that the slogans that were called were quite common slogans in support of Palestine and against Zionism, and activists present assured that the provokeers were neither called "pests" nor "whores" - this is another lie that has For the purpose of blackening the solidarity with Palestine.
 </p>
<p>
  The Zionists consistently try to resist Israel as "anti -Semitism". In this way, they play a dangerous game where they equate Jews and Zionists. This is a mockery of hundreds of thousands of anti -Sionist Jews worldwide. The provocateur group also consisted of Israelis and non-Jewish Zionists, and it was the group itself that attacked others physically and agreed to disturb the March 8 event in Oslo.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   The Zionists see how the masses all over the world, even in Norway, condemn Israel and rise to protest against the genocide. Thus, they resort to desperate tools to consolidate their supporters, especially among Christian Zionists and Israeli citizens of the United States and Europe. At the same time as these powers pay tribute to the IDF killers and waving the Israeli flag, children starve to death in Gaza and the bombs count on the small strip of land. The episode on March 8 in Oslo is probably an expression of the Zionists losing because Israel will never have peace, as long as they continue the occupation and oppression.

  The head of the Human Rights Folder, Silvio Almeida, accepted the order of Luiz Inacio to cancel the condemnatory events of the government compared to the 60th anniversary of the military coup. Last year, the folder held a series of critical events to the regime, which will no longer be done this year. In addition to Silvio Almeida, other ministers were also directly and personally oriented by Luiz Inacio not to hold such events, according to Folha de São Paulo.
 </p>
<p>
  The event of the Ministry of Human Rights would take place on April 1 at the Museum of the Republic, and would have a speech by Silvio Almeida himself. According to information from the Folha Press Monopoly, the act would seek to extol "the struggle of militants persecuted by the regime."
 </p>
<p>
  Days before Luiz Inacio's order to the ministers, the federal government agent had already widened that he would seek to avoid the matter. "I, honestly, I will deal with as quietly as possible," he said, before stating that "this [the regime] is already part of the past" and that he did not want to be "always brooding", in a set of statements vehemently rejected by A wide range of progressive and democratic activists.

 </p>
<p>
  This is not the first time that Silvio Almeida has acted orders from Luiz Inacio so as not to generate friction with the reactionary armed forces. Last year, Almeida's portfolio had the decree to reopen the special committee on the dead and missing politicians in hand, but did not refer the measure by guidance of the presidential team.
 </p>
<p>
  While the government gives up any movement to condemn the 60th anniversary of the military regime, it was announced today that the Military Club will hold a lunch to celebrate the date on March 27 at the Lagoa Sports headquarters, in the area southern river.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Break the story’ of living crimes and coup
 </h4>
<p>
  With the submission assumed to the barracks, Luiz Inacio will achieve nothing but feed the coup today. Although the military who were involved in an attempt to culminate the institutional rupture in 2022 being investigated, the other loud-command green they knew of the whole contract, but did nothing, follow unpunished, as former commander Freire Gomes. They follow the same way despite all the illegal interference, in the national political life that has been expanded since 2015, and continues to perform these days, such as the current commander Tomás Miguel Miné Paiva.
 </p>
<p>
  Avoid “brooding on history”, therefore, is actually choosing the way of appeasing with today's coup. Maintain the old tradition of the country, already at the level of general law of Brazilian history, of alternation between military and civil governments protected by the barracks, without any confrontation to the coup and crimes of the military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  The aforementioned interviewees defend similar points. “I think it is a very important perception the role of memory. Unlike what some have been talking about, memory has nothing to do with the past. If we do not resolve to our authoritarian past, authoritarianism will be knocking on our door all the time, and we lived it in the very recent history of our country, ”said Professor Ana Paula Goulart Ribeiro in an interview with

  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The same is true of the crimes of the military who follow alive. On March 20, 21 and 22 and April 2, the Amnesty Commission will judge different regime processes. Two of them are collective reparation processes for indigenous peoples Krenak and Guyraroka, brutally affected by the fascist military dictatorship.
 </p>
<p>
  In times of appeasement so severe with the military and such wide impunity to the military for yesterday and today's crimes, as proven in the judgments of cases such as the 257 shots fired at a black family, which occurred in 2019, or forced disappearance From Luiz Eduardo Merlino, from the time of the regime, it is difficult to expect a hard penalty. It is already clear which rule to follow.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  International Walking, National Submission
 </h4>
<p>
  The hypocrisy of the government has been openly open in the international level. Six months ago, the government sent a commission to a political act in Chile of conviction at the 50th anniversary of the military coup. In a similar period, Luiz Inacio visited the mothers of Praça de Maio, also in a political maneuver.
 </p>
<p>
  Here in the country, silence orders the regime, refuses to open commissions for the crimes of the barracks and even avoids receiving relatives from the victims of the facist military dictatorship.
 </p>
<p>
  It remains the doubt of what more can be given to the military as part of the appeasement. Last year, Luiz Inácio accepted the protection of the barracks on procedures such as the CPMI of 8/1 closed -mouth and filled the dacked people with reactionary military personnel for fear of having his government defenered. This year, he threw away all his speech of "dictatorship never again", propagated in the campaign months, also for cowardice. What more Luiz Inacio and his team are willing to accept to keep the well -known cemetery peace?
 </p>

   Also read: and summons political act to April 25: ‘Neither forget nor appease: condemn the blow yesterday and today’ ’
  </a>
</p>
<p>
  It is the lesson that the fight against the crimes of the military of yesterday and today, among which is the veiled or wide -open coup, will be a task for the popular masses in struggle.

  In a state of emergency since March 9, Haiti is now being governed by a “presidential transition council” following the resignation of Prime Minister Ariel Heny. Henry, who was in Kenya's capital trying to close an agreement for a UN mission, failed to return to the country after successive actions promoted by paramilitary organizations.
 </p>
<p>
  Among the main actions of the armed groups is a joint attack on a prison that resulted in the release of 4,000 Haitian prisoners and an attempt to control the international airport that was very close. The union between different paramilitary groups is the result of a call made by Jimmy “Barbecue” Charzier. He went public to cry out for the end of the struggles between the armed groups to overthrow the Prime Minister. The newly instituted “Council” is expected to be defeated by the actions of these paramilitary organizations, which are supplied with weapons from the United States, especially from Florida. They are point 50 machine guns, rifles, snipers and even drones.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, the people continue to face the consequences of reactionary violence, now widespread after centuries of imperialist interference with the Haitian nation. According to doctors without borders, in the largest slum in the country - Cite Soleil - death rates are comparable to those of Syria. The organization of Yankee imperialism and mainly guilty for the current situation, UN, said the nation's health system is “close to collapse”, with scarcity of personnel, equipment, beds, medicines and blood to treat bullet injured patients.
 </p>
<p>
  In Brazil, Luiz Inácio stated that “it is necessary to act quickly in Haiti”, without clarifying what kind of action is talking - last September,

  </a>
  that the Bope of RJ will participate in the joint action headed by Kenya. Antony Blinken, in turn, talked to the Kenyian president about the Haiti crisis. Both underscored a commitment to a multinational security mission to “restore order”. It will be the beginning of a third foreign intervention. On the second of them, conducted for 12 years (2005 to 2017) by Brazilian generals such as Augusto Heleno, which was seen was military operations conducted in the objective of promoting massacres and exterminations. All this experience was used in

  Petrobras shareholders have threatened the company with the requirement of payment of extraordinary dividends, a specific type of dividend (profit paid to shareholders of a company) paid by the state under specific conditions. The Petrobras Engineers Association (AEPET) has denounced that the payment of required dividends can “compromise the future result” and that the current company's shareholder remuneration policy is “unsustainable”.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  What happened?
 </h4>
<p>
  Last week, the Petrobras board announced that it would not pay the extraordinary dividends to shareholders, but would normally make the payment of minimum dividends. The payment was made in the amount of R $ 14.2 billion.
 </p>
<p>
  Even so, the tycoons who live from the dividends have risen against the board in a leech riot. Shareholders threatened to sell their shares as a way to press the company's summit, and the state -owned company lost R $ 55.3 billion in the fictitious “market value” (based on the total sum of the company's common shares).
 </p>
<p>
  The government, being the company's largest shareholder, was also attacked by the Magnatas and its representatives in the “intervention in the company” press monopoly, especially after denying a half-term proposal from Petrobras's board of directors to pay half of the extraordinary dividends .
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Future Harmful’
 </h4>
<p>
  In this scenario, Petrobras engineers organized at AEPET denounced the current compensation policy of shareholders and the possible consequences of the payment of dividends to leeches.
 </p>
<p>
  In article entitled “
  <a href="https://aepet.org.br/artigo/direcao-da-petrobras-mantem-investimentos-baixos-e-dividendos-insustentavelmente-altos-em-2023/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Petrobras direction maintains low investments and unsustainably high dividends by 2023
  </a>
  ”, AEPET President Felipe Coutinho explained that the dividends paid are currently far above the company's investments. This is only possible because of the investments of the past, not the current ones.
 </p>
<p>
  “In 2021 and 2022 the average ratio between paid dividends and net investment was 804%, in the consolidated result of 2023 was 232.63%, while between 2005 and 2020 it was 12.7%, in average terms. That is, the relationship between dividend payment and net investment in 2023 was 18 times higher compared to the average from 2005 to 2020, ”explains Coutinho. He concludes: “It is evident that raising the distribution of dividends over investments will compromise the future result.”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Unsustainable dividends’
 </h4>
<p>
  For Coutinho, there is a problem in the shareholders' own compensation policy. Petrobras is the integrated oil company that most pays dividends to shareholders worldwide, and this is kept in times of low revenue.
 </p>
<p>
  “The relationship between paid dividends and liquid investments demonstrates, in a fullest way, how the policies of Petrobras' high direction are discrepant in relation to the management of large world oil companies. Petrobras' relationship was 4.2 times higher than the average oil officer, ”he says.
 </p>
<p>
  This remuneration policy designed to grant vampires of the nation, survivors of income resulting from the exploitation of national wealth for foreign interests, leads to an unsustainable framework in the company.
 </p>
<p>
  The measure is so severe that it can even compromise reserves replacement, maintenance of production and add value to Petrobras oil value. This is because it is only possible to maintain such a high payment of dividends with the very reduction in investments in activities such as oil production.
 </p>
<p>
  “In analyzing the history of Petrobras and the results of large international oil companies, it is evident that dividends that have been paid by the state's high direction since 2021 are performed to the detriment of liquid investments and, therefore, among other factors, are unsustainable . Under the direction of the Lula administration and the management of Prates, nothing has changed so far, ”concludes Coutinho.

   14th of February:

<br>
  According to media reports from the Indian news agency "The Print", alleged Maoists in the district of Narayanpur in the state of Chhattisgarh killed a man because he was said to have been an informant of the police.

<br>
  In the Indian state of Odisha in the Boudh district, there was an explosion of a land mine in which two security forces were seriously injured. The two injuries were part of an anti-Maoist search operation of the so-called "special operational group" in the Nalikumpha-Wald. The two fighters of this reactionary elite unit were injured on the head and eyes and had to be evacuated using air transport.

    In the West Singhbhum district in the state of Jharkhand, a police informant was liquidated by revolutionary.

<br>
   Exactly one week after a commander of the "armed forces of Chhattisgarh" with an ax, there was once again a fatal attack on a member of the "armed forces of Chhattisgarh" by the revolutionary guerrillas in the Bijapur district. This time it hit a main tread of the 19th battalion of the paramilitary police unit as it should secure a main street in an antimaoist exploration campaign as part of a reconnaissance unit to keep the rest of the reactionary troop from possible back. However, the main tread on the street came up with an explosive device and was killed by the subsequent explosion on the spot. In this case, too, it should be emphasized that the explosive device was placed near the police agent of the 19th battalion.
  </br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   This allows the conclusion that, even if the media of the Indian large bourgeoisie and large landowners would like to suggest other, the reactionary paramilitary units in the Bijapur district and elsewhere are not those that have the initiative in hand and carry out operations from their camps which the revolutionaries put under pressure. Rather, it seems, so that the units of the old Indian state as soon as they open a warehouse are in a defensive and defensive spiral and if the warehouse is left, risk of running and falling the guerrillas immediately.
   <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caf-jawan-killed-ied-blast-chhattisgarh-9181558/">
    And a spokesman for the unit also confirmed in an interview that the Bechapal policätagen, which has existed for a year

<p style="text-align: justify;">
   The development in Bijapur and Chhattisgarh as a whole can be seen on one side the old Indian state The goal pursues the revolutionary base areas, especially in regions such as Bijapur To make the immediate surroundings to smash the new power. On the other hand, the old Indian state does not seem to be able to protect its counter -revolutionary armed forces and maintain the offensive character of the actual mission. Instead, you can see in Bijapur how the initiative is on the side of the revolutionary army under the leadership of the Communist Party of India (Maoistic). Examples of this are among other things in January in Bijapur

    Three members of the paramilitary special unit Cobra in a fire battle in Bijapur February

   this year. The fact that members of the militia are now said to have killed a battalion leader as a relatively inpatient and lower unit confirms that the assessment that the new and red power is consolidated in Bijapur. Overall, there is a picture in which the old armed forces of the Indian state in Bijapur and other regions are more like a vanguard without a main force and are in a backward movement, while the revolutionaries successfully trigger the attempts at attack on the new power and develop strong counter -offensive.

   As it turns out, seasonal improvements in the GDP index and “job creation” are just statistics. It is already from popular wisdom that a government of the exploiting classes lies in two ways: one is even lying, blatantly, the other is publishing statistics that, showing everything, hide what is fundamental. The 3% GDP growth is an artificial number leveraged by the record crop of the agro -export landowner, whose export of its production, for example, do not contribute to taxes; They do not bring any improvement to the economic situation of the majority of the population, that is, the workers, as with the price of the basic basket, which became again in February (in 14 of the 17 capitals, there was high prices). In Rio de Janeiro alone, the increase was on average 5.1%.
  </p>
<p>
   The discharge in rejection was therefore not the result of an alleged reaction to the statement of the country's agent abroad in condemning the Zionist genocide in Gaza. After all, Luiz Inácio only remains to condemn the absurdities in the international level, where his word, at most, causes diplomatic discomfort without important repercussions. (The words of condemnation of Israel, by the way, are always preceded by harsh convictions to the Palestinian National Resistance, choir with the reactionary scream of “Hamas Terrorism”). Already at the national level, Luiz Inacio cannot make their arrice of posing as a “progressive”, as the economy is delivered to the international financial oligarchy and political governance is delivered to the president of fact, the colonel yesterday pocket arthurist Arthur Lira, who, who, In addition to controlling the country's political agenda (controlling what is voted or not voted in the National Congress), it also exercises control over the most important part of the Union budget. It is the government.
  </p>
<p>
   Luiz Inácio can not talk too much about “agribusiness” because it would sound strange, especially after giving him the largest crop in the country's history, far superior to Bolsonaro, while for the “agrarian reform” of the old state , in 2023 and 2024, the shift government allocated R $ 2 billion, the same amount that Bolsonaro had allocated in 2021. We all said that Bolsonaro wanted the death of “agrarian reform”; What do you want to want Luiz Inácio, in addition to your canteenna of prestidigator before the popular masses?
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    The popular masses of the countryside and the city accumulate lessons from this period. To act with dignity, as independent political force, workers need to break free from ideological strings, according to which, they must be content with the minimum. The “minimum”, achieved today through the misleading appeal of saving the country from the hands of a celebrated and supporting a shift government sitting on the right lap and conciliation with the hard core of coup, is condemning them to a future in which the "minimum" will be even worse. This is how the old order continues to deceive the masses, all guaranteed through the well -known blackmail: "Things are not good, that's right, but it is possible, and everything will be even worse if it is not content." Since ancient times, this is the most efficient way to keep slaves submissive. It is also a sign sacred by the story that systems like this no matter what the maneuvers of rulers, will crumble and will be swept!

<p>
  Governors Tarcísio de Freitas (Republicans), of São Paulo (SP), and Ronaldo Caiado (União Brasil), of Goiás (GO), will embark next week for Israel on a trip at the invitation of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The tour will feature an itinerary marked by the Zionist counter-propaganda of recent events in Palestine, including a visit to the place where the Supernova rave took place on October 7. Both sides should also take the opportunity to discuss issues related to agreements between Brazil and Israel, since diplomatic, economic and military relations between the two states remain in force.
 </p>
<p>
  The trip will take place between 18 and 22 March. In addition to the Protionist Freitas and Caiado, the Minas Gerais reactionary governor Romeu Zema (Novo) was invited, but denied the invitation for having other commitments in the period. During the week of travel, the governors will meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 </p>
<p>
  There is no official justification for the visit. According to Brazilian Zionists living in Israel, the visit is to offer a view on the effects of October 7. Already Tarcísio de Freitas listed that the two states have "important partnerships, purchase of equipment" and a "excellent relationship". "We are accepting an invitation and point," he concluded.
 </p>
<p>
  It is quite possible that military agreements are discussed. The Press Monopoly
  <em>
   CNN
  </em>
  He reported that the script may include a visit to an intelligence and strategy center of the Zionist Armed Forces. In recent weeks, Governor Goiano has closed two new agreements with Israel during the inauguration of a pro-action park in Goiás.
 </p>
<p>
  This is possible because, despite the various manifestations of the Brazilian popular masses through Brazil's diplomatic, economic and military breakup with Israel, Luiz Inacio's government insists on the maintenance of relations with the Zionist state.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Ideological visit
 </h4>
<p>
  Cynically, Tarcisio de Freitas declared that the trip will be "without ideology and without politics". The statement is incongruous with the itinerary of the trip itself and the general context of its surroundings.
 </p>
<p>
  On the same day that Caiado signed the agreements with Israel, the governor of Goiás inaugurated a park in honor of the victims of October 7. The pro-Zionist monument made not a single mention of the Palestinians, branded Hamas "terrorist" and ignored reports in the Israeli press itself that many of the civilians were killed by the Israeli military rather than Palestinian fighters.
 </p>
<p>
  In January of this year, Tarcisio also stood out for his proximity to Zionist entities when he attended an event organized by the Congregación Israelita Paulista (CIP). Supposedly held to honor the victims of the Holocaust, the ceremony was marked by political speeches that sought, among other elements, to equate "anti-Semitism" with "anti-Zionism."
 </p>
<p>
  The visit to the Palestinian lands occupied by Israel, therefore, tends to reinforce all relations of Zionism with Brazil, in general, and with the ultra-reactionary agents of Zionism in Brazilian lands, in particular.

March 18 - Solidarity day with political prisoners - Tribute to communist and revolutionary prisoners on March 18 is International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Founded by the Comimintern in 1920, the Red rescue declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the birth of the Paris Commune, "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners was expressed around the world. At each period of history, the operating and oppression systems in which we have lived for thousands of years have been the subject of great resistance, and the price to be paid was high. The reaction of the dominant classes to each fight against dominant operating systems, against each resistance, was the same: to crush each movement which opposes their existence in order to preserve it and, above all, destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has accumulated against the dominant order, the movement which arises from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right track under a good direction. This is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel anger and the desire to change the people and isolate from the people those who cannot be destroyed. The other dimension of intolerance and the aggression of ruling classes against revolutionary, communist and democratic popular movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and repressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will make you the same <br/><br/>  thing "." The philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways, what matters is to transform it. ", Said Karl Marx, the great master of the proletariat. Communists and revolutionaries are fighting for realization From this ideal, they are murdered for this, they are imprisoned for this. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown many times in torture and prisons that as long as continuous life, large examples can be created for prosecution of the class struggle in all the circumstances of life. This path requires taking these risks and it is with this awareness that the Communists and the revolutionaries fight against the operating systems in place. The body of each communist and revolutionary Assassinated, each time spent in prison also laid the foundations for the construction of the Future Society. The bourgeoisie and its lacqua want to guarantee capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered in prisons under the most oppressive conditions. The communist and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to transform the prisons, where the enemy feels the strongest, into a class of class struggle. This is why we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis of their justice and support them. Communists and revolutionaries are not only murdered, imprisoned and tortured because they have alternative ideas with existing operating systems, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is above all an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable classes. Since the objective conditions of the imperialist system keep constant and current the contradiction between the oppressor and the oppressed, the assassination and the imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries do not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the worsening of contradictions are reflected directly in class contradictions and the void left by the revolutionaries and the murdered and imprisoned communists is filled by new people. Insofar as the contradictions of the steering system deepens themselves and its dead ends are increasing, insofar as their fear of the "gravedigger" increases, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their real character more and more concretely . At the same time, the crisis of the system which is deepened and does not resolve leads to the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting of all kinds to centralize more the mechanism of the sovereign state, both with its laws and with its factual organizations , and to put more forward the mechanisms of oppression. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which qualify as "ideal democracies" and "progressive", the successive laws on security, the new laws extending the powers of the state's repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left aside The possibility of carrying the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie restores her position against the working class, the oppressed workers and the oppressed peoples with all her reactionism. In the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, the forms <br/><br/> Government parliamentarians and extra-parliamentary with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual regimes. In these countries, all opponents, starting with the communists and the revolutionaries, are subject to a systematic and permanent terror of state. The depth of the contradiction between the dominant classes and the oppressed peoples in these countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, which can only maintain submission to imperialism by a regime of overwhelming terror against the people, the terror of state is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are just a cover for fascism, reaction and state terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The ruling classes of Turkey, India, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, Israel, etc. Strengthen isolation in all possible forms in order to hold prisoners in prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many sick prisoners are abandoned and assaults against prisoners are repeated. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are imprisoned as a price for the Kurdish national liberation struggle. In Turkish prisons, the release of people imprisoned for over 30 years have been preventing on the grounds that they "do not abandon their thoughts". The Indian reactionary state has locked more than ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent popular war. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has still not been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of the oppressed peoples of different parts of the world spent decades in prison. The fear of ruling classes with regard to communist and revolutionary prisoners and class hatred they feel about them are such that they ruthlessly prevent the Communists and the revolutionaries from leaving prisons while they hold them in violation obvious of their own laws. The assassination of President Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years of isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures have not been taken, is very important to understand the 'Amptiness of fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the dominant system. Managers of the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle to the danger of their lives by going to the limits of the conditions of detention. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against <br/><br/> The prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside, we must support their struggle in the conditions of imprisonment as an integral part of the class struggle outside. Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor! To support the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle! Let us make ours the resistance and the struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

   Today the Indian Supreme Court
  </a>
  has pointed out that “the police have not been in charge of the situation for the last two months” and has stated that “no law and order has been maintained by them”. One more proof of what is already known: the old Indian State is still unable to suppress the protest and attacks against it in Manipur.
 </p>
<p>
  So far there are some official figures given by the Manipur government: by the end of February
  <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/manipur/13264-structures-destroyed-in-manipur-violence-cm-biren-singh-2916584">
   there were 13,264 structures/buildings destroyed
  </a>
  , a figure that continues to be updated and is increasing;
  <a href="https://www.uniindia.com/~/1-87-lakh-people-detained-10000-firs-filed-to-control-manipur-crisis-governor/States/news/3152444.html">
   more than 187,000 arrests have been made
  </a>
  , 10,000 judicial cases have been opened against those who have rebelled against the old Indian authorities. Also since the end of February repressive forces have expressed continuously how they are not able to put Manipur under their control, and they are also unable to put an end to the armed struggle there.
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/19/more-armed-clashes-in-multiple-districts-of-manipur/">
   We have recently reported
  </a>
  on new armed clashes.
 </p>
<p>
  This situation has continued developing, without improving or being solved by the Indian authorities. Between the end of February and the beginning of this month there were several very significant events: on Wednesday the 27
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of February, armed groups
  <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/fierce-gunfight-near-senior-cop-m-amit-singh-house-in-manipurs-imphal-army-called-in-5138990">
   shot the residence of a high ranking police officer
  </a>
  in the capital of Manipur, Imphal. Then
  <a href="https://scroll.in/latest/1064395/manipur-senior-police-officer-abducted-by-meitei-armed-group-rescued-later">
   they took him captive
  </a>
  . The attack was carried out by around 200 armed people. The Manipur Police commandos refused to exercise their functions that day, showing the total crisis in the area for the repressive forces. On last Friday
  <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/army-officer-kidnapped-from-manipur-home-say-sources-in-4th-such-incident-since-may-2023-violence-5200329">
   a new similar incident occurred,
  </a>
  in this case a soldier was captured, being the fourth similar case since May 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  The Manipur government is unable to deal with the situation and it
  <a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/manipur-police-halts-movement-of-transferred-personnel-in-view-of-current-crisis/cid/2002648">
   has even canceled police personnel transfers
  </a>
  from some parts of Manipur to other parts, because in that case it could not guarantee the little control it has over some districts. In turn,
  <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/manipur/manipur-police-warns-action-against-radical-group-says-need-to-deploy-army-enhanced-2916138">
   the Manipur police has made a call for help
  </a>
  to the Indian army and other central repressive forces, stating that their needs have grown in Manipur, and that they must be deployed with greater force. After that, it has been pointed out that joint operations between several repressive forces are performed intensely, but local repressive forces are asking for more central efforts.
 </p>
<p>
  This will without doubt lead to the reactionaries and local ruling classes wanting to apply a harsher repressive policy against the people of Manipur and against any protest, which will be labeled as criminal or violent. In fact, lawyers and activists of Manipur are denouncing that this is happening already, for example with the
  <a href="https://www.imphaltimes.com/news/lawyers-condemn-security-forces-excess-inside-chierap-court-complex-staged-sit-in-protest/">
   excess of force used by the Rapid Action Force
  </a>
  against the frequent and peaceful protests of women which take place in Manipur. All of this is nothing more than the result of the sharp crisis of the local ruling classes, and because of the explosiveness of the masses, materialized in the great protests that have shaken Manipur since May of 2023. And these protests have not been pacified at all, on the contrary, they continue to show week after week, month after month, the weakness of the old Indian State as well as its reactionary character.

March 18 - Solidarity day with political prisoners - Tribute to communist and revolutionary prisoners on March 18 is International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Founded by the Comimintern in 1920, the Red rescue declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the birth of the Paris Commune, "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners was expressed around the world. At each period of history, the operating and oppression systems in which we have lived for thousands of years have been the subject of great resistance, and the price to be paid was high. The reaction of the dominant classes to each fight against dominant operating systems, against each resistance, was the same: to crush each movement which opposes their existence in order to preserve it and, above all, destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has accumulated against the dominant order, the movement which arises from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right track under a good direction. This is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel anger and the desire to change the people and isolate from the people those who cannot be destroyed. The other dimension of intolerance and the aggression of ruling classes against revolutionary, communist and democratic popular movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and repressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will make you the same <br/><br/>  thing "." The philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways, what matters is to transform it. ", Said Karl Marx, the great master of the proletariat. Communists and revolutionaries are fighting for realization From this ideal, they are murdered for this, they are imprisoned for this. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown many times in torture and prisons that as long as continuous life, large examples can be created for prosecution of the class struggle in all the circumstances of life. This path requires taking these risks and it is with this awareness that the Communists and the revolutionaries fight against the operating systems in place. The body of each communist and revolutionary Assassinated, each time spent in prison also laid the foundations for the construction of the Future Society. The bourgeoisie and its lacqua want to guarantee capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered in prisons under the most oppressive conditions. The communist and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to transform the prisons, where the enemy feels the strongest, into a class of class struggle. This is why we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis of their justice and support them. Communists and revolutionaries are not only murdered, imprisoned and tortured because they have alternative ideas with existing operating systems, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is above all an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable classes. Since the objective conditions of the imperialist system keep constant and current the contradiction between the oppressor and the oppressed, the assassination and the imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries do not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the worsening of contradictions are reflected directly in class contradictions and the void left by the revolutionaries and the murdered and imprisoned communists is filled by new people. Insofar as the contradictions of the steering system deepens themselves and its dead ends are increasing, insofar as their fear of the "gravedigger" increases, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their real character more and more concretely . At the same time, the crisis of the system which is deepened and does not resolve leads to the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting of all kinds to centralize more the mechanism of the sovereign state, both with its laws and with its factual organizations , and to put more forward the mechanisms of oppression. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which qualify as "ideal democracies" and "progressive", the successive laws on security, the new laws extending the powers of the state's repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left aside The possibility of carrying the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie restores her position against the working class, the oppressed workers and the oppressed peoples with all her reactionism. In the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, the forms <br/><br/> Government parliamentarians and extra-parliamentary with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual regimes. In these countries, all opponents, starting with the communists and the revolutionaries, are subject to a systematic and permanent terror of state. The depth of the contradiction between the dominant classes and the oppressed peoples in these countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, which can only maintain submission to imperialism by a regime of overwhelming terror against the people, the terror of state is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are just a cover for fascism, reaction and state terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The ruling classes of Turkey, India, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, Israel, etc. Strengthen isolation in all possible forms in order to hold prisoners in prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many sick prisoners are abandoned and assaults against prisoners are repeated. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are imprisoned as a price for the Kurdish national liberation struggle. In Turkish prisons, the release of people imprisoned for over 30 years have been preventing on the grounds that they "do not abandon their thoughts". The Indian reactionary state has locked more than ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent popular war. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has still not been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of the oppressed peoples of different parts of the world spent decades in prison. The fear of ruling classes with regard to communist and revolutionary prisoners and class hatred they feel about them are such that they ruthlessly prevent the Communists and the revolutionaries from leaving prisons while they hold them in violation obvious of their own laws. The assassination of President Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years of isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures have not been taken, is very important to understand the 'Amptiness of fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the dominant system. Managers of the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle to the danger of their lives by going to the limits of the conditions of detention. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against <br/><br/> The prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside, we must support their struggle in the conditions of imprisonment as an integral part of the class struggle outside. Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor! To support the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle! Let us make ours the resistance and the struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

  On March 8, the International Women’s Day of Struggle, demonstrations and rallies also took place in Austria in various cities. Here we would like to report on the actions in Vienna and Linz and give a brief overview.

<strong>
   Impressions from Vienna
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  This year there was a rally on Mariahilferstrasse on March 8, organized by the Women’s Center Vienna (FZ), the Red Women’s Committee Vienna and the Frauenhetz. Around 100 people gathered, speeches were made and songs were presented. The speeches dealt with current topics and how these affect women in particular. A large part of the women work in those sectors with lower wages and around half of them part -time. This makes them particularly hit hard by the inflation of the past few years, as well as the wage cuts as a result of the poor KV collective agreements. In this context, the increase of the retirement age of women was also criticized. This increase was planned in the 1990s and should be implemented “if the full gender equality has been achieved”. “Equality” is not a reality today, but the increase in the age of retirement is very well!
 </p>
<p>
  The speakers of the rally also opposed the increasing militarization and armament and explained the need to organize themselves for the struggle. In addition, important revolutionary movements in the world – such as in India, Peru, Turkey and on the Philippines – were held up and emphasized that numerous women are at the forefront in fights like this. The speakers also criticized the introduction of the parent-child passport, since its lack of data protection enables social insurance to read, among other things, the number of abortions a woman had.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, it was spoken about the situation of the FZ in Vienna (we

   reported
  </a>
  : FZ remains! – The struggle for the oldest self-managed autonomous women’s center in Europe continues!) and the city of Vienna’s repression was denounced. Leaflets of the “Action for Democratic Rights of the People ” (ADRV) were also distributed (March 8, 2024: For a revolutionary women’s movement)
 </p>
<p>
  After the rally, the participants marched to the meeting of the spare-time-pedagogues of “Education at the center” and took part in this.

<strong>
   Demonstration in Linz
  </strong>
</br></p>
<p>
  In Linz, the demonstration on March 8, the International Women’s Day of Struggle, this year was jointly organized by the “Alliance March 8” and “DIY” (“Do It Yourself: Women’s Day”). The march of around 2,500 demonstrators started at the music theater/Volksgarten and moved via the Landstraße to Hauptplatz. The Rote Fahne was also represented with an information table for acquiring the newspaper and accompanied the demonstration.
 </p>
<p>
  Although numerous party-related clubs tried to prevent a combative expression on the demonstration, there were some participants who raised the democratic and revolutionary demands powerfully and combative with their slogans during the march. Among other things, the demands for more childcare and against the closure of women’s shelters were heard here. Furthermore, higher wages, an increase of the unemployment money to 80 percent and the need for a revolutionary women’s movement were content of the slogans raised.
 </p>
<p>
  Some participants rightfully criticized the fact that some parts of the demonstration were more of a “party mood” than combative. This in turn shows the need for a revolutionary women’s movement, the struggle and unity for it!

March 18 - Solidarity day with political prisoners - Tribute to communist and revolutionary prisoners on March 18 is International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Founded by the Comimintern in 1920, the Red rescue declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the birth of the Paris Commune, "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners was expressed around the world. At each period of history, the operating and oppression systems in which we have lived for thousands of years have been the subject of great resistance, and the price to be paid was high. The reaction of the dominant classes to each fight against dominant operating systems, against each resistance, was the same: to crush each movement which opposes their existence in order to preserve it and, above all, destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has accumulated against the dominant order, the movement which arises from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right track under a good direction. This is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel anger and the desire to change the people and isolate from the people those who cannot be destroyed. The other dimension of intolerance and the aggression of ruling classes against revolutionary, communist and democratic popular movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and repressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will make you the same <br/><br/>  thing "." The philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways, what matters is to transform it. ", Said Karl Marx, the great master of the proletariat. Communists and revolutionaries are fighting for realization From this ideal, they are murdered for this, they are imprisoned for this. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown many times in torture and prisons that as long as continuous life, large examples can be created for prosecution of the class struggle in all the circumstances of life. This path requires taking these risks and it is with this awareness that the Communists and the revolutionaries fight against the operating systems in place. The body of each communist and revolutionary Assassinated, each time spent in prison also laid the foundations for the construction of the Future Society. The bourgeoisie and its lacqua want to guarantee capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered in prisons under the most oppressive conditions. The communist and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to transform the prisons, where the enemy feels the strongest, into a class of class struggle. This is why we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis of their justice and support them. Communists and revolutionaries are not only murdered, imprisoned and tortured because they have alternative ideas with existing operating systems, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is above all an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable classes. Since the objective conditions of the imperialist system keep constant and current the contradiction between the oppressor and the oppressed, the assassination and the imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries do not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the worsening of contradictions are reflected directly in class contradictions and the void left by the revolutionaries and the murdered and imprisoned communists is filled by new people. Insofar as the contradictions of the steering system deepens themselves and its dead ends are increasing, insofar as their fear of the "gravedigger" increases, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their real character more and more concretely . At the same time, the crisis of the system which is deepened and does not resolve leads to the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting of all kinds to centralize more the mechanism of the sovereign state, both with its laws and with its factual organizations , and to put more forward the mechanisms of oppression. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which qualify as "ideal democracies" and "progressive", the successive laws on security, the new laws extending the powers of the state's repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left aside The possibility of carrying the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie restores her position against the working class, the oppressed workers and the oppressed peoples with all her reactionism. In the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, the forms <br/><br/> Government parliamentarians and extra-parliamentary with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual regimes. In these countries, all opponents, starting with the communists and the revolutionaries, are subject to a systematic and permanent terror of state. The depth of the contradiction between the dominant classes and the oppressed peoples in these countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, which can only maintain submission to imperialism by a regime of overwhelming terror against the people, the terror of state is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are just a cover for fascism, reaction and state terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The ruling classes of Turkey, India, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, Israel, etc. Strengthen isolation in all possible forms in order to hold prisoners in prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many sick prisoners are abandoned and assaults against prisoners are repeated. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are imprisoned as a price for the Kurdish national liberation struggle. In Turkish prisons, the release of people imprisoned for over 30 years have been preventing on the grounds that they "do not abandon their thoughts". The Indian reactionary state has locked more than ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent popular war. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has still not been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of the oppressed peoples of different parts of the world spent decades in prison. The fear of ruling classes with regard to communist and revolutionary prisoners and class hatred they feel about them are such that they ruthlessly prevent the Communists and the revolutionaries from leaving prisons while they hold them in violation obvious of their own laws. The assassination of President Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years of isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures have not been taken, is very important to understand the 'Amptiness of fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the dominant system. Managers of the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle to the danger of their lives by going to the limits of the conditions of detention. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against <br/><br/> The prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside, we must support their struggle in the conditions of imprisonment as an integral part of the class struggle outside. Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor! To support the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle! Let us make ours the resistance and the struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

  , Denmark, the danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, was invited to hold a speech at an 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March event. When she started her speech, she was immediately condemned by activists from the Palestine Solidarity Network and people from the audience who shouted slogans such as “Mette, stop your hypocrisy!” and “Free free Palestine!”. Banners and Palestinian flags were unfolded from the balconies, and fliers were thrown down. Unable to continue her speech, the prime minister retreated from the event together with other ministers who left because they “felt unsafe”.

March 18 - Solidarity day with political prisoners - Tribute to communist and revolutionary prisoners on March 18 is International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Founded by the Comimintern in 1920, the Red rescue declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the birth of the Paris Commune, "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners was expressed around the world. At each period of history, the operating and oppression systems in which we have lived for thousands of years have been the subject of great resistance, and the price to be paid was high. The reaction of the dominant classes to each fight against dominant operating systems, against each resistance, was the same: to crush each movement which opposes their existence in order to preserve it and, above all, destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has accumulated against the dominant order, the movement which arises from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right track under a good direction. This is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel anger and the desire to change the people and isolate from the people those who cannot be destroyed. The other dimension of intolerance and the aggression of ruling classes against revolutionary, communist and democratic popular movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and repressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will make you the same <br/><br/>  thing "." The philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways, what matters is to transform it. ", Said Karl Marx, the great master of the proletariat. Communists and revolutionaries are fighting for realization From this ideal, they are murdered for this, they are imprisoned for this. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown many times in torture and prisons that as long as continuous life, large examples can be created for prosecution of the class struggle in all the circumstances of life. This path requires taking these risks and it is with this awareness that the Communists and the revolutionaries fight against the operating systems in place. The body of each communist and revolutionary Assassinated, each time spent in prison also laid the foundations for the construction of the Future Society. The bourgeoisie and its lacqua want to guarantee capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered in prisons under the most oppressive conditions. The communist and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to transform the prisons, where the enemy feels the strongest, into a class of class struggle. This is why we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis of their justice and support them. Communists and revolutionaries are not only murdered, imprisoned and tortured because they have alternative ideas with existing operating systems, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is above all an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable classes. Since the objective conditions of the imperialist system keep constant and current the contradiction between the oppressor and the oppressed, the assassination and the imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries do not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the worsening of contradictions are reflected directly in class contradictions and the void left by the revolutionaries and the murdered and imprisoned communists is filled by new people. Insofar as the contradictions of the steering system deepens themselves and its dead ends are increasing, insofar as their fear of the "gravedigger" increases, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their real character more and more concretely . At the same time, the crisis of the system which is deepened and does not resolve leads to the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting of all kinds to centralize more the mechanism of the sovereign state, both with its laws and with its factual organizations , and to put more forward the mechanisms of oppression. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which qualify as "ideal democracies" and "progressive", the successive laws on security, the new laws extending the powers of the state's repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left aside The possibility of carrying the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie restores her position against the working class, the oppressed workers and the oppressed peoples with all her reactionism. In the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, the forms <br/><br/> Government parliamentarians and extra-parliamentary with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual regimes. In these countries, all opponents, starting with the communists and the revolutionaries, are subject to a systematic and permanent terror of state. The depth of the contradiction between the dominant classes and the oppressed peoples in these countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, which can only maintain submission to imperialism by a regime of overwhelming terror against the people, the terror of state is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are just a cover for fascism, reaction and state terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The ruling classes of Turkey, India, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, Israel, etc. Strengthen isolation in all possible forms in order to hold prisoners in prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many sick prisoners are abandoned and assaults against prisoners are repeated. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are imprisoned as a price for the Kurdish national liberation struggle. In Turkish prisons, the release of people imprisoned for over 30 years have been preventing on the grounds that they "do not abandon their thoughts". The Indian reactionary state has locked more than ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent popular war. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has still not been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of the oppressed peoples of different parts of the world spent decades in prison. The fear of ruling classes with regard to communist and revolutionary prisoners and class hatred they feel about them are such that they ruthlessly prevent the Communists and the revolutionaries from leaving prisons while they hold them in violation obvious of their own laws. The assassination of President Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years of isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures have not been taken, is very important to understand the 'Amptiness of fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the dominant system. Managers of the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle to the danger of their lives by going to the limits of the conditions of detention. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against <br/><br/> The prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside, we must support their struggle in the conditions of imprisonment as an integral part of the class struggle outside. Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor! To support the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle! Let us make ours the resistance and the struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

March 18 - Solidarity day with political prisoners - Tribute to communist and revolutionary prisoners on March 18 is International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Founded by the Comimintern in 1920, the Red rescue declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the birth of the Paris Commune, "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity with political prisoners was expressed around the world. At each period of history, the operating and oppression systems in which we have lived for thousands of years have been the subject of great resistance, and the price to be paid was high. The reaction of the dominant classes to each fight against dominant operating systems, against each resistance, was the same: to crush each movement which opposes their existence in order to preserve it and, above all, destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has accumulated against the dominant order, the movement which arises from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right track under a good direction. This is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel anger and the desire to change the people and isolate from the people those who cannot be destroyed. The other dimension of intolerance and the aggression of ruling classes against revolutionary, communist and democratic popular movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and repressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed popular masses: "If you act against us, we will make you the same <br/><br/>  thing "." The philosophers have only interpreted the world in different ways, what matters is to transform it. ", Said Karl Marx, the great master of the proletariat. Communists and revolutionaries are fighting for realization From this ideal, they are murdered for this, they are imprisoned for this. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown many times in torture and prisons that as long as continuous life, large examples can be created for prosecution of the class struggle in all the circumstances of life. This path requires taking these risks and it is with this awareness that the Communists and the revolutionaries fight against the operating systems in place. The body of each communist and revolutionary Assassinated, each time spent in prison also laid the foundations for the construction of the Future Society. The bourgeoisie and its lacqua want to guarantee capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered in prisons under the most oppressive conditions. The communist and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to transform the prisons, where the enemy feels the strongest, into a class of class struggle. This is why we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis of their justice and support them. Communists and revolutionaries are not only murdered, imprisoned and tortured because they have alternative ideas with existing operating systems, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is above all an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable classes. Since the objective conditions of the imperialist system keep constant and current the contradiction between the oppressor and the oppressed, the assassination and the imprisonment of communists and revolutionaries do not solve the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the worsening of contradictions are reflected directly in class contradictions and the void left by the revolutionaries and the murdered and imprisoned communists is filled by new people. Insofar as the contradictions of the steering system deepens themselves and its dead ends are increasing, insofar as their fear of the "gravedigger" increases, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their real character more and more concretely . At the same time, the crisis of the system which is deepened and does not resolve leads to the bourgeoisie and the ruling classes exploiting of all kinds to centralize more the mechanism of the sovereign state, both with its laws and with its factual organizations , and to put more forward the mechanisms of oppression. In the imperialist capitalist countries, which qualify as "ideal democracies" and "progressive", the successive laws on security, the new laws extending the powers of the state's repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left aside The possibility of carrying the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie restores her position against the working class, the oppressed workers and the oppressed peoples with all her reactionism. In the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, the forms <br/><br/> Government parliamentarians and extra-parliamentary with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual regimes. In these countries, all opponents, starting with the communists and the revolutionaries, are subject to a systematic and permanent terror of state. The depth of the contradiction between the dominant classes and the oppressed peoples in these countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, which can only maintain submission to imperialism by a regime of overwhelming terror against the people, the terror of state is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are just a cover for fascism, reaction and state terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The ruling classes of Turkey, India, the Philippines, Peru, Iran, Israel, etc. Strengthen isolation in all possible forms in order to hold prisoners in prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many sick prisoners are abandoned and assaults against prisoners are repeated. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are imprisoned as a price for the Kurdish national liberation struggle. In Turkish prisons, the release of people imprisoned for over 30 years have been preventing on the grounds that they "do not abandon their thoughts". The Indian reactionary state has locked more than ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent popular war. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah was imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has still not been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of the oppressed peoples of different parts of the world spent decades in prison. The fear of ruling classes with regard to communist and revolutionary prisoners and class hatred they feel about them are such that they ruthlessly prevent the Communists and the revolutionaries from leaving prisons while they hold them in violation obvious of their own laws. The assassination of President Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health after 29 years of isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures have not been taken, is very important to understand the 'Amptiness of fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the dominant system. Managers of the death of President Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. Communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle to the danger of their lives by going to the limits of the conditions of detention. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against <br/><br/> The prisoners, to be the voice of prisoners outside, we must support their struggle in the conditions of imprisonment as an integral part of the class struggle outside. Communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor! To support the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle! Let us make ours the resistance and the struggle of communist and revolutionary prisoners. Let us be the voice of the prisoners International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

   The Israeli state continues the genocide against the Palestinian people. As of March 5, at least 31,052 people in Gaza had been killed as a result of the Israeli offensive. At the same time, international solidarity continues with the Palestinian resistance struggle. That's what our comrades write in The Red Herald.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  According to the UN, 360,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed. It makes up more than half of all the homes in Gaza. 132 water wells are damaged or destroyed, and only 11 out of 35 hospitals are in partial operation.
 </p>
<p>
  The Red Herald writes that every hour 15 people are killed, of which 6 children, 35 people are wounded, and 12 buildings are destroyed.
 </p>
<p>
  Along the border between Israel and Lebanon, shooting exchanges are continued between Israeli forces and Hezbollah forces. On March 12, Hezbollah fired around 100 rockets to northern Israel and the Golan heights.
 </p>
<p>
  In the Red Sea, a British cargo ship must have sunk after being shot by forces from Yemen-based Ansar Allah.
 </p>
<p>
  In Brazil, the Revolutionary Front for Defense of People's Rights (FRDP - Brazil) continues to develop its powerful campaign during the slogan "Palestine makes resistance! Palestine will prevail! "

<p>
   After finishing the conference entitled
   <em>
    March 8: Go ahead with the revolutionary female movement
   </em>
   , developed live on March 5 (
   <a href="https://youtu.be/xNgHBA8C2ZY" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank">
    https://youtu.be/xNgHBA8C2ZY
   </a>
   ), I was commented on some opinions expressed by me in that transmission, opinions that raised concerns and some criticism or observations of disagreement.
  </p>
<p>
   Since the program will not have within its next agenda the space to develop them, it has seemed convenient not to let them pass and it is very appropriate to write some lines that I hope to contribute to clear the doubts about my thinking, that it is passing through, does not compromise To the entire group work table group
   <em>
    Workers' avant -garde
   </em>
   , much less to the UOC (MLM).
  </p>
<p>
   On the part of some companions of Peru, they wrote the following:
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    Greet them for yesterday's program, we have a consultation. They could share material or expand on non -class contradictions about women, as mentioned in c. At the end of the event
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   The restlessness is very timely in these days that we have commemorated the
   <em>
    International Women's Day
   </em>
   , which makes the revolutionaries and masses have a favorable disposition to analyze in depth what this date means, and better understand what this commemoration contains. Analyze the female problem, or the problem of women in society, leads us to several ways to analyze it, which allows us to establish the diversity of aspects that can be seen in a phenomenon, call yourself if you want the multilaterality of things, and In that order of ideas we must specify at least the following that I consider very important:
  </p>
<p>
   First. The relationship with the class struggle. There is absolutely nothing in society that is above the class struggle, in the sense that any position that is adopted in the face of any problem in society reflects a position of a certain social class. This is a totally true relationship, arising from the moment in which classes appeared in society as results of the appearance of private property on the means of production, that is, that relationship will only disappear when classes disappear, and that will be in the Communism. Hence, if we talk about the woman's problem, he has been related to the class struggle always, like everything in society.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    Clarified the issue of the relationship with the class struggle, the second that I consider must be specified is that the problem of women is not essentially class, here is perhaps one of the most controversial aspects. Well, let's start from one of the best known MAO formulations and accepted by the communists when studying the issue of contradiction. Mao says:
   </p>
<p>
    «In opposition to the world's metaphysical conception, the world's materialistic dialectical conception argues that, in order to understand the development of a thing, we must study it inside and its relations with other things; In other words, we must consider that the development of things is a car, internal and necessary, and that, in its movement, everything is in interconnection and interaction with the things that surround it. The fundamental cause of the development of things is not external but internal; resides in its internal contradictory character. All things entail this contradictory character; Hence its movement, its development. The internal contradictory nature of a thing is the fundamental cause of its development, while its interconnection and its interaction with other things are secondary causes ».
   </p>
<p p="">
<p>
     This leads us to raise an affirmation that for many produces stinging, is there a problem between men and women, among all men and all women? Definitely yes. This contradiction is so significant and deep that the organizations of the communists are proposed consciously and organized, permanent campaigns to fight against oppression in their own ranks, because only with a strong and permanent reeducation campaign of communist men can be fought the manifestations of oppression on their comrades; Not in vain accusations of machismo are permanently known in the ranks of the communists, subtle or open oppression. And if we look at society, then the manifestations of machismo and oppression are innumerable that every day, all women must endure, just because they are women.
    </p>
<p>
     Here it is appropriate to remember what Mao explains in the "universality of contradiction" and "the particularity of the contradiction":
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      When addressing a given form of the movement of matter, we must take into consideration what it has in common with other forms of movement. But what contains special importance, since it serves as a basis for our knowledge of a thing, is to attend to what this form of the movement of matter has of individual, that is, to which it distinguishes it qualitatively from other forms of movement. Only then can we distinguish one thing from another. All forms of the movement contains its own particular contradiction. This particular contradiction constitutes the particular essence that differentiates a thing from the others. Here is the internal cause or, so to speak, the basis of the infinite variety of things in the world
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p p="">
<p>
      In society there are many contradictions, one of them is that of the woman's problem, and one thing is to analyze the nature of each contradiction and another is to understand what the relationship with the class struggle is like.
     </p>
<p>
      And the third aspect that I want to highlight has to do with the forces that are part of the female struggle, this very important analysis being when understanding an aspect of society and the forces that act; Those that are decisive to be at the forefront, which are considered allied, which are neutralizable and those that are definitely enemies; That is, if we understand that the woman because of the fact of being, she is already in relation to this contradiction, we go on to see the problem from another perspective.
     </p>
<p>
      All, absolutely all women are forces likely to be won for the cause of their emancipation, but of course, not all in equal proportion, because one thing is the workers who in addition to being doubly oppressed are doubly exploited, or the women of the little Bourgeoisie to know how A movement that denounces the ways in which the state or men of their own class oppress them. In this same sense comes the analysis of the other forces, as in the case of the participation of men and of course, very important the participation of classes and therefore, of the men of the working class as the main force within the male sex For the female cause.
     </p>
<p>
      I hope with these lines to have managed to clear the doubts about my position about the female problem and its relationship with the class struggle; To the friends of Peru, my most affectionate revolutionary greeting.
     </p>
<p>
      Finally, to encourage all readers and followers of the workers' revolution to follow our podcasts in the Naravic Vanguardia; That they do not hesitate to express their opinions there, not only do we want “applause committees”, I understand that in a program as a workers' avant -garde various points of view, even aspects of debate between those who are part of the work table, and with Greater reason diverge with opinions of our followers. The space allows everyone to express their thinking, fully trusting that we are united with the search for truth based on Marxist analysis and taking reality as a center.
     </p>
<p>
      Affectionate revolutionary greeting

<p>
  We denounce the Medicine PC, where once again with its attitude it proves that it does not want to massive collective processes and the establishment of student associations in their organs.
 </p>
<p>
  Specifically, after an attempt at the General Assembly on Monday 11/03 that failed to gather quorum, he proposed to be called upon a postponement in eight days (!), While a student demonstration on Thursday against the prefecture of Pierrakakis, for which we would like The Association to make a decision to participate.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, such an attitude does not impress us, as the moods were already shown by her attitude in writing a common framework. The PSC decided to break the frameworks with which we have descended for weeks (racing moves, ESAK and PSC) and to lower its own framework in which not only did it not even propose occupation but not even a demonstration (!!!). How much more clearly to say that he decides to close the struggle he has opened for two months against the law - abortion that crushes the right to studies. How much more submissive and defeatable attitude can he adopt when the moods of the world have emerged from the enormous mass of the nationwide demonstration on the day of the vote, and now sends this world?
 </p>
<p>
  She did not come to whistle for the end of the races, and she is also opening an open sabotage of the efforts of the forces that continue to have racing moods and seek to keep the club in the racing trajectory in which he has entered, putting the prospect of continuing to overthrow him. Thus, he not only voted against our proposal for postponement on Wednesday 13/03 to make a decision and participation in the rally, but refuses to accept the signatures collected as defined by the statutes as an alternative way of calling a meeting.
 </p>
<p>
  More specifically, they invoke the Articles of Association so as not to validate the signatures by saying that they need 300 - when the quorum for GM is 160 people (!). They adopt "two meters and two weights" as for the queries, they claim that the voters' vote of students need 1/10 of all students (!). For this reason, the statutes stipulate in both cases that they relate to the members of the Student Association, which it re -defines as the "cash" members. So, selectively defining what is advantageous to us who are considered members of the Association on a case -by -case basis is but degenerative. Still, their refusal to attend the BoD for ratification of the signatures while their members were in the School confirms that they did what they are going through in order not to thrive in the attempt to thrive.
 </p>
<p>
  The attempt to conceal that they are sabotaging the General Assembly does not pass with ridiculous excuses that bureaucratically invoke the statutes as a shield in their policy in the otherwise choice to close the struggles. Because a force with reference to the struggles cannot put tricks with tricks and tricks if he is really interested in the massive processes. He cannot deal with the efforts of two forces of the club to collect signatures worse and from the DAP which did not even hesitate to challenge the validity of the signatures. However, such an attitude is awaited by forces that have supported the whole of the law and all the policy of the government in the schools and are clearly against student struggles. But when such attitudes stem from forces with reference (theoretically always) to the movement, only hypocritical can be seen by their "concern" to continue the struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  This attitude is only worthy of complaint and must be answered in the following way: by the massive of the General Assembly, with the marginalization of such rationales that "hangs" the struggles and by adopting a racing direction with the prospect of overthrowing the law and continuing. of the races. Submission will not pass, we will defend our struggles through our collective processes against the forces of government youth but also the forces that disorient and frustrate students.

    It turns out that seasonal improvements in the GDP index and 
 "Employment creation" are only statistics. It is already popular wisdom that a 
 Government of the exploiting classes lies in two ways: one is lying 
 made, blatantly, the other is publishing statistics that, by showing it 
 Everything hides the fundamental. The growth of 3% of GDP is a figure 
 artificial leveraged by the record harvest of the agro -export large estate, whose 
 Export of its production, for example, does not contribute to taxes; No 
 They suppose no improvement for the economic situation of most of the 
 population, that is, of the workers, as is the case with the price of the basket 
 Basic food, which became more expensive in February (in 14 of the 17 
 capitals, there was a price increase). Only in Rio de Janeiro, the increase was 
 on average 5.1%.

    Luiz Inacio can't talk too much about 
 "Agrobusiness", because it would sound strange, even more after having delivered the 
 greater safra plan in the history of the country, far superior to Bolsonaro, 
 while, for the “agrarian reform” of the old, in 2023 and 2024, the current 
 Government assigned miserable 2,000 million reais, the same amount as 
 Bolsonaro had allocated in 2021. We all said that Bolsonaro wanted the 
 death of the "agrarian reform"; What does Luiz Inacio want, beyond his 
 CANTAETA AS PRESIDENTIFITOR BEFORE THE POPULAR MASSES?

    There is also little to say about the fragile base 
 institutional that the country lives due to its own inevitable decomposition. 
 The president knows that the peak of the military crisis, in November 2022, no 
 It was only the result of bolsonarism, but of a doctrine rooted in the

 All areas of its structure. . This mentality is that, to conjure a

    The popular, country and city masses accumulate 
 Lessons of this period. To act with dignity, as a political force 
 Independent, workers need to free themselves from limitations 
 ideological, according to which they must be content with the minimum. The "minimum", 
 achieved today through the deceptive call to save the country from the hands of 
 a scoundrel and support for a government sitting in the lap of the right and 
 The conciliation with the hard core of the coup, is condemning them to a future. 
 in which the "minimum" will be even worse. Thus continues to cheat the old order to 
 masses, all guaranteed by the well -known blackmail: “Things are not 
 Well, that sure, but it is possible, and everything will go worse if you do not settle. ” 
 Since ancient times, this has been the most effective way to keep the 
 slaves. It is also a signal confirmed by the story that systems such as 
 This, regardless of the rulers' maneuvers, will collapse and will be 
 sweeps.

 A deafening silence and an unthinkable absence is characterized by this year's 26th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival. Unfortunately, this is not a mere negligence of the lack of readiness of its organizers. It is a glaring option for exclusion for anything that reminds the greatest genocide of the 21st century that is currently being held in Palestine by the Zionist, fascist state of Israel, with the US-NATO-EU contacted.
 <br>
<p>
</p>
<p p="">
<p>
   This is not a random choice. It is directly related to the policy of the current Greek government (but also of the previous ones) to develop close relations with the occupation of Israel and to completely change even this policy of older Greek governments of the Transition against the Palestinian struggle. It is related to its involvement in the war in Ukraine and its mission to the Reds on the side of Westerners and Israel. That is why at a time when the most reactionary and criminal wing of the Zionists in our country are ruled by those who support the Palestinian struggle. It is a clear political choice for the organizers of the festival, and in the city that has experienced and knows how to stigmatize the anthropomic from whatever status they are committed and whatever they do.
  </p>
<p>
   In the face of this challenge, one progressive man of the city, none of the spectators of the festival can remain indifferent. Must disapprove of this unacceptable option. He must protest and even ask for the 26th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival to include in a special screening, even a documentary on the modern Palestine tragedy.

  From the first moment, the case of rape and coercion in the prostitution of the 12 -year -old by Sepolia is not convenient. What else is the dirt and stench is the vulgarity with which, from the beginning, the media have tried to highlight Elias Michou's patriotic and Christian profile while he himself was "when God was not looking" was a brutal rapist and a fan of minor girls! What other than '' strong backs '' and management '' soft '' are his photos with politicians and other prominent rotten devotees!
  <br>
<br>
  Who can forget that Domna Michailidou's "address" of the child '' escaped 'her so that they can threaten and intimidate it in the disclosure of evidence? Who are they afraid of?
  <br>
<br>
  The attempt to blame the 12 -year -old victim and her family from the outset is messing with a concealment! The 12 -year -old's testimonies, the rapists he recognizes and increasingly are growing, the elements that emerge show a large circuit. A large circuit, including high -ranking faces. A circuit that civil justice will do everything to protect!
  <br/>
<br/>
  The heinous prosecution proposes the acquittal of St. Elias Michou for rape due to doubts, for mastics in detention centers and for coercion and porn revenue. For the '' monster mother '', of course, it is proposed to guilty for lashing in the form of unbearable pressures, emotional blackmail and prompts to her minor daughter to be published.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Once again, the revelation of the "law" of civil justice is vomiting! The '' right '' of violence, exploitation, oppression, defense of the social middle ages, legalization of each side of our lives once again triumphs!
  <br/>
<br/>
  But there is still a dangerous side in the prosecution's proposal!
  <br/>
<br/>
  The prosecutor was the prosecutor.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The popular feminist view that has been circulating in recent years and presents the presence and conquest of rights in the presence of women in positions of responsibility such as PDP, prosecutors and judges, directors and administrators, in essence hides, legitimizes, co -exist Regardless of sex, they are called upon to serve those who take these positions.
  <br/>
<br/>
  It is a view that does not recognize the real enemy and traps the female movement in the impasse that proposes the system of oppression and exploitation as a one -way street. Distorts the words "right" and "conquest". It is the view that closes its eyes on the double oppression of the woman and does not recognize that the way for emancipation and release is the path of the relentless struggle to overthrow this system.
  <br/>
<br/>
  As such, a female prosecutor conquered the right to acquit the "unjust" and "in love" Micho who did not rapist, did not issue but "it made it easier for a child to be issued".

<p>
   Although I know about the importance of denouncing the oppression and violence that women and girls face in this society, I consider that - given the proletarian origin of International Women's Day - the workers must go beyond the complaints and fury Against domain and subjugation, which shelters all women regardless of whether they are explorators or exploited, and resume the flags of the struggles that gave rise to 8m.
  </p>
<p>
   To my regret, within this day it was not possible the speeches and the proposals that make the entire female movement to move forward in the fight. The difficulty in organizing a revolutionary female block underwent us to feel our voices before empty proposal slogans.
  </p>
<p>
   As a proletarian woman I consider that we cannot continue allowing the 8M to remain blurred, it is essential «March of the 20,000», a work strike in the New York shirt industry, declared on November 23, 1909 and that lasted 11 weeks, being the first largest strike of women in the US. The proletarian and peasant women must recover the ardor of the Russian women of 1917, when an 8m street went to the slogans "bread and peace", "below the tsar and down the war."
  </p>
<p>
   Women below we must go beyond the slogans against oppression; To those we must add our own slogans against the hell of exploitation, because as women of the working class we fight against economic and class relations imposed by the bloodthirsty capitalist system.
  </p>
<p>
   That in the 8M he did not get to one of our famous women: Comrade Clara Zetkin, who always urged our entire class to understand the situation of working women and, in that sense, not to put aside the true struggles and slogans of proletarian women, who do not focus exclusively on the consequences and manifestations of the power of capital over women: macho oppression, but also address the real causes of the daily suffering of all proletarians and our deepest desires: the economic exploitation and destruction of the entire bourgeois order.
  </p>
<p>
   And it cannot be otherwise, when in Colombia, capitalism is a conviction for 39.1 % of women over 15 who are not studying or have their own income, while that only happens to 16, 7 % of men. That the powerful voice of proletarian women claims in the streets, 8m and every day, that ends the obstacles that women must face to access their own income and conquer economic independence.
  </p>
<p>
   That the powerful voice of proletarian women denounced in the streets, 8m and every day, that lazy capital and swells with unpaid work that remains a disproportionate burden for women in Colombia and the world. According to statistics, the global working charge of women in the country is 14 hours and 49 minutes per day, and 49 % of this burden corresponds to unpaid work, which includes domestic and care work. This situation, which is part of the double exploitation faced by women in this society, shone by their absence in the slogans and songs of bourgeois feminism east 8m.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    It is essential to transcend the slogans that only emphasize the oppression of women in relationships, family and society and recognize double exploitation; Proletarian women demand concrete claims that address salary inequality, precarious working conditions and poorly paid or unpaid work, as well as subsidies and economic support for victims of gender violence.
   </p>
<p>
    I had never attended an 8M march, for the reasons stated above, but attending the last revealed the need for a more inclusive and truly combative female movement, which recognizes and represents the fair struggles of working women.

<p>
  On March 11, after the delay of salary payment, workers at the São Pedro Psychiatric Hospital, which is located in the Parthenon neighborhood of Porto Alegre, broke the institution's electronic point clock in the form of protest. It is the second consecutive month that salary delay occurs.
 </p>
<p>
  Workers say lack of payment is the responsibility of the government, which blocked more than $ 400,000 to be passed on to outsourced service companies. More than 150 hospital staff are backwards, and this is the second time the situation has repeated this year.
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, outsourced companies have also stopped paying employees at the São Pedro Psychiatric Hospital at other times. In 2019, hospital staff protested in Porto Alegre after salary delays caused because companies did not close the grades necessary for transfers.
 </p>
<p>
  Other important fights have already occurred at the hospital. At the end of last year, nurses from the institution protested against the government of Eduardo Leite (PSDB) for the implementation of the nursing floor.
 </p>
<p>
  The health of Rio Grande do Sul has been progressively scrapped by neglect and lack of funding, which in recent years has sharpened the mobilization, especially hospital staff, for the class struggle. In April 2023, officials from the Porto Alegre Institute of Cardiology, went on strike after the salary delay. The institution's response was the resignation of 280 hospital workers at the end of the year in December. The climate at the Institute follows indignation and protest.

  What is happening in Palestine is a genocide that has 
 characters of a real catastrophe. Richard Brennan, 
 Regional Director of the World Health Organization, Ha 
 said: “We are short of adjectives to describe the situation of 
 Gaza. Do we mean apocalyptic? We are beyond the catastrophe ". From 
 Over 30,000 Palestinians killed in the genocidal operation of the state 
 Nazi of Israel type Zionist, over 65% are women and 
 children. According to other sources, such as the United Nations UNRWA, the 
 number of children who died in this operation is greater than all 
 Children who died in all the last wars in recent years.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “There are beyond 
 70,000 wounded of war difficult to manage and the Institute of Medicine 
 International speaks of 85,000 possible deaths in the next six months 
 For unused trauma, diseases and mistreatment, for conditions 
 chronic not received, there were 36 hospitals in Gaza, today there are 12, for 
 more partially functioning and moreover with an accounting 
 Always to be updated due to the bombing. The hospital of 
 Al-Najah has 65 beds and hosts 300 sick people. I don't think I ever have 
 Assisted to nothing like this, "says Richard Brennan.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time, the same official says that a displacement like that of 
 Rafah had never seen him, nor had he seen offensive that 
 They force hospitals to evacuate en masse. "80% of the 
 population has been pushed to smaller areas e 
 overcrowded. In Rafah there is currently a bathroom every 400-600 
 People, outdoor defecation is widespread. For this they are in 
 course epidemics of diarrhea and hepatitis. We fear others. Before the 
 War the vaccinations rate in Gaza was very high, now it has jumped 
 All. A possible measles epidemic among malnutrite children 
 it could be highly fatal .... 15.5% of children under the two 
 years is seriously malnourish in this sense. In the face of this 
 aid are clearly insufficient and the promises of aid come 
 placed in times that are not suitable for the emergency situation 
 Absolute ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The initiatives of 
 aid parachute from above or the so -called port for aid 
 proposed by the United States reveal all the hypocrisy of this 
 operation, because the United States are the main supporters of the 
 Genocida plan of Israel and most of the weapons that the state 
 of Israel USA in these operations are of origin of the States 
 United, weapons that are continuously powered and therefore give the 
 State of Israel the possibility of a genocidal military activity 
 almost unlimited. How much hypocrisy of those who on the one hand kills e 
 Devasta and on the other he claims to help populations!
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are 
 unconditionally favorable to the ceasefire and upon arrival in the 
 Gaza strip of all humanitarian operations of any 
 type. The fundamental point is that it is necessary to support in all 
 ways the armed resistance of the Palestinian people because in the face of 
 This operation is nothing more than armed resistance.
 </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Imperialism has
All this is clear, so much so that it is working to block,
repress solidarity with the Palestinian people. In several countries
imperialist demonstrations are forbidden or put in difficulty.
And there is a campaign of persecution and criminalization against the
same events.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In our country 
 Things so far have gone better for a weave of problems, from a 
 side the strength of solidarity. There would be no doubt that 
 Any survey-Referendum would allow you to verify how much 
 great in our country solidarity at all levels with 
 the Palestinian people and the complaint of the genocidal plan of Israel, 
 regardless of the position, which can be differentiated 
 In the proletarian files, of the people, of the action of the Resistance 
 Palestinian.

  The Meloni government 
 It is strictly aligned with the state of Israel, it is an accomplice, the 
 Provides weapons, it is an integral part of the developed operation 
 from American imperialism, of which he is strictly ally and servant. 
 This government is increasingly intended to align with the address 
 to stop not genocide but solidarity with resistance 
 Palestinian.
  <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In these two 
 days the case of L'Aquila emerged where, in the face of one 
 growing mobilization of solidarity with a political prisoner 
 Palestinian arrested in our country and at risk of extradition in 
 These hours, faced with solidarity initiatives, the government 
 Instead of welcoming the requests of the political prisoner 
 Palestinian of refusal of extract and the campaign of 
 solidarity that exists towards it, widens the operation 
 repressive towards other Palestinians accusing them of being terrorists, 
 to prepare actions against Italy and Israel, to refer to one 
 of the organizations of the Palestinian resistance, an integral part 
 of the action of 7 October.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   It is, beyond 
 there of everything, of a repressive operation for which they stop 
 people accused of nothing, because no action of character 
 military or unworthy of "terrorism" has never occurred 
 in our country that justifies this operation, while on the other 
 The right of the Palestinian people and its organizations of 
 Responding to the war of aggression and genocide of Israel is 
 unlimited, as is unlimited the type of action that Israel carries out 
 on a world scale, also through services, in persecution 
 of Palestinian organizations.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The right to 
 Hit Israel objectives is legitimate and is an integral part 
 of the response of the resistance to the war of genocidal aggression 
 of the state of Israel and therefore it must be defended as such. 
 The operation against these Palestinian companions is an operation of 
 general intimidation towards the Palestinians in our country that 
 they are going down massively in the square and in particular in the 
 City of Milan where, since after 7 October, events every Saturday 
 very large, constant, with the participation not only of the 
 Palestinians, but of all the social and political realities that are 
 solidarity, they follow one another, making Milan a sort of capital 
 of solidarity with the Resistance and in Milan there was also one 
 National event on February 24, very participated.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   It's clear that 
 They want to stop these manifestations and you want, through the 
 same operation of L'Aquila, prepare a campaign of 
 criminalization towards Palestinian realities that in our country 
 they are descending to the square with the heart and soul for what 
 It happens in Gaza.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Because of this 
 it is absolutely necessary to reject, denounce, the repressive operation 
 de L'Aquila. We are all terrorists if they accuse themselves of terrorism i 
 Palestinian companions arrested in L'Aquila.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Furthermore, one 
 of political prisoners is the reason for the national campaign, 
 also international, existing to prevent it from being extradited.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The true 
 Terrorism are the bombs of imperialism!
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The terrorism of
Nazi character and reminiscent of genocide, the Holocaust, is that
of the State of Israel. This genocide of the State of Israel is
He is also under indictment at the Court of Justice in The Hague.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Condemn
Palestinians, even if it were true that their aim is to
Contributing to Palestinian resistance around the world, is like
to strike at those who developed resistance against Nazism and the
fascism in this country. Although the situations are extremely
the appeal to the fact that the Palestinians are the partisans of
This battle is a just and historically valid call. Therefore
the L'Aquila operation must fall and the mobilization for the
The liberation of these Palestinian brothers and sisters of ours must be extended
in all cities.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   This is 
 necessary because, like the Operation of L'Aquila is an operation 
 preventive, intimidative towards the entire movement, it is clear that a 
 prevention of repressive operations, prohibitions and persecutions that 
 can affect the Palestinian community, the supportive people in ours 
 country, it must be the same. So we are because in 
 particular in the events of this Saturday, in Milan as 
 elsewhere and in the period of new events that in all cities 
 Italian solidarity forces are promoting, is put big 
 evidence the request for liberation for the Palestinian companions 
 arrested in L'Aquila.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The level of 
 crime that develops by the state of Israel towards i 
 political prisoners. Today all the newspapers appear images 
 unequivocal of the doctors, who have been denuded, kept in the cold, 
 held naked prisoners. The title of the Manifesto, says: “Medici 
 abused ".
  </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    That conduct 
 against the Palestinian people is a war, a war against a 
 whole people reminiscent of the worst pages of history 
 of humanity. As much as we all are aspiring to peace, it is necessary 
 consider that wars, as it was for Nazism, how it is 
 been for other historical episodes of this country, think of Vietnam, 
 Those who want peace must respond with the war, because only the 
 the right war, the war of peoples, can stop the march of the 
 wars, reactionary wars, antipopolar genocide, 
 imperialist.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    This does not apply
only in Palestine, it also applies in Ukraine, it applies in all scenarios
where the monster of war, the tendency towards a third world war,
it is developing and getting closer.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    War 
 world, the aggression wars of the peoples produce of 
 consequently a gigantic waste of money and funds for weapons, on 
 This I will speak briefly.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    World spending 
 In 2023 it increased for the ninth consecutive year in real terms, 
 A sum that approaches $ 2500 billion. The director 
 of the Sipri, the International Institute of Research on Peace of 
 Stockholm, he says that this expense will increase this year and for the 
 next years.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    The expense of 
 wars is bringing the war industries, the top players how they come 
 calls, widens in particular in Europe, the 345 business 
 billions of dollars and splash the wallets, organs of the greats 
 player, Il Sole 24 Ore of February 28 highlights the relationship between 
 war and profits, an organic, historical, structural relationship of 
 capitalist and imperialist production. Just looking 
 the trend of the drafts and taking into consideration the period from 
 January 2 to 26 February 2024, Il Sole 24 Ore publishes the 
 percentages of growth in the profits of the war industry. On the first 
 place there is the Rheinmetall, a German industry +394% of profits, 
 Then Saab, Leonardo is in third place.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    It is more than 
 justified, therefore, that in many realities have begun and yes 
 develop initiatives against Leonardo, the complaints. 
 Leonardo is the heart of the war industry in our country, 
 sting of the war economy in this country which is useless to repeat that they are billions spent on weapons and for the 
 war that counterbalance the money that is spent for the 
 health, school, work, in the face of wages that decrease 
 in our country also for the caravan, in the face of governments that 
 attack citizenship income, which deny the minimum wage e 
 then they push the population towards relative and absolute poverty 
 and in particular the poorest, less protected masses, in ours 
 country: over 5 million workers in our country are who 
 take wages from hunger, insufficient salaries not only for not 
 get to the end of the month, but which make a life almost impossible 
 decent.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    In the face of everything 
 This we have our governments, our states, which they fill 
 of money, of orders, the military industries and primarily the Leonardo, 
 our government like other governments in the world because the 
 military industries are global industries that sell weapons everywhere and 
 In all shapes and ways.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    So the 
 Leonardo as the heart of the war system is an industry that must 
 be more and more subject to initiatives of struggle, of denunciation, e 
 Not only of denunciation, in all large and small realities in this 
 village. In the new cycle of solidarity initiatives with the people 
 Palestinian will be necessary, precisely in order not to make only 
 repetitive and not only expressive of the feeling of solidarity 
 of our people, they must become more incisive, more targeted and 
 So even the Leonardo issue of the war industry must be 
 Very clear in the agenda of the next mobilization for Palestine.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    Leonardo is also a company run by government men
and the war industries.
   </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Solidarity with 
 Palestine, fight against war and the war industry, with al 
 LEONARDO CENTRO, RELATIONSHIP between this situation and the more general 
 international situation, relationship between this situation and the 
 economic situation in our country, a relationship between this situation 
 and the worsening of the conditions of salary, work, schools, 
 of social services for popular masses.
    </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Among all this 
 There is a link and this link must be highlighted in the 
 mobilization of all those who do not agree with this state 
 of existing things.

   March 18 - day of solidarity with political prisoners -
  </strong>
<br>
<strong>
   In honor of the communist and revolutionary prisoners
  </strong>
</br></h2>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  On March 18, the International Solidarity Day with political prisoners. Red Help was founded by the Comintern in 1920 and declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the founding of the Paris Community, for "International Solidarity Day with political prisoners" and dedicated it to political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity is expressed with political prisoners around the world.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     The reactionary Indian state has blocked over 10,000 communist, revolutionary and political activists inside, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent the People's War.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, even though he has endured his punishment. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners from oppressed people from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     The fears of the ruling classes of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enemy they feel to them is so great that they ruthlessly prevent the communists and revolutionaries whom they hold trapped in obvious battle with their own laws from leaving prisons. The murder of chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of PCP, who lost his health after 29 years in isolation prison, and whose death was due to the fact that the necessary measures were not taken is very important to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred that the imperialists and the servile owners of the ruling system feel. Those responsible for chairman Gonzalo's death burned and even crushed his corpse.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
     The communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons try to meet the demands of the class struggle with the danger of their lives by going to the limit of prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation imprisonment. We must mobilize ourselves to support the legitimate battle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against any kind of aggression against the prisoners, to be the prisoners' voice outside, we must support their struggle under the prison conditions as part of the class fight outside.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      The communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Supporting the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">

      Let's make the communist and revolutionary prisoners' resistance and struggle to our own. Let's be the voice of the prisoners!

<p>
  Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid confirmed, in a plea bargain with the Federal Police (PF), that Bolsonaro held at least five meetings with high-ranking military officers to discuss coup plans. The information, disclosed in a column by Bela Megale, from the monopoly newspaper O Globo, at the same time reveals the level of participation of high-ranking military officers in the far-right coup plans, and proves the knowledge and omission of the other generals about the institutional rupture.
 </p>
<p>
  The first reported meeting took place in July 2022. With the presence of ministers and the military, it was there that Bolsonaro openly announced a coup plan and generals such as Augusto Heleno stated that, if it was "to turn the tables", it would have to be "before the elections". A full video of the meeting, which recorded the positions of other ministers and military personnel in favor of the rupture, was found on Cid's computer and made available in full in the press last month.
 </p>
<p>
  Another meeting was on December 7, 2022, in which the commanders of the Armed Forces participated. In it, Bolsonaro presented the so -called “scam draft” to the commanders, and Admiral Almir Garnier agreed to make the troops available to Bolsonaro. This meeting is one of the central evidence that the former Army commander, now regarded as “legalist” by certain sectors committed to the barracks, was fully aware of institutional rupture plans. It is also known that other generals, as were theophilo, attended meetings with the same content at Gomes' request. The versions put the image that the former commander seeks to propagate about himself as "contrary to the coup." At most, Freire Gomes was against (but did nothing to prevent) the break, but cabled several movements in favor of the intervention of the Armed Forces High Command in national political life, as designed by the preferable generals of a veiled coup in the country.
 </p>
<p>
  Already at the end of the year, Bolsonaro met twice with officers to think about the performance of the reactionary military in far-right demonstrations. One of them occurred with the major -trained major in the special forces (
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  Black), Rafael Martins, in Brasilia, on December 12th. Martins is known for requesting, days after the meeting, R $ 100,000 to Mauro Cid to play the trip of green chickens to Brasilia and have requested guidance from “places for demonstrations”, where
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  Black would act with the far-right celeds. At 12/12 meeting, the major discussed Bolsonaro “matters related to the coup strategy”, according to information released by Megale. The second meeting of this type took place on 12/28 and featured Colonel Bernardo Romão Correia Neto, assistant to the Southern Military Command and formed in the "Special Forces". In addition to Romão, advisers of generals favorable to the coup and other special forces attended the meeting. According to Cid, Romão was responsible for selecting the guests for the meeting.
 </p>
<p>
  In the background, there is just again in the new information revealed about the ICD denunciation. However, it is important, however, the reschedule of proof of the omission of generals such as Freire Gomes in the face of institutional rupture, precisely because they are not essentially disagreeing with the coup. Just disagree with how to do it and when to do so. In addition, it is noteworthy how the list of high official military personnel that proven to take part in the plans of institutional rupture is growing, also proves the coup essence of the Brazilian Armed Forces, widespread from above the military institution. The names range from generals, or not intermediated by advisors, to colonels and major.

  The Greek government with its decision to send the frigate "Hydra" to the Red Sea as part of the European Union's mission Eunavfor Aspides escalates the country's involvement in imperialist philosopher war designs. After all, the operational center of the mission is in Larissa and at the same time the base of Souda and other American bases in our country are actively involved in the genocide of the Palestinian people, in every way reinforcing the fascist-Zionist state of Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  Already the frigate of the navy on Wednesday 13/3 was involved in the first war incident in the war area of the Red Sea, firing missiles against unmanned drones of the Houthis. National Defence Minister N. Dendias cynically stated that "We are proud of our country's operations conducted to protect the national interest..."
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   The ND government, bourgeois political staff and local capitalist order are dangerous. They drag our people into war. They are preparing us to bleed again for the interests of American and European imperialists. On the one hand, Mr Mitsotakis' visit to Ukraine as a US medium and the mission of war equipment. On the other hand, the country's accession to the US geopolitical planning for the NA Mediterranean and the Middle East now accompanied by the Navy. They drag the country and the people at the center of imperialist competition for the world's re-firming, baptizing a national interest in the US-EU.
  </p>
<p>
   At the same time that the government, on behalf of the foreign and local capital, escalates the attack on the rights of the people by sowing poverty, poverty, accuracy, fills the funds of the imperialist war industries with two -euro. On this basis, the lives of the people and the workers will continue to sacrifice on the altar of profit. Like the lives of the two Greek seafarers, they were sacrificed for the profits of Greek shipowners, while the government and the system celebrate the success of the Greek frigate Hydra, one of the "Navy of our Navy", during its involvement two unmanned aircraft.
  </p>
<p>
   The people, the workers and the youth will not become meat in the cannons of imperialists. There is a greater need than ever to grow and massive an anti-imperialist movement that requires the country to be unraveled by imperialist war plans that struggle to leave the imperialists from the country that declare its tangible solidarity. In the struggle of the Palestinian people!

  A new aggression against students from the “Raúl Isidro Burgos” Rural Normal School in Ayotzinapa, Guerrero has taken the life of a student from the mentioned institution. On the night of 7
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, elements of the state police of the mentioned entity opened fire against a private vehicle where three young normal students were traveling. In the events, the Yankee student Kothan Gómez Peralta was murdered and another student named Osiel “N” was arrested, who according to versions of comrade Vidulfo Rosales, lawyer for the Tlachinollan organization and legal advisor to the committee of fathers and mothers of the 43… “

   to make him declare himself

   guilty
  </em>
<em>
   of
  </em>
<em>
   having carried weapons and having fired shots.”
  </em>
  According to the state police of Guerrero, the young people were armed and driving a stolen vehicle from where they allegedly shot at the uniformed officers at a checkpoint on the old Tixlta pass, very close to the exit of Chilpancingo, capital of the entity. This version is a hoax set up by the narco-big landlord government of Guerrero, and has already been denied by AMLO himself who this morning acknowledged that the expert tests carried out confirm that the murdered student did not fire any weapon and that the case will be brought by the FGR

  and it is a setup to blame the comrades. This occurs in an important political context for the normal school. On the one hand, the school celebrates 98 years since its foundation, proudly carrying the epithet of “

  of March we carried out the first phase of our

  <strong>
   Flood the streets and squares with red flags!

</p>
<p>
  As we have said
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/03/mexico-statement-on-the-day-of-struggle/">
   before
  </a>
  , this mobilization has been a response to the lack of solution to the demands for justice and the repression that hovers over the popular movement and the peoples of Oaxaca.
 </p>
<p>
  In this way, the contingents from regions such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Basin, the Coast, the Sierra Sur, the Mixteca and the Central Valleys came together fulfilling the method:
  <strong>
   Task set, task accomplished!

  At 8:00 a.m. our contingents began the mass rally at the Zonal Market of Santa Rosa Panzacola, which has been a historical reference point for our mobilizations. In this place, the comrades of the People’s Youth Brigades placed a large Palestinian flag on the stairs of the pedestrian bridge as an expression of recognition of the heroic national liberation struggle carried out by the Palestinian National Resistance. Our democratic organization greets the exemplary counter-offensive “Al-Aqsa Flood” initiated on the 7
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of October, 2023 and sustained until today with courageous armed actions against the Zionist invader.
  <strong>
   From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!

  At 9:30 a.m. our contingents began to prepare for the momentary blockade of the international highway. Revolutionary activists made some graffiti greeting the International Communist League, which announced its constitution to the world in December of 2022.

<p>
  Our march began at 10:00 a.m. and immediately the red flags were unfolded on the international highway. As it went on, other contingents of comrades joined in, thickening the ranks. The youth continued to paint the slogans:
  <em>
<strong>
    “The Interoceanic Corridor dispossesses and kills poor and indigenous peasants!”
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    Hands off
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    Goes for! "
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “Whoever governs, the rights of the people are defended!”
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “Boycott the bourgeois electoral farce!”
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
   ,
  </em>
<em>
<strong>
    “Don’t vote, organize and
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    struggle!
   </strong>
</em>
<em>
<strong>
    “
   </strong>
</em>
  , among others.
 </p>
<p>
  As it went on, the masses were removing electoral propaganda of various candidates and parties. The amount of public money that is spent on the electoral circus of the big bourgeoisie is outrageous; money that the candidates and parties invest in propaganda, advertising, stationery, etc. and which are useless for the people since they only generate garbage while the popular neighborhoods and communities lack public services and, in addition, Oaxaca is suffering a wave of fires at this moment. An example is the communities of San Lucas Quiaviní, San Pablo Güila, Santiago Matatlán, San Dionicio Ocotepec, among others, whose forests and communal lands have been devastated by fire, showing the technical incapacity of the State, which does not have sufficient logistics and infrastructure to face these disasters, some of them caused by the latifundium and illegal loggers. Perhaps there are no resources to prevent and quell forest fires, but there is a budget for the electoral circus.
  <strong>
   That
  </strong>
<strong>
   is why the people reject it!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The march stopped at the PRI headquarters and a brief rally was held there where the comrades recalled the responsibility of this party in the war against the people, particularly during the dirty war that lasted from 1965 to the end of the 80s, and also its responsibility in the counterinsurgency actions against the Zapatista uprising and the EZLN, against the EPR uprising, against the UNAM strike and against the mass movements such as the APPO in 2006 in Oaxaca.
 </p>
<p>
  There the activists shouted slogans and painted graffiti. A gigantic rat was drawn on the entrance door with the caption “garbage dump of history”; all the electoral propaganda was also deposited there and finally the people set fire to it as part of the actions of the boycott against the bourgeois electoral farce.
 </p>
<p>
  The march continued towards the main square of the city and during its route thousands of leaflets were distributed explaining to the people our organization’s demands for justice, denouncing the war against the people and call not to vote. The contingents arrived at 12:45 p.m. and the esplanade was immediately filled; there a rally was held and the masses took over the palace of ignominy (or government palace). At the end of the rally, tents were set up, a central module and stalls of our comrades, artisans and street vendors violently evicted by the municipal and state police on the 17
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  Of February on the Girl Avenue Were Placed.
  <strong>
   The sit-in is a form of protest and frees spaces, returning them to the people in struggle!
  </strong>
  The friends of the League of Communities for the Agrarian Revolution set up a small stand where they exhibited organic products grown by the peasants in the communities in resistance, which are 100% free of agro-chemicals and support the rescue of native seeds.
 </p>
<p>
  Later, a political-cultural event was held while an enlarged dialogue commission appointed by our organization entered the palace of ignominy to state the demands for justice and the demand their solution.

<p>
  In the morning, after breakfast and the general organization of the contingent, a mass assembly was held in the University Gymnasium of the UABJO in the historic center, which was packed by the sea of red flags that immediately took possession of all the stairs and corridors where the dialogue commission gave a detailed report of the points of discussion with the State and federal government, as well as the different routes of attention to the various issues. Among these, the most outstanding are the demand for the presentation alive of our comrade Dr. Ernesto Sernas García. who was a professor at precisely this University and was forcefully disappeared on the 10

  Clearly our democratic organization holds high its flags, which are the red flags of the
  <strong>
   New Democratic Revolution
  </strong>
  , agrarian and anti-imperialist, uninterrupted towards
  <strong>
   Socialism
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  This first phase of our
  <strong>
   Day of Struggle
  </strong>
  has also been a call to the working people, encouraging them to trust in their own forces and call them to the organized struggle to stop the war against the people, rejecting the bourgeois electoral farce. It is also a way of marking fire against reformism and contemporary revisionism which is already taking up its eternal chant of calling the bourgeois elections “a form of struggle”, joining the last wagon of the electoral train legitimizing the regime. We insist:
  <strong>
   Elections are not the solution, the solution is revolution!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Incidents.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  No major incidents were recorded, except for the aggression of some fully identified provocateurs who from a store on the international highway threw objects at the contingent and the media, who witnessed the aggression and the well-deserved response of the masses. These individuals have been allies of the local PRI and as good acrobats they are now in Morena; they have always been historical enemies of the people’s movement since the times of the APPO and the people of Oaxaca will never forget that.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also important to mention that we no longer find the metal fences that were placed days ago on the entrance streets to the esplanade of the main square.
 </p>
<p>
  We again salute our class and our people; the heroic Palestinian people and their exemplary national liberation struggle; the ongoing people’s wars in Peru, Turkey, India and the Philippines; and the workers and peoples rising up against exploitation and oppression. We strongly salute the efforts to constitute the Anti-Imperialist League at the international level and maintain:
  <strong>
   Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Stop the war against the people!
   <br>
   Don’t vote, organize and struggle!
  </br></strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Whoever governs, the rights of the people are defended!
   <br>
   With the Red Sun the people will win!
  </br></strong>

  While ruin, unemployment, dispossession, looting, drought, paramilitarism, criminal violence, militarization, murders, femicides, disappearances, etc. The great bourgeoisie is stopped with its electoral campaigns where more than 60 thousand 451 million pesos are waste, which could well be invested in public services, education and health for the masses.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The elections in Mexico are the most expensive in the world and it is evident that the needs of the people are not a priority for the old state of landowners and great bourgeois despite the story of the political alternation in this country where governments have already paraded of the PRI, Pan and now Morena.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Once again, none of the coalitions or parties of the great bourgeoisie, none of its representatives (without gender distinction) has the capacity or interest in solving the problems that afflict the poor people.
  <strong>
   Neither Claudia, nor Xóchitl, nor are Jorge an alternative of anything!
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Moreover, the elections in our country have the characteristic of being particularly violent, since the different bourgeois factions often contend not only at the polls but also in weapons. This is clear with the current data: from the beginning of the pre-campaigns last November until March 6 of this year, there are already 23 homicides of different politicians, 13 of them sighs to some position and 10 more that served as public servants or political operators. It is clear that the figure will not remain there and the longer the fatal date of June 2 without a doubt we will know more about this. It is the usual, the bourgeois electoral farce in Mexico Chorrea blood in each of its episodes.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The people know it, so it once again challenges bourgeois legality hugging the call to the boycott against the electoral farce.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Here we share some of the first actions carried out by the town in different parts of the country.

  On February 21, a group of people launched Molotov stones and cocktails against the facilities of the Institute of Elections and Citizen Participation in Chiapas (IEPC). The fire managed to consume a part of the electoral stationery and the furniture inside the building. The action caused the response of the Firefighters, the State Police and the National Guard who immediately reached the flames.

  On March 4, during a mobilization where around a thousand people participated, the masses withdrew electoral propaganda from various parties making a -mit stop in front of the PRI state offices. In that place they were painted by the boycott and the withdrawal propaganda was deposited by setting fire in the midst of multiple slogans such as
  <strong>
   "The elections are not the solution, the solution is the revolution!"
  </strong>
  y
  <strong>
   "Do not vote, do not vote, prepare to fight!"

  Within the framework of the plant held by the fathers and mothers of the 43 together with other democratic organizations, the classmates of the Federation of Socialist students of Mexico (FECSM) have accompanied the actions raising their combativity. On March 6, the normalistas took a CFE truck and after a jaloneo with the City Police and the Military Police managed to demolish part of the side door of the National Palace. The FECSM continues to increase actions for the electoral process considering that on September 26, 10 years of the forced disappearance of their peers will be completed. The normalist movement is spearhead in the call to the boycott against the bourgeois electoral farce.

  While the contradiction between the popular masses and the old state is deepened, the trend is the exacerbation of the class struggle in the perspective of the New Democracy Revolution, breaking with the patrañas of the regime and its false democracy.

  These initial actions will surely find echo in other latitudes of national geography reinforcing the path that various peoples have already initiated in the perspective of the liberation of territories and the exercise of embryos again, that is: self -determination, self -government and self -defense.
