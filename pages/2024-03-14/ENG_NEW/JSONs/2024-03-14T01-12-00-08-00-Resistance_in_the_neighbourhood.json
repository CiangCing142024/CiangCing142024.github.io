Unfortunately, this is not a mere negligence of the lack of readiness of its organizers. It is a glaring option for exclusion for anything that reminds the greatest genocide of the 21st century that is currently being held in Palestine by the Zionist, fascist state of Israel, with the US-NATO-EU contacted.\n <br/>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   This is not a random choice. It is directly related to the policy of the current Greek government (but also of the previous ones) to develop close relations with the occupation of Israel and to completely change even this policy of older Greek governments of the Transition against the Palestinian struggle. It is related to its involvement in the war in Ukraine and its mission to the Reds on the side of Westerners and Israel. That is why at a time when the most reactionary and criminal wing of the Zionists in our country are ruled by those who support the Palestinian struggle. It is a clear political choice for the organizers of the festival, and in the city that has experienced and knows how to stigmatize the anthropomic from whatever status they are committed and whatever they do.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In the face of this challenge, one progressive man of the city, none of the spectators of the festival can remain indifferent. Must disapprove of this unacceptable option. He must protest and even ask for the 26th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival to include in a special screening, even a documentary on the modern Palestine tragedy.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: right;\">\n   11/03/2024\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Intervention of the Exclusion: Friday 15/3, outside the Olympics, at 7:30 pm\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   NO to Palestinian People's Genocide\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   WINNING IN PALESTINIKI RESISTANT- LEFTERIA IN PALESTINI!\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <b>\n    <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n     NEW CONCEPTION- DRAWING\n    </span>\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <b>\n    <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n     THURSDAY 21/3 | 7 pm | Venizelos Statue\n    </span>\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <b>\n    <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n     ORGANIZATIONS- COLLECTIONS OF THESSALONIKI\n    </span>\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n   <b>\n    <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n     Members of the Palestinian Community of Thessaloniki\n    </span>\n   </b>\n  </p>\n  <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n  </div>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3.\u039c."], "labels": ["\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7", "\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2", "\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/153-730.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
