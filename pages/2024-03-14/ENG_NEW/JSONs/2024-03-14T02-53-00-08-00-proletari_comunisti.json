We are beyond the catastrophe \". From \n Over 30,000 Palestinians killed in the genocidal operation of the state \n Nazi of Israel type Zionist, over 65% are women and \n children.

The hospital of \n Al-Najah has 65 beds and hosts 300 sick people. I don't think I ever have \n Assisted to nothing like this, \"says Richard Brennan.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  In the same \n time, the same official says that a displacement like that of \n Rafah had never seen him, nor had he seen offensive that \n They force hospitals to evacuate en masse. \"80% of the \n population has been pushed to smaller areas e \n overcrowded. In Rafah there is currently a bathroom every 400-600 \n People, outdoor defecation is widespread. For this they are in \n course epidemics of diarrhea and hepatitis. We fear others. Before the \n War the vaccinations rate in Gaza was very high, now it has jumped \n All.
