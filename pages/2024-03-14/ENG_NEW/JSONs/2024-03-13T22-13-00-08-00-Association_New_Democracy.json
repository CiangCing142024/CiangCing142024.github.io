It is already popular wisdom that a \n Government of the exploiting classes lies in two ways: one is lying \n made, blatantly, the other is publishing statistics that, by showing it \n Everything hides the fundamental. The growth of 3% of GDP is a figure \n artificial leveraged by the record harvest of the agro -export large estate, whose \n Export of its production, for example, does not contribute to taxes; No \n They suppose no improvement for the economic situation of most of the \n population, that is, of the workers, as is the case with the price of the basket \n Basic food, which became more expensive in February (in 14 of the 17 \n capitals, there was a price increase). Only in Rio de Janeiro, the increase was \n on average 5.1%.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span span=\"\">\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <span>\n   <span>\n    Luiz Inacio can't talk too much about \n \"Agrobusiness\", because it would sound strange, even more after having delivered the \n greater safra plan in the history of the country, far superior to Bolsonaro, \n while, for the \u201cagrarian reform\u201d of the old, in 2023 and 2024, the current \n Government assigned miserable 2,000 million reais, the same amount as \n Bolsonaro had allocated in 2021.

To act with dignity, as a political force \n Independent, workers need to free themselves from limitations \n ideological, according to which they must be content with the minimum. The \"minimum\", \n achieved today through the deceptive call to save the country from the hands of \n a scoundrel and support for a government sitting in the lap of the right and \n The conciliation with the hard core of the coup, is condemning them to a future. \n in which the \"minimum\" will be even worse. Thus continues to cheat the old order to \n masses, all guaranteed by the well -known blackmail: \u201cThings are not \n Well, that sure, but it is possible, and everything will go worse if you do not settle. \u201d \n Since ancient times, this has been the most effective way to keep the \n slaves. It is also a signal confirmed by the story that systems such as \n This, regardless of the rulers' maneuvers, will collapse and will be \n sweeps.\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <o:p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "Weekly editorial - change in government balances on Pinuela to act with dignity, as an index political force ...", "author": ["Verein der Neuen Demokratie"], "source": "https://vnd-peru.blogspot.com/2024/03/and-brasil-editorial-semanal-cambio-en.html", "source_name": "Association New Democracy"}
