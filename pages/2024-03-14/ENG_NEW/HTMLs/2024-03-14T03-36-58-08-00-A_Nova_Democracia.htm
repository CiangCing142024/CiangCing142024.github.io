 <p>
  Lieutenant Colonel Mauro Cid confirmed, in a plea bargain with the Federal Police (PF), that Bolsonaro held at least five meetings with high-ranking military officers to discuss coup plans. The information, disclosed in a column by Bela Megale, from the monopoly newspaper O Globo, at the same time reveals the level of participation of high-ranking military officers in the far-right coup plans, and proves the knowledge and omission of the other generals about the institutional rupture.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first reported meeting took place in July 2022. With the presence of ministers and the military, it was there that Bolsonaro openly announced a coup plan and generals such as Augusto Heleno stated that, if it was "to turn the tables", it would have to be "before the elections". A full video of the meeting, which recorded the positions of other ministers and military personnel in favor of the rupture, was found on Cid's computer and made available in full in the press last month.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another meeting was on December 7, 2022, in which the commanders of the Armed Forces participated. In it, Bolsonaro presented the so -called “scam draft” to the commanders, and Admiral Almir Garnier agreed to make the troops available to Bolsonaro. This meeting is one of the central evidence that the former Army commander, now regarded as “legalist” by certain sectors committed to the barracks, was fully aware of institutional rupture plans. It is also known that other generals, as were theophilo, attended meetings with the same content at Gomes' request. The versions put the image that the former commander seeks to propagate about himself as "contrary to the coup." At most, Freire Gomes was against (but did nothing to prevent) the break, but cabled several movements in favor of the intervention of the Armed Forces High Command in national political life, as designed by the preferable generals of a veiled coup in the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  Already at the end of the year, Bolsonaro met twice with officers to think about the performance of the reactionary military in far-right demonstrations. One of them occurred with the major -trained major in the special forces (

  Black), Rafael Martins, in Brasilia, on December 12th. Martins is known for requesting, days after the meeting, R $ 100,000 to Mauro Cid to play the trip of green chickens to Brasilia and have requested guidance from “places for demonstrations”, where

  Black would act with the far-right celeds. At 12/12 meeting, the major discussed Bolsonaro “matters related to the coup strategy”, according to information released by Megale. The second meeting of this type took place on 12/28 and featured Colonel Bernardo Romão Correia Neto, assistant to the Southern Military Command and formed in the "Special Forces". In addition to Romão, advisers of generals favorable to the coup and other special forces attended the meeting. According to Cid, Romão was responsible for selecting the guests for the meeting.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the background, there is just again in the new information revealed about the ICD denunciation. However, it is important, however, the reschedule of proof of the omission of generals such as Freire Gomes in the face of institutional rupture, precisely because they are not essentially disagreeing with the coup. Just disagree with how to do it and when to do so. In addition, it is noteworthy how the list of high official military personnel that proven to take part in the plans of institutional rupture is growing, also proves the coup essence of the Brazilian Armed Forces, widespread from above the military institution. The names range from generals, or not intermediated by advisors, to colonels and major.
