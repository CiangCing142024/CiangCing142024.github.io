  What is happening in Palestine is a genocide that has 
 characters of a real catastrophe. Richard Brennan, 
 Regional Director of the World Health Organization, Ha 
 said: “We are short of adjectives to describe the situation of 
 Gaza. Do we mean apocalyptic? We are beyond the catastrophe ". From 
 Over 30,000 Palestinians killed in the genocidal operation of the state 
 Nazi of Israel type Zionist, over 65% are women and 
 children. According to other sources, such as the United Nations UNRWA, the 
 number of children who died in this operation is greater than all 
 Children who died in all the last wars in recent years.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “There are beyond 
 70,000 wounded of war difficult to manage and the Institute of Medicine 
 International speaks of 85,000 possible deaths in the next six months 
 For unused trauma, diseases and mistreatment, for conditions 
 chronic not received, there were 36 hospitals in Gaza, today there are 12, for 
 more partially functioning and moreover with an accounting 
 Always to be updated due to the bombing. The hospital of 
 Al-Najah has 65 beds and hosts 300 sick people. I don't think I ever have 
 Assisted to nothing like this, "says Richard Brennan.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the same 
 time, the same official says that a displacement like that of 
 Rafah had never seen him, nor had he seen offensive that 
 They force hospitals to evacuate en masse. "80% of the 
 population has been pushed to smaller areas e 
 overcrowded. In Rafah there is currently a bathroom every 400-600 
 People, outdoor defecation is widespread. For this they are in 
 course epidemics of diarrhea and hepatitis. We fear others. Before the 
 War the vaccinations rate in Gaza was very high, now it has jumped 
 All. A possible measles epidemic among malnutrite children 
 it could be highly fatal .... 15.5% of children under the two 
 years is seriously malnourish in this sense. In the face of this 
 aid are clearly insufficient and the promises of aid come 
 placed in times that are not suitable for the emergency situation 
 Absolute ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The initiatives of 
 aid parachute from above or the so -called port for aid 
 proposed by the United States reveal all the hypocrisy of this 
 operation, because the United States are the main supporters of the 
 Genocida plan of Israel and most of the weapons that the state 
 of Israel USA in these operations are of origin of the States 
 United, weapons that are continuously powered and therefore give the 
 State of Israel the possibility of a genocidal military activity 
 almost unlimited. How much hypocrisy of those who on the one hand kills e 
 Devasta and on the other he claims to help populations!
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are 
 unconditionally favorable to the ceasefire and upon arrival in the 
 Gaza strip of all humanitarian operations of any 
 type. The fundamental point is that it is necessary to support in all 
 ways the armed resistance of the Palestinian people because in the face of 
 This operation is nothing more than armed resistance.
 </p>
 <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Imperialism has
All this is clear, so much so that it is working to block,
repress solidarity with the Palestinian people. In several countries
imperialist demonstrations are forbidden or put in difficulty.
And there is a campaign of persecution and criminalization against the
same events.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In our country 
 Things so far have gone better for a weave of problems, from a 
 side the strength of solidarity. There would be no doubt that 
 Any survey-Referendum would allow you to verify how much 
 great in our country solidarity at all levels with 
 the Palestinian people and the complaint of the genocidal plan of Israel, 
 regardless of the position, which can be differentiated 
 In the proletarian files, of the people, of the action of the Resistance 
 Palestinian.

  The Meloni government 
 It is strictly aligned with the state of Israel, it is an accomplice, the 
 Provides weapons, it is an integral part of the developed operation 
 from American imperialism, of which he is strictly ally and servant. 
 This government is increasingly intended to align with the address 
 to stop not genocide but solidarity with resistance 
 Palestinian.
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In these two 
 days the case of L'Aquila emerged where, in the face of one 
 growing mobilization of solidarity with a political prisoner 
 Palestinian arrested in our country and at risk of extradition in 
 These hours, faced with solidarity initiatives, the government 
 Instead of welcoming the requests of the political prisoner 
 Palestinian of refusal of extract and the campaign of 
 solidarity that exists towards it, widens the operation 
 repressive towards other Palestinians accusing them of being terrorists, 
 to prepare actions against Italy and Israel, to refer to one 
 of the organizations of the Palestinian resistance, an integral part 
 of the action of 7 October.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   It is, beyond 
 there of everything, of a repressive operation for which they stop 
 people accused of nothing, because no action of character 
 military or unworthy of "terrorism" has never occurred 
 in our country that justifies this operation, while on the other 
 The right of the Palestinian people and its organizations of 
 Responding to the war of aggression and genocide of Israel is 
 unlimited, as is unlimited the type of action that Israel carries out 
 on a world scale, also through services, in persecution 
 of Palestinian organizations.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The right to 
 Hit Israel objectives is legitimate and is an integral part 
 of the response of the resistance to the war of genocidal aggression 
 of the state of Israel and therefore it must be defended as such. 
 The operation against these Palestinian companions is an operation of 
 general intimidation towards the Palestinians in our country that 
 they are going down massively in the square and in particular in the 
 City of Milan where, since after 7 October, events every Saturday 
 very large, constant, with the participation not only of the 
 Palestinians, but of all the social and political realities that are 
 solidarity, they follow one another, making Milan a sort of capital 
 of solidarity with the Resistance and in Milan there was also one 
 National event on February 24, very participated.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   It's clear that 
 They want to stop these manifestations and you want, through the 
 same operation of L'Aquila, prepare a campaign of 
 criminalization towards Palestinian realities that in our country 
 they are descending to the square with the heart and soul for what 
 It happens in Gaza.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Because of this 
 it is absolutely necessary to reject, denounce, the repressive operation 
 de L'Aquila. We are all terrorists if they accuse themselves of terrorism i 
 Palestinian companions arrested in L'Aquila.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Furthermore, one 
 of political prisoners is the reason for the national campaign, 
 also international, existing to prevent it from being extradited.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The true 
 Terrorism are the bombs of imperialism!
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The terrorism of
Nazi character and reminiscent of genocide, the Holocaust, is that
of the State of Israel. This genocide of the State of Israel is
He is also under indictment at the Court of Justice in The Hague.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Condemn
Palestinians, even if it were true that their aim is to
Contributing to Palestinian resistance around the world, is like
to strike at those who developed resistance against Nazism and the
fascism in this country. Although the situations are extremely
the appeal to the fact that the Palestinians are the partisans of
This battle is a just and historically valid call. Therefore
the L'Aquila operation must fall and the mobilization for the
The liberation of these Palestinian brothers and sisters of ours must be extended
in all cities.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   This is 
 necessary because, like the Operation of L'Aquila is an operation 
 preventive, intimidative towards the entire movement, it is clear that a 
 prevention of repressive operations, prohibitions and persecutions that 
 can affect the Palestinian community, the supportive people in ours 
 country, it must be the same. So we are because in 
 particular in the events of this Saturday, in Milan as 
 elsewhere and in the period of new events that in all cities 
 Italian solidarity forces are promoting, is put big 
 evidence the request for liberation for the Palestinian companions 
 arrested in L'Aquila.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The level of 
 crime that develops by the state of Israel towards i 
 political prisoners. Today all the newspapers appear images 
 unequivocal of the doctors, who have been denuded, kept in the cold, 
 held naked prisoners. The title of the Manifesto, says: “Medici 
 abused ".
  </p>
  <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    That conduct 
 against the Palestinian people is a war, a war against a 
 whole people reminiscent of the worst pages of history 
 of humanity. As much as we all are aspiring to peace, it is necessary 
 consider that wars, as it was for Nazism, how it is 
 been for other historical episodes of this country, think of Vietnam, 
 Those who want peace must respond with the war, because only the 
 the right war, the war of peoples, can stop the march of the 
 wars, reactionary wars, antipopolar genocide, 
 imperialist.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    This does not apply
only in Palestine, it also applies in Ukraine, it applies in all scenarios
where the monster of war, the tendency towards a third world war,
it is developing and getting closer.

   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    War 
 world, the aggression wars of the peoples produce of 
 consequently a gigantic waste of money and funds for weapons, on 
 This I will speak briefly.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    World spending 
 In 2023 it increased for the ninth consecutive year in real terms, 
 A sum that approaches $ 2500 billion. The director 
 of the Sipri, the International Institute of Research on Peace of 
 Stockholm, he says that this expense will increase this year and for the 
 next years.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    The expense of 
 wars is bringing the war industries, the top players how they come 
 calls, widens in particular in Europe, the 345 business 
 billions of dollars and splash the wallets, organs of the greats 
 player, Il Sole 24 Ore of February 28 highlights the relationship between 
 war and profits, an organic, historical, structural relationship of 
 capitalist and imperialist production. Just looking 
 the trend of the drafts and taking into consideration the period from 
 January 2 to 26 February 2024, Il Sole 24 Ore publishes the 
 percentages of growth in the profits of the war industry. On the first 
 place there is the Rheinmetall, a German industry +394% of profits, 
 Then Saab, Leonardo is in third place.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    It is more than 
 justified, therefore, that in many realities have begun and yes 
 develop initiatives against Leonardo, the complaints. 
 Leonardo is the heart of the war industry in our country, 
 sting of the war economy in this country which is useless to repeat that they are billions spent on weapons and for the 
 war that counterbalance the money that is spent for the 
 health, school, work, in the face of wages that decrease 
 in our country also for the caravan, in the face of governments that 
 attack citizenship income, which deny the minimum wage e 
 then they push the population towards relative and absolute poverty 
 and in particular the poorest, less protected masses, in ours 
 country: over 5 million workers in our country are who 
 take wages from hunger, insufficient salaries not only for not 
 get to the end of the month, but which make a life almost impossible 
 decent.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    In the face of everything 
 This we have our governments, our states, which they fill 
 of money, of orders, the military industries and primarily the Leonardo, 
 our government like other governments in the world because the 
 military industries are global industries that sell weapons everywhere and 
 In all shapes and ways.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    So the 
 Leonardo as the heart of the war system is an industry that must 
 be more and more subject to initiatives of struggle, of denunciation, e 
 Not only of denunciation, in all large and small realities in this 
 village. In the new cycle of solidarity initiatives with the people 
 Palestinian will be necessary, precisely in order not to make only 
 repetitive and not only expressive of the feeling of solidarity 
 of our people, they must become more incisive, more targeted and 
 So even the Leonardo issue of the war industry must be 
 Very clear in the agenda of the next mobilization for Palestine.
   </p>
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    Leonardo is also a company run by government men
and the war industries.
   </p>
   <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Solidarity with 
 Palestine, fight against war and the war industry, with al 
 LEONARDO CENTRO, RELATIONSHIP between this situation and the more general 
 international situation, relationship between this situation and the 
 economic situation in our country, a relationship between this situation 
 and the worsening of the conditions of salary, work, schools, 
 of social services for popular masses.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Among all this 
 There is a link and this link must be highlighted in the 
 mobilization of all those who do not agree with this state 
 of existing things.
