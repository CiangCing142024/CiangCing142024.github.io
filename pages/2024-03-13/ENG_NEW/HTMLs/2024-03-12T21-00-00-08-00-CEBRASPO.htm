   Residents of different slums in the Monte Cristo neighborhood closed different roads in a protest during March 9, organized after the murder, two days earlier, from a young man in the Grota favela by civil police officers of the Special Resources Coordination (Core). Residents claim that the young man was unarmed.

   The protest concentrated residents of the Grota favelas, Chico Mendes, Sapé and other communities. Videos record huge barricades of fire on important roads in the region, such as Josué di Bernardi Avenue, Joaquim Nabuco and José Antonio Tonolli. The popular revolt in condemnation of police raids and murders in the communities began on the afternoon of 03/09 and continued until the dawn of 10/03.

The repression was not accepted by the protesters and there was confrontation. According to local press, a policeman was injured in his head after being hit by a stone.
