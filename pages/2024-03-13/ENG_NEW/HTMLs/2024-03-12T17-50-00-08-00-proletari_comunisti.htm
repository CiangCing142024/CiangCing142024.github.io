   Waiting for the event 
 unitary union of next April 12, so unitary that it puts together 
 The abbreviation of the Quadri Association are also listed, in an article by 
 Sole 24 hours of March 9, as well as naturally to Stellantis Mirafiori, the 
 Inductor companies in a crisis situation. An industrial crisis that is 
 aggravate and that, as mentioned in a regional council, in just over ten years 
 led to the loss of 40 thousand jobs.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  As for Mirafiori “that 
 It has about 12,000 workers in the entire area and 3200 in the bodywork 
 where the Maserati models and the electric Fiat 500 assemble: “For over 2200 
 employees a layoff procedure has been opened ... for the entire month 
 of March, prolonged until 20 April

 Next, and we move on to a single round. 
 A kind of general test, the workers' representatives say, for 
 Keep the plant at the minimum. "
 <o:p>
 </o:p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  To 40 thousand lost in these ten 
 years, therefore, now another 3000 could be added for the disputes 
 Open: “The disputes in the province of Turin are a dozen with 
 About 3 thousand risk employees "all in the automotive.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  There is the

 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  The whole, says a trade unionist 
 of Uilm, is “a worrying figure if inserted in a context in which Stellantis 
 is defining the production puzzle for the other Italian plants in the 
 Next years: after the pandina for Pomigliano until 2027, confirmation arrives 
 that the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio and Giulia will get to Cassino starting 
 respectively from 2025 and 2026, while Melfi remains focused on 
 Stla Medium platform. "
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Apart from the fact that the 
 "Confirm" for Cassino and Melfi must first materialize, but about 
 "Productive puzzle" Stellantis has already decided on the matter and without doubt 
 Compared to the factories in Brazil, for example, with an investment of 5.6 
 billions of euros and the launch of 40 new products, as well as in Argentina with 
 An investment of 370 million for the production of batteries (from the newspaper 
 of the masters of 7 March), and not to mention the billions in the United States ...
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Stellantis (which we remember has 
 declared 18.6 billion profits in 2023) enjoys the "policy 
 of the incentives ”put in place by almost all governments, while, at the same 
 time, in fact discharge, the "transition crisis" on workers and on 
 workers. In this sense, rather than asking for "help from institutions" for 
 resolve the "crisis", the workers must choose how to counter the plans of 
 General restructuring placed by the master.
