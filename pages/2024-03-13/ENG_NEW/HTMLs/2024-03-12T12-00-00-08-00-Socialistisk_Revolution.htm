   <em>
    New democracy
   </em>
  </a>
  <em>
   .
  </em>
 </p>
 <p p="">
  <p>
   First of all, the fact that revolutionary democratic movements put elections at the center of discussions in these times is one of the most obvious weaknesses of recent times. The election-centered discussion of the fundamental problems of the revolution essentially points to the hegemony of elections serving the ruling classes.
  </p>
  <p>
   As we have emphasized before, and as an opinion we should pay special attention to during this period, all choices, whether general or local, will largely unite the masses with the reactionary order; The rulers use the masses as filling material in their mutual power struggle; To hide disorganization and judge the people of lack of will by reducing popular administration to only choosing administrators and thus facilitating ideological hegemony of the people; Let's repeat that it serves to stifle the tendency to act with anger and reaction against the rulers for the sake of reform.
  </p>
  <p>
   From the past to the present, the revolutionary movement has assessed the election processes' politicizing function as a means of organizing by using legal opportunities. These processes are processes that provide important opportunities for agitation propaganda, which is a means of organizing the people in the ranks of the revolution. Therefore, it is not possible for revolutionaries to stay indifferent to these processes. In these processes, it is almost a necessity to determine a specific policy, to determine the reflections of the general line and the principles, to talk to his own words to the politicized masses and to explain the purpose and the way. To neglect and underestimate this ultimately means denying the role of masses in revolutions. For the revolution, the masses must be informed about the revolution. The main task of the electoral processes is to achieve this. The important thing is to bring the consciousness of the revolution to the masses, expand the possibilities of fighting the system and mobilize them to political power.
  </p>
  <p p="">
   <p>
    Therefore, no one in the public would even discuss the reality of the Communists' general assessment of the elections, let alone accept it. Almost everyone knows that elections in Turkey only serve to determine which clique of the ruling class will govern the 'national' parliament or the municipal council in particular. Although we know that these assemblies are unlikely to change order and realize the interests of the people, the public is prevented from having the income that these assemblies provide and using the funding and various opportunities that exist there. This is the main feature of parliamentary and local elections...
   </p>
   <p>
    Elections on this basis are based on deciding who should be in the administrations whose boundaries are determined by reactionary laws to comply with this order. It turns into an approval of the fascist order every time. It cannot be the attitude of the revolutionary movement to decide who the masses should prefer in the ongoing struggle for the same reactionary goals between the dominant clicks. Wherever it turns into this, our basic attitude should and will be to protest against the election and remain indifferent to this decision.
   </p>
   <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
    Increased number of attacks
   </h4>
   <p p="">
    <p p="">
     <p>
      Under the total attack that has continued since 2015, the bourgeois-feudal dictatorship now considers its fascist laws and even its constitution as a limiting factor. Intensive reactionism, which is particularly hostile to the Kurds everywhere and in every position, acts as an aggressive force in the region, including Iraq and Syria, and tries to strangle even the slightest requirement for rights in the country, has become a stable line. For us, this is an obligation to "show the origin". It is not a deviation from the Republic that some people think, but it is: the state almost without mask.
     </p>
     <p p="">
      <p>
       Local elections take place in such a political climate. The administrator's cane is used with experience and open threat. Elections that do not take place in a democratic environment are organized within the established rules with the approach that the resulting will will be unsurposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fascist dictatorship, with all its power, organizes these choices with a strong chauvinist campaign. The masses are surrounded, poisoned and shaped by political arguments such as hostility towards Kurds, "terrorism," nationality and localism "and hostility to false imperialism. In this image, all the chauvinist reflections caused by the disorganization of the surrounded people also strengthen the social chauvinist approaches. Social chauvinist trends gain influence among the masses against the AKP-MHP click, and the opposition, but chauvinist parties, are seen as the least evil in this election.
      </p>
      <p p="">
       <p>
        Reformism emerges in front of us with a political formation that is far from understanding the political nature of the process and seizing the real problems of the people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main problem for the masses, who are literally trapped under hunger, poverty and fascist oppression, is how they can handle daily life, rather than who should rule. The election and the debate over which party will prevail is a debate that the rulers are trying to create. The masses' expectation is never salvation. "No one" alternative is stronger, but the prerequisite for this alternative to become a material power is weak. After each election, stronger economic and political attacks are carried out by the fascist dictatorship. The needs of the masses are to reach the root of the contradictions, to expand their rights through independent action by elaborating on these contradictions and to enter a battle that will challenge the rulers. Choices, on the other hand, lead to the pacification of stricter contradictions, hinder the masses' quest for independent action and serves to elaborate the disorganization.
       </p>
       <h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left">
        The will of the people against the election game
       </h4>
       <p p="">
        <p>
         We once again urge all revolutionary forces to honor Partizan's mission and history in connection with the soil of the name 'Partizan' because of the opportunism and insidious existence of the well -known group. Partizan has an established line and principles that are understood by all revolutionary elements. Those deprived of these also lack the ability to represent it…
        </p>
        <p>
         We will act in the awareness that electoral relations and alliances that do not involve the organization and struggle of the people, negotiations based on winning mandates and consolidation of legalism by aiming at legal areas that should be tools are dangerous and leading to hindrance to the people's Fight for liberation.

          8.
         </strong>
         <strong>
          March belongs to those who fight for their rights, and not those who wait for their rights!
         </strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
         On March 8 this year, we women will again listen to the claims of the imperialist system and the reactionary male -dominated culture that great progress has been made to 'women's rights'. On the occasion of March 8, it will again be expressed on television, in parliaments, in seats, in stands and on international platforms, that women's freedoms from working life to social life and fundamental rights have been expanded and must be expanded. On March 8, they will celebrate "International Women's Day" with greater "enthusiasm" than we do, and they will keep talking about women's rights.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the one hand, they will tell us the lie of how great progress they have made with regard to women's rights, and on the other, they will hide the historical significance, the content and the essence of March 8. They will hide the class structure of the women's struggle for rights and freedom and pretend that it was those who gave women their rights.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we know what the truth is. On March 8, 1857, the bloody story of a strike is organized by 40,000 working women in New York to demand "an abbreviation of the 16-hour working day for 10 hours and equal pay for equal work." During the strike, thousands of workers were locked inside at the factory of the police with the support of the bosses, and 129 striking workers died in the ensuing flames. At the International Socialist Women's Conference in 1910, on March 8, on the proposal of Clara Zetkin, the working women's international match day, dedicated to the memory of the murdered strikers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality of the imperialist citizenship and all reactionary forces talking about women's rights by hiding March 8's class character that is ours is a completely different one. In dozens of semi -feudal, semi -colonial countries like Turkey, even our most basic rights are an oasis in the desert. The exercise of many fundamental rights such as the right to life, inviolability, freedom and security, establishment and travel freedom, freedom of thought and expression, financial freedom, the right to work and divorce and the right to engage in politics are rights that are both difficult, And when we see them, we women are murdered, subjected to violence, isolated and subjected to social pressure. In Turkey alone, 52 women were murdered for various reasons in January 2024. In countries such as India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the countries of the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Turkey are brutal violence and murder of women on the agenda.
        </p>
        <p p="">
         <p>
          The imperialists who are the enemies of the people and the working women can never hide their true face in the wars they are leading or provoking. In Palestine, the Zionist Israeli war machine performs a massacre that does not distinguish between children, women and the elderly. Women are the weak link in this cruelty. On the one hand, they are massacred with a merciless blockade, on the other, they are treated as "oppressed" objects in attempts at a ceasefire. To downplay the Palestinian resistance, the imperialists once again develop psychological warfare over women's bodies. In the figure with the "barbaric Palestinians", the women's problem is hypocritically used as a lever.
         </p>
         <p p="">
          <p>
           The imperialist system of its overdue capital, its degenerate culture, its hypocritical democracy, its structure, whose other characteristic is war, is the production center of all forms of reaction that reverberates women's rights and freedom and draws us into a vertebrae of male -dominated violence . Their alliances with the feudal forces of their semi -colonies are misogyne. The chauvinism, build -up and war policy that they promote in their own countries is also culturally based on male supremacy and nourishes misogyni. The honey they lubricate our mouths means that we are happy with what is available and accepts our fate. Which in turn would mean that we accept their utilizing, blood -sucking, women's hostile system, including male supremacy.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            We will not accept it. We will not submit to. We will not give way back from our fight.
           </strong>
           We will not settle for limited, symbolic rights. There will be no release of working women as long as the source of exploitation, violence, poverty, aggression and unfair wars does not dry out. We will fight our struggle with the awareness of complete liberation, not less. We will not lead our struggle with a liberal spirit, but with a revolutionary spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
           Therefore, March 8 is neither a simple "Women's Day" nor an instrument of capitalist consumer culture.
          </p>
          <p>
           8th March;
          </p>
          <p>
           -… is a call for battle against unfair imperialist wars.
          </p>
          <p>
           -… is a call for rebellion against the diverse exploitation and oppression of female workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           -… is a call to expand women's revolutionary organization and struggle in this process, where the exploitation is increased and 'slave laws' are introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
           -… is a call to fight all kinds of patriarchal culture, religious reaction and all forms of discrimination.
          </p>
          <p>
           – ... is a call to organize against state violence against communist, revolutionary and progressive women in dungeons, prisons and on the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
           As purple-red collectives, we will meet on March 8, working women's international match day, on streets and squares with all our enthusiasm, challenge

           In the square in the Kadıköy district of Istanbul and marched through the streets under the slogan "Fight against poverty, violence, exploitation and war". Several women's organizations participated in the march, including YDK. Slogans like »8. March is red, it will remain red 'and slogans in honor of revolutionary prisoners were shouted.
          </p>
          <p>
           A demand for the release of newly imprisoned political prisoners, including the Partizan reader Arzu Aksakal, was raised with the slogan "Let the dungeons be destroyed, freedom of the prisoners". The government's crimes associated with the landscape in 2023 were often condemned. Photographs of women murdered or disappeared during the earthquake, as well as women murdered as a result of patriarchal violence were carried around. The women's struggle in the workplace and the universities were also taken up, just as solidarity with those suffering from war and occupation around the world, and support for the Saturday mothers' struggle, which has required to know what has happened to those who are disappeared in the custody of the old Turkish state.

          <h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
           The burden of the world on our shoulders, the weaving workers in our memory, the struggle for freedom in our consciousness…
          </h3>
          <p>
           On March 8, 1857, 40,000 female weavers went on strike in New York, USA to demand "equal pay for equal work." In the fire that broke out under the strike, 129 female workers who were locked inside the factory lost their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 1850s were the years when the labor movement was on the rise in the United States. Industrial workers worked under unusually difficult conditions. Women led into the working class of the period and went on strike to demand a reduction of the 16-hour work day to 10 hours, correction of inhuman working conditions, an increase in wages and equal rights for female workers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Following this event, Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg, leaders of the Social Democratic Party in Germany, suggested at the Women of the Women in the 2nd International (International Socialist Women The proposal was accepted.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since then, women have fought for the demands made by the murdered weavers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The women continued to be inspired by this resistance story and walked the streets every 8 March despite all the pressure, the difficult conditions and the prohibitions. Throughout the world, women have fought and fight for their invisible, ignored and underpaid work. As in other countries, women in Turkey, Kurdistan and the Middle East on the streets are shouting their demands into the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today, women are sentenced to more poverty, which has been revealed by the deep economic crisis on a global scale, and they are slaughtered by the wars going on around the world. The paths of migration become the paths of death for women. If they are not on the roads, they are subjected to abuse such as harassment and rape beyond poverty where they live and they are killed in their homes, in the workplace and on the street as a result of men's violence.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today, the fascist AKP-MHP block, which represents the patriarchal state, is attacking constant women's claimed rights. These attacks have become even more ruthless following the cancellation of the Istanbul Convention, which was signed with the rising wave of women's struggle and rebellion. Women who are fighting for their rights are also exposed to all forms of violence by the patriarchal state.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this geography, as in Palestine and Rojava, poor people, mostly, become women and LGBTI+'are massacred in the wars that the imperialist capitalist system leads in search of markets.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the other hand, the patriarchal state and its representatives AKP-MHP's obvious massacre on workers and nature in Erzincan ̇liç will create serious problems in the region in the coming years. This massacre will put a new and heavy workload on the women's shoulders. Already today, women are concerned about their future in the region and wonder what they can do to ensure a healthier future for their children.
          </p>
          <p>
           We saw a similar situation when the Maraş earthquake developed on February 6 into a massacre of hundreds of thousands of people. Women were forced to carry very heavy burdens to survive, and they are still trying to survive in the earthquake zone by carrying burdens that become exponentially heavier.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the wars caused by the rulers, the burden is laid by the poor people, the burden of the massacre of nature and all living things through organic massacres, the burden of the massacre of people, nature and living things in the region through the earthquake, and the burden of poverty caused of the economic crisis also on the women's shoulders. Just as their work in the home is ignored, the value of the labor they create in workplaces and factories decreases day by day.
          </p>

But as for the Maoist losses, the figures from the old Indian state are being questioned today. In the Chhattisgarh district, the oppression of the Indian people has worsened, and there have been several reports of new false links between alleged Maoists and the oppression forces of the old Indian state. Villagers in the district point out that the alleged loss of Maoists that the Indian oppression forces have achieved are false,

In this way, it is possible to continue to terrorize the population, try to cut their relations with the Maoists and increase the official figures for guerrilla loss that the ancient Indian state gives up.

            In the past week, the situation has become very tense in Manipur. Armed clashes have been erupted in several districts at the same time, and there have also been several looting of weapons and mobilizations of different types.

            Tuesday night it was reported that a group of people in Imphal East plundered

            and got hold of about 200 weapons and 20,000 cartridges. There was also a shooting episode with the local forces where a soldier was killed and three others wounded. After this operation, the total number of looted weapons that have not been explained is around 4,000. Among the weapons looted on this occasion, there were military weapons, such as attack rifles such as Insas, AK, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            After this looting, the conflict broke out in

            , where on Thursday night there were two dead and dozens of wounded when people marched against the police station. The protesters condemned that a local police officer from Kuki has been fired to cooperate with armed groups, but when the same thing happened with Meitei agents, nothing happened. The protesters have pointed out the local oppression forces' cooperation with the Meitei militia. The protest was severely suppressed, and the inhabitants of Churachandpur have recorded how the Indian oppression forces attacked mobilization as if they were in a war zone, shooting with deadly ammunition and used explosives against the protesters.

            Following the vigorous oppression of the Indian troops, the protesters rightly attacked several of the oppressive forces' buildings, and several state buses were burned. After the violence, a total shutdown of the city's services and business was called on Friday, February 16. The conflict has continued and the forum for original tribal leaders (Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum (ITLF)) calls on

            When the old Indian state announces that it has pacified the situation or that "it has returned to normal," the conflict breaks out in many other places. The reality is that Manipur has not been pacified and will not be so far. The situation is still not under control despite the large number of troops that are posted there, namely
            <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/dont-just-watch-act-too-manipur-chief-minister-n-biren-singh-to-central-forces-4905468">
             60.000
            </a>
            . Even the Prime Minister of Manipur, N. Biren Singh, constantly urges the state's oppressive forces to act more determined. But since May, all this has been inadequate to stop the protests and the righteous struggle of the people in Manipur.

            The comrades who sent us this information wrote the following: In February 2024, a large -scale wall writing appeared in Delhi in support of the new Democratic Revolution in India. Delhi, the capital of the ancient Indian state and the center of the white power, is the stronghold of the ruling Comador-bureaucratic bourgeoisie and the landlord classes. Even in the stomach of the beast and the center of the reaction, the sparkle of the new democratic revolution continues in symphony with the People's War in the countryside, even in times of the utmost reactionary violence against the masses, led by the Brahmanian Hindutva fascism in the ancient Indian state.

            </em>
            Maoist Communist Center of India (MCCI)) and led extensive land battles in the state of Bihar after McCI leader com. Kanhai Chatterjee. Mishra was responsible for Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, after McCi merged with IKP ML (People's War) and formed IKP (Maoists) in 2004. Even the Yankee Imperialists noticed him during this period and mentioned him in their land reports about terrorism in 2006. He was arrested by the Indian state in 2008 but was acquitted and released in 2017. He was arrested again in August 2023. Hem Mishra, who studied Chinese at Jawaharlal Nehru University, was a popular cultural activist in Revolutionary Cultural Front (

His activism raised awareness of the Indian state's genocide war against people in Bastar, especially against the Adivasi farmers, the imperialist plunder of India's natural resources and the semi-feudal violence that prevails in Indian society. He was arrested in 2013 accused of being "courier" for the Maoists and is still imprisoned.

Like the previous Operation Green Hunt, SAMADHAN-Prahar and the Surajkund offensive will be defeated by the Indian masses and their vanguard, the Communist Party of India (Maoists), under the banner of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism.

            On Wednesday, February 21, the farmer Shubh Karam Singh, who protested with thousands of other peasants, was shot by the reactionary Indian police in the Jind district of Haryana.

            For this, and Punjab's main minister, Bhagwant Mann, shamefully tried to buy the family and peasants by announcing that he will give them compensation of 10 million rupees, equivalent to $ 120,000. At the same time, the Indian police declared that the cause of death would only be known after the autopsy, and thus they avoided any fault themselves.

            The cowardly murder of Shubh Karam Singh is not an isolated case, but the oppression of the old Indian state has been very harsh since the beginning of the protests. The use of tear gas, concrete barricades that protect the country's capital, and heavy police attacks have been normal this week with peasant protests. In addition, the old Indian state has also launched its entire propaganda and censorship machinery. Punjabs peasants are accused of being infiltrated or having

Farmers' organizations held several protests against police oppression and burned depictions of Modi, Amit Shah and the minister of the chief of Haryana, and there have been new wounded peasants due to police brutality. They have also announced new mobilizations, including a tractor march on Monday, February 26.

We see that the government is using brutal methods of oppression such as building concrete blockades, shoping tear gas from drones, large -scale use of shock grenades, shotguns and now live bullets against farmers trying to reach Delhi to protest their 12 -point demands.

            We believe that these oppressive military tactics, which were previously seen in conflict zones such as Bastar and Kashmir, against the democratic right of people to protest and make their demands, are very harmful to the democratic space in the country and should be counteracted to regain our democratic as well as both as constitutional rights.

            Campaign against state oppression, a coalition of over 40 organizations, has called for a protest against Haryana Police's brutal behavior, shooting with tear gas and shock grenades, use of shotguns and murder of Shubhkaram Singh and other protesting farmers. We are very concerned that our protest has been reclaimed by Delhi's police to suppress the people's demands for democratic rights against the state's oppression. The protesters have been brutally detained and female protesters have been abused by male officers. Sharda Dixit, former school principal for the entire India Red Education Committee, is severely wounded and unconscious. Nearly 25 protesters, including students, lawyers and professors such as Professor Nandita Narain and Professor N Sachin, have been detained.
           </p>
           <p>
            We believe that the Indian state led by the Brahmanian Hindutva fascist BJP-RSS by erecting a concrete blockade and using the aforementioned funds to prevent farmers from protesting against their downfall in the hands of the state and corporate, openly reveals its militaristic and fascist nature , as patriotic, democratic -minded and justice -loving people have to resist.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important to point out that farmers are protesting against the imperialist aggression against our country in the form of the WTO, for the just demands for MSP, forgiveness of farmers' loans and securing the rights of tribal peasants over their land, water and forest, among many other demands. These demands are answered by militarised force, as we see in Bastar, where drones are used to drop bombs on people, and in Kashmir, where pellets are used against people of oppressed nationalities. Such militarized repression is very worrying for the future of the country and requires immediate attention from the people of the country and the world.

            Rona Wilson is one of the activists sitting behind bars in the BK16 case because of her activism and anti-fascist intervention. …
           </p>
           <p>
            To question Indian democracy is not new to Rona, as his activism around political prisoners is centered around the undemocratic nature of the "anti-terror" law in India. Rona helped establish committees for release of political prisoners (
            <em>
             red. –
            </em>
            Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP)) and acts as PR secretary for the organization. …
           </p>
           <p>
            Together with the famous author and activist Arundhati Roy, Rona was also a member of the committee for defense and release of G.N. Saibaba and has worked on the issue of political prisoners since the early 2000s. …
           </p>
           <p>
            Rona was arrested from her home in Delhi on June 6, 2018, along with four other activists on the same day – Sudhir Dhawale, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut and Shoma Sen. All five were accused of having links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoists) and charged under various sections of the UAPA. But the state had especially targeted Rona Wilson...
           </p>
           <p>
            National Investigation Board (
            <em>
             red. –
            </em>
            National Investigation Agency (NIA)) has accused Rona of trying to create turmoil in India as they have seized some documents from him talking about how oppressed groups such as Dalites and Muslims should come together to form an antifascist unit front to strengthen the mass mobilization of people. For this reason, police appointed Rona to conspire to murder Prime Minister Narendra Modi, based on the police's claims of finding a letter among Rona's possessions…
           </p>
           <p>
            Several years after his unfair arrest, Arsenal Advice analysed the electronic copies of co-defendants Rona's and Surendra's computers at the request of the defence. Arsenal Consulting (a Massachusetts-based digital forensics company) had stated that an attacker used malware to infiltrate Wilson's laptop and deposited at least ten incriminating letters on it. These included an alleged letter to a Maoist militant discussing the need for weapons and ammunition and even calling on the banned group to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
           </p>
           <p>
            A year later, the Washington Post released a report that revealed that Rona was the target of two different groups of hackers before he was arrested. … ModifieDelephant, the primary hacker, sent emails with documents or attachments-filled with commercially available malware such as Netwire and Darkcomet-tailored to the victim's interests and were often copied to several recipients they knew, Sentinelone said. Wilson received at least 32 emails from ModifieDelephan, and Gadling was a recipient of 40 such emails from the group.
           </p>
           <p>
            … Three independent experts in the US and Europe reviewed the Sentinelone report at The Post's request and joined its conclusions. It is worrying that researchers say the earliest attack on Wilson can be traced back to a decade ago, even though the email attacks intensified in 2014 and continued until at least 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            … The state has painted him like that, just as they have painted those who fight against injustice, for hope, as terrorists, as anti-national. The question is still - if nation? In a country that is a prison for nationalities itself, do we have to accept the state's agenda to establish a Hindu Rashtra? Should we accept a 'nation' built on the blood of Muslims, adivasis, oppressed throws, women and other oppressed groups? Should we accept a nation that throws its most patriotic, land -loving people in prison for having a voice, albeit one who speaks to the people, about their demands, instead of the state's chauvinist and reactionary agenda? No, we can't accept that as a country. We can accept nothing but an unconditional release of friend Rona and of all political prisoners who are struggling selflessly for us.

                 It has also been the general trend throughout India since the Brahmanian Hindutva fascism made its way after BJP's victory in 2014, and it has been particularly intensified after the arrests in the Bhima Koregaon conspiracy case. The state is trying to establish a narrative and lay the foundations of several Bhima Koregaon-like conspiracy cases across India by bringing the idea that the very existence of political democratic disagreement is equal to naxalism. Prime Minister Narendra Modi even declared in Surajkund Chintan Shivir in 2022 that "any kind of naxalism, whether with pen or gun, must be eradicated."

                 The Philippine Army's 3rd Infantry Division is determined to call its military oppression campaign against the population of Negro's island for a state of "stable inner peace and security". Negrosanon's condemns this false statement strongly.

                 What mercenaries and reactionary state forces call "security" drive peasants, farm workers and indigenous peoples from the countryside, coastal fishermen and the urban poor using sheer force or political manoeuvres by bureaucratic capitalists to make way for foreign and local ruling class interests such as mining, ecotourism, commercial plantations, quarries, real estate, reclamation projects and mega-dam projects. Their protection of exploiters and oppressors should not be called SIPS, but 'sipsip' or fattening for their masters for their own gain.

                 All five guerrilla fronts in the Apolinario Gatmitan Commando-NPA Negros Island Regional Operations Command (AGC-NPA), under the absolute lead of the Filipinos' Communist Party (CPP), work with renewed strength to launch armed battle, implement agricultural revolution and build mass base and bodies for political power . Revolutionary mass organizations also continue to arouse, organize and mobilize farmers, women, adolescents and other marginalized sectors in the countryside through anti-imperialist, anti-feudal and anti-fascist campaigns. A thousand threads tie the NPA and the masses together, and the invincible link that binds them together is still expanded and consolidated in the hidden, even with the presence of the fascist AFP.

                 Reactionary state forces cannot dismantle the collective awareness of the exploited and oppressed masses to overthrow a rotten semi -colonial and half -feudal system, and the reasons for fighting grow every single day.

                 The prolonged stagnation and crisis of the dying global capitalist system has resulted in an escalation of the US-led interimperialist deputy wars, especially in Ukraine and Palestine. The crisis in the semi -colonial and semi -feudal system in the Philippines continues to worsen. The Philippines suffers from greater poverty and distress due to bureaucratic corruption and social injustice under the American Marcos II regime. But the people continue to resist, organize and make revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Against this background, we celebrate today, February 17, 2024, 52nd anniversary of the founding of Christians for national liberation (

                 We greet and give the highest tribute to our CNL revolutionary martyrs and heroes who selflessly sacrificed their lives in the fight and revolution. Their blood was shed and sacrificed to nourish and flourish CNL and the national democratic revolution with a socialist perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On this date, we also remember the Martyri of the Three Filipino Priests 152 years ago - the fathers Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora, known as Gomburza, triggering the Philippine Revolution in 1896, which crushed three centuries of dominance of Spanish colonialism in our country .
                </p>
                <p>
                 Like gold tested in fire, the CNL has stood firm on its Christian revolutionary stance and practice for more than five decades with full and vigorous participation in the struggle of the Filipino people for national liberation and democracy with a socialist perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Since its founding in 1972, CNL has successfully held nine national congresses and made calls and plans to strengthen the organization and help promote the revolution. CNL's principles, practice, organization and strategic program have been claimed, confirmed and practiced throughout the years. It has stopped establishing and activating itself across the country as a revolutionary political underground organization of Christians and church people as part of the overall revolutionary mass movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hundreds of CNL members act as revolutionary catalysts in the Christian churches and communities in the different regions and areas of the country. They help to build and promote the revolutionary armed struggle in the countryside. Many CNL members have since volunteered to help directly prepare and maintain guerrillazons, build bases and promote the Agrare Revolution.

                </p>
                <p>
                 CNL has actively participated in the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, anti-fascist mass movement to combat the ultra-reactionary plans from the subsequent US-backed regimes under Marcos Sr., Cory Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, Macapagal-Arroyo, Aquino , Duterte and Marcos Jr. It has also helped to fight the colonial, feudal and fascist culture and promote national and scientific culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                 CNL's members are always aware of the limits of the reactionary institutions they operate in, but strive to lead the struggle for democratic reforms within the churches at all levels, counteract the reactionary trends and promote the progressive tendencies and bring the power and resources of the churches to it to it The Side of the National Democratic Revolution. This includes international work, especially with the presence of CNL formations in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific area.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In all this, CNL recognizes lacks and challenges that need to correct and overcome to promote the revolution. This includes correcting subjectivism in the form of empiricism, which is driven by bourgeois and petty -bourgeois thinking and actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We therefore continue to consolidate and expand our membership throughout the country in order to achieve broad, dynamic and vibrant participation and support, primarily for the armed struggle. This is reinforced and supplemented by anti-imperialist, anti-fascist, anti-feudal mass movements, parliamentary struggle and peace negotiations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We dare to fight, dare to win.

                 A unit from New Folk Army (NPA) -Central Negros completed a week-long political-military basic course on 20-27. January last year. The purpose of the activity was to equip the red warriors with basic political-military principles so that they can bravely resist Marcos regime's strategic counter-revolutionary campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The unit conducted training in the middle of intensified military operations on the guerrilla front. Tight coordination and cooperation between the red fighters and commanders, and the unwavering mass support for the unit's financial, financial and security needs were the key to a successful and safe conduct of the exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to Ka Monique, a red warrior participates, "it really is better when you exercise because you are not afraid to meet the enemy, especially when you consider that it is part of our central duty as a army."
                </p>
                <p>
                 The unity's revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the armed struggle also served to inspire the warriors, they said. Training is also part of the guerrilla territor's efforts to overcome the ideological, political and organizational weaknesses that prevent extensive progress for the folk war in their area of responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to KA Turko, political-military training like this one helps "avoiding a purely military thinking or being militaristic ... to be good military is to be good at politics." He is the division manager for the unit and served as a primary training instructor.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The training lasts a week is based on the syllabus for a longer course that lasts a month. It was abbreviated to accommodate the long -term siege operations of the state armed troops. Some of the activities on the course were regular morning exercises, basic formation commands such as exercise, march and weapon manual as well as combat formation and military maneuvers in various fighting scenarios.

                 Revolutionary priests, nuns and church people celebrated on February 17, the 52nd anniversary of Christians for National Liberation (CNL). On the occasion of their anniversary, CNL's national leadership called on all its members in the country, in Europe, North America and Asia-Stophav area: “Right up to weaknesses, consolidation and expand our ranks! Defeat the American Marcos II regime! Expeding People's War! "
                </p>
                <p>
                 With their anniversary, the group also commemorated the 152nd anniversary of the martyrdom of three Filipino priests, Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora, collectively known as Gomburza. They were murdered by the Spanish colonialists and were one of the catalysts for the revolution of 1896 that ended Spain's colonization of the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On this occasion, "we salute and give the highest honor to our revolutionary martyrs and heroes who selflessly sacrificed their lives for the struggle and revolution," the group said.
                </p>
                <p>
                 CNL has held nine national congresses, presenting its programs and plans to strengthen the organization and promote the revolution. CNL launched its 9th Congress in September 2022, where it adopted CNL's template program.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "Hundreds of CNL members serve as revolutionary initiators of change in Christian churches and societies in different regions and areas of the country," according to CNL. They say they help build and promote the revolutionary armed struggle in the countryside. The group also stated that many of their members voluntarily help directly prepare and maintain guerrillazons, build bases and promote the agricultural revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 From the reactionary institutions in which they operate, CNL also leads the struggle for democratic reforms within churches at all levels, and oppose reactionary trends and promote progressive changes within them. CNL says they are also trying to bring the power and resources of churches to the side of the national democratic revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 "In light of these, CNL recognizes the weaknesses and challenges it has to correct and overcome to promote the revolution," it says. The group says that among those it must overcome is subjectivism in the form of empiricism derived from bourgeois and petty -bourgeois ideas and practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the new year, CNL promised to strive to consolidate and expand membership throughout the country to primarily support the armed battle and at the same time lead the anti-imperialist, anti-fascist and anti-feudal mass movement.

                  The Communist Party of the Philippines

                </p>
                <p>
                 February 24, 2024
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) condemns the fascist US-Marcos regime, the Army forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP) for the massacre of five captured revolutionaries in Bilar, Bohol yesterday, and assigns the demand for justice for Domingo Compoc, Hannah Cesista, Parlito Historia, Marlon Omosura and Alberto Sancho.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The five were all caught alive and taken into custody yesterday morning by the fascist criminal troops from the 47th Infantry Battalion and the Bohol police in Sitio Matin-Ao 2, Barangay Campagao, Bilar, Bohol. They were exposed to coarse torture and then murdered with cold blood.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There is no truth in the lie that police spread that the five were killed in a fight. Local residents confirm that there was no meeting that morning. What people witnessed was the brutal combat troops of the military and police that tortured and killed the five revolutionaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A picture taken in the alley shows Compoc, with his arms apparently tied on the back, in custody of a soldier from the Armed Forces of Philippines (AFP) after being harassed by the military and police. This image is currently circulating among the people of Bohol and on social media.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Compoc, which was in the 60s, suffered from arthritis and was unable to fight. He was subjected to serious torture in front of a number of people in the village in the hope of putting a horror in life on them. Based on the facts that were originally collected in the area, Ka Silong was chopped to death with deadly wounds on the neck and abdomen.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cesista, on the other hand, a young lawyer from Cebu, who chose to serve the peasant masses and their revolutionary movement in Bohol, were thrown onto the ground by the soldiers and forced to lie and crawl in the mud before she was finally shot to death.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The intentional killing of Compoc, Casista, Historia, Omosura and Sancho, after being taken prisoner and put into the custody of the military and police, is a serious violation of international humanitarian law. 47. Ib and Bohol Police, the management of AFP and PNP and Marcos themselves are responsible for war crimes and must be prosecuted and punished for their criminal deeds.
                </p>

                 Further details are being collected about how the others were tortured and killed in the same way. An autopsy of the remains of the victims of the Bohol massacre performed by independent pathologists will certainly add more details to the first facts that have been bravely presented by the local community and help to solve the cruel crime committed by the military and the police.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The first details of local witnesses contradict the "results" of the so -called "crime unit" of the Philippine national police, which are in charge of the criminals of the police and the military who shamelessly cover the crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The party calls on the Filipino people, peasant associations, unions, youth groups, lawyers, media, church people, women and others to unite and stand with the families, friends and loved ones to the victims of Bohol massacre in their demands for justice. The party and new folk army will promise to do everything they can to punish the fascist and terrorist criminals.

                <p>
                 The massacre in Bohol is just the latest in a series of fascist crimes committed by the AFP and PNP during their desperate campaign to end the armed resistance of the Filipino people. Notably, the 47th IB is also responsible for the killing of Manuel 'Loloy' Tinio on April 4, 2023 in Ubay, Bohol, and Arthur Jasper Lucenario on May 14, 2023 in San Miguel, Bohol.
                 <br/>
                 By committing these fascist crimes, only the Marcos regime and AFP further succeed in increasing the Filipino people to resort to weapons and join the new folk army to fight for their rights and promote their case for social justice by using State terrorism shows The American Marcos regime, which is why the revolutionary armed resistance of the people is fair and necessary, and why it is the only opportunity for the people, especially the peasant masses, in their struggle for a real land reform.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The people and especially the majority of the peasant masses in Bohol have no choice but to rise for resistance and fight back with weapons. In Bohol, the land is still in the hands of a few large landlords, large bourgeois compradors and large foreign companies. Most of the peasants are peasant farmers and oppressed and suffer from gross forms of exploitation, financial distress and hunger. They are deprived of their land by large oil palm plantations and ecotourism projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Communist Party of the Philippines and the revolutionary movement paid tribute to Domingo Compoc, Hannah Cesista, Parlito Historia, Marlon Omosura and Alberto Sancho at the highest. They are the Heroes of the Philippine people who gave up all the comforts to serve the oppressed and oppressed masses. Their contribution to the Filipino people's case will never be forgotten.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Inspired by Francisco Dagohoy's heroism, which led Bohol's resistance for more than eight decades from 1744 to 1829 against the Spanish colonial forces, the farmers in Bohol are with the rest of the Philippine people's oppressed and exploited masses, under the party's leadership, determined to rise And fight with weapons, no matter how long it takes to promote the fight for national democracy towards a complete victory.

                 The head of the Filipino's Armed Forces (AFP), General Romeo Brawner JR, boasted of his confidence that the overall victory over the "NPA remains" in Visayas will be achieved by the end of 2024. But the brutal and sweeping massacre of five hors they Combat in Bohol performed by 47. Ib and PNP and the bombardment of the craving kal range in Escalante metropolis, including the murder of Jose Caramihan, an ordinary farmer, shows AFP's and the police's dirty and cruel behavior to publicly manifest the false success of their rebel campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With AFP's repeated postponement of the deadline to do away with NPA, it is clear that Brawner and his commander Marcos Jr. not want to admit the defeat of their plan to destroy the revolutionary movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                 NPA can never be destroyed. The justice of a folk war that is waged with the unwavering support of the masses has been proven in the more than 55 years NPA has existed under the leadership of the Filipinus Communist Party (CPP). As long as the rotten semi -colonial and semi -feudal system exist, more people will oppose and be willing to sacrifice their lives in the armed revolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In this connection, Apolinario Gatmitan Commando-Ny Folkehær Negros Island Regional Operations Command (AGC-NPA), along with all guerrilla fronts on the island, will be the largest tribute to Domingo Compoc (ka Silong or commonly known by the masses in Negros as KA Laser) and Alberto Sancho (Ka Juaning), which was among the five red warriors brutally massacred by elements of the 47th infantry battalion from the Philippine Army and troops from the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Sitio Matin-Ao 2, Barangay Campagao, Bilar, Bohol Province on February 23rd.
                </p>
                <p>
                 According to witnesses, no meeting took place in the aforementioned area. Ka Laser and Ka Juaning and the other three comrades were still alive when they were taken prisoner by the mercenaries and police. Ka laser suffered from arthritis and had no ability to resist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Instead of respecting the rights of the five red soldiers as prisoners of war, they were subjected to torture by the butchers of 47. Ib and PNP. They were forced to roll themselves in the mud and were shot to death except Ka Laser. He was stabbed in the throat and his stomach was cut up, causing his death. There are clear violations of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and Supplementary Protocol 1 from 1977.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The masses at Negros greatly appreciated KA Laser and Ka Juaning. They became part of the growth of the revolutionary movement on Negro's island.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ka Laser came from Bohol province and has long been carrying out revolutionary work in his area since the 1980s. In 2007, he was deployed to southeastern Negros and then to southwest Negros in 2015. Later, he was redeployed to Bohol in 2017 as platoon leader and deputy secretary of the Bohol Provincial Committee.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Before KA Laser was posted to Negros, he contributed significantly to the development of a guerrillazone in Bohol. He helped with the breakthrough of the agricultural revolution during other major remedy movement (
                 <em>
                  red. –
                 </em>
                 Second Great Rectification Movement (Sgrm)), including the increase in the production share in favor of the tenants. He also greatly contributed to strengthening the underground mass organizations in Bohol.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ka Laser was also known for its role in tactical offensives in Bohol. The most notable tactical offensive he was involved in was attacked in 1999 at 7th PNP-Regional Mobile Group Camp Support Coy (RMG-CSC) Headquarters in Barangay Rizal, Batuan, Bohol, which was performed without a single shot where NPA seized 80 M16 rifles, an M60 masking gun and a 60 mm mortar.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Meanwhile, Ka Juaning helped with the mass legal movement in early 2010 in Negros Oriental and engaged as a full-time NPA fighter later that year.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ka Juaning has been active in the mass struggles among the poor in the cities since the 1980s. In 1987, he was captured by reactionary state forces because he supported the armed partisans. He was sentenced in 1994 and brought to National Bilibid prison (
                 <em>
                  red. –
                 </em>
                 National Bilibid Prison (NBP)). He was among those who joined SGRM and helped strengthen the political prisoners' position in NBP. After his release from the prison in the latter part of the 1990s, Ka Juaning returned to work in the mass movement in Cebu.
                </p>
                <p>
                 AFP and PNP must be held accountable for their abominable crime in slaughtering the five red fighters. The butchers in the military and police are wrong in their belief that NPA will be weakened by their methods of performing massacres and then terrorist terror, either in Visayas or throughout the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Revolutionary martyrs such as Ka Laser and Ka Juaning who sacrificed their lives serve as inspiration for red fighters and the whole revolutionary movement. Their revolutionary spirit will live on in our persistent struggle for the democratic revolution of the people so that the people can achieve a future with true peace and liberation.
