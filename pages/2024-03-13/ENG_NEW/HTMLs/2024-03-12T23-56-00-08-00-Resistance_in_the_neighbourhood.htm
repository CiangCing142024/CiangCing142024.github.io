  Recently, a trade union and political persecution industry has been opened against teachers. All over the country are utilized all administrative and judicial mechanisms to find militant teachers to find hostages in disciplinary and courtrooms. Various reactionary provisions of the Civil Service Code are utilized as well as the anti -union legal framework passed in recent years (Chatzidakis, Georgiadis Laws, etc.)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Specifically there are:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  · 4 persecutions (disciplinary and criminal) for participating in the mobilization of ELME Piraeus (with ADEDY workstation) against PISA exams.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  · 2 criminal and disciplinary persecution of teachers for "inappropriate out -of -service behavior", due to participation in mobilizing the anniversary of the murder of 15 -year -old Grigoropoulos, based on (junta inspiration) prohibitions in the pandemic.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  · 3 Criminal Persecution of Teachers for the Mobilization of ELME Piraeus against the Piraeus Piraeus Fiesta-Fiasko in favor of private schools and for mobilization of the Association at the Piraeus GRN offices. In this lawsuit made by the Piraeus Piraeus, he is also the president of the Piraeus Labor Center, who participated and supported the mobilization.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  · 2 disciplinary proceedings (referral from the Piraeus GGM) for "malicious criticism of the Head Authority", on the occasion of public (!) Criticism in the policies of the Ministry.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  · 1 Primary Primary Education Prosecution in Thessaloniki for participating in mobilizations against auctions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ; .
  <br/>
  <br/>
  · 3 References to Disciplinary Regional Education in Athens for their participation in the educational associations strike-by-law by mentors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Among all this at times colleagues are called to apology to the training departments for written explanations, are threatened with SAD, are called to police departments because they participated in a strike (Rethymnon).
  <br/>
  <br br=""/>
  <br/>
  It is a fact that all these persecutions are part of the overall blow to the action of unions, the right to demonstration, strike and mobilization.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It is not only about persecuted but all workers, youth, the people who want to resist policies that hit and dismantle rights in work, education, health.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  After two meetings- with the participation of trade unions and movements- neighborhood colleges and movements- that took place (22/2 and 27/2) we took the initiative to organize information campaign against the prosecutions and implementation
  <b>
   Demonstrations on Thursday 21/3 at 18:30 at PIRAEUS MUNICIPAL THEATER Square.
  </b>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">
