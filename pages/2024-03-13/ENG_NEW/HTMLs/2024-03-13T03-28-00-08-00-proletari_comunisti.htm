  It is certainly not peace on the agenda but it is politics 
 of the increase in military expenditure. In these days the newspapers 
 They report news of new funding for strategic autonomy 
 of the European imperialism that translates into other passages, in 
 Other war plans by imperialist governments of Europe 
 which are only needed to feed the fire of the clash 
 military in progress against Russia in particular.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Governments and the 
 same European institutions speak of common defense but the unit of 
 intent that reach the various imperialist countries is only transitory 
 Because the interests of individual countries are different and conflicting 
 European imperialists, France, Germany and Italy above all, at the basis of the division of the world.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now, also for 
 the approach of the European elections and the election campaign in 
 USA, the question of the armaments race returns to be 
 agitated with more strength by the political leaders of European parties and by 
 Masters of arms who, in these days, have presented the new guidelines of the 
 strategy for the defense industry through the commission 
 European.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The war in 
 Ukraine requires a continuous flow of weapons by the 
 Imperialists and Zelenskj repeats him at all his visit, a continuous 
 need for weapons and ammunition to face the war potential 
 Russo who is growing as regards the ammunition, 
 As reported by the owners' newspapers, and for imperialist countries 
 Europeans The problem is not to take action for peace but 
 Continue to feed winds of war, create all the premise 
 for a new carnage in Europe, as explicitly says the 
 same von der Leyen: "Europe prepare for war in 
 Next five years because, it is unlikely, but not impossible ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The race to 
 rearrange for European defense, the war economy behind which 
 The enormous profits of the arms industries, blessed by their business bags are hidden, are themes of the campaign 
 election certainly, even if the financial resources that Europe 
 In this case it available for the weapons industries is 
 unsolved but the meaning is however to give an indication for 
 make the profits of the industries of the 
 Weapons, because this infinite war certainly convenient for them.

  Recently there is 
 State Macron, his government is representative of a Member State 
 of the UN Security Council and nuclear and colonial power, 
 who made the proposal of an deployment of troops born in 
 Ukraine and then continued Scholz representative of a government 
 who has increased the military expenditure of his country by overcoming the roof 
 of 2% (to be precise 2.1%) of military expenditure with respect to 
 Gross domestic product (GDP), the latter objective set in 
 Born area to increase the military power of the alliance 
 Atlantic, representative of a government who, together with the United Kingdom and 
 France - to which from his direct and indirect contribution also 
 Italy of the Meloni government -, is present on the field in Ukraine 
 not only with mercenaries but also with professional officers for 
 Fight and train to use long -range weapons that come back 
 useful in addressing them against Russia, thus feeding the escalation 
 Bellica.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Also drones, 
 plane-radar and electronic war of different allied air force 
 they often fly just outside the Ukrainian airspace to help the 
 Kiev forces to hit objectives in Crimea and Russia avoiding 
 official involvement in the conflict.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  London has 
 another 2.5 billion for military aid to Ukraine in Ukraine 
 2024 (after 2.3 billion both in 2022 and in 2023), Berlin promises 
 8 billion only this year (has just inaugurated a new factory 
 of ammunition in low Saxony), France provides cannons, system 
 of aerial defense, missiles and pilots training.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A huge flow 
 of money flows to help the puppet of NATO and his government of 
 Nazis, to the oligarchs in power in Ukraine and recently the EU has 
 approved in January 50 billion on 4 years of economic aid (the 
 World Bank has calculated that Ukraine will need 450 
 billions of euros for reconstruction). Profits on profits.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But not only help 
 Cheap, as you know, weapons are a constant.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In the recent 
 Report of the European Network against the weapon trade, ENAT, from 
 War Lobby to War Economy, in which 536 were reconstructed 
 meetings between representatives of the main companies in the sector 
 European and members of the Commission between 2014 and 2023 and 175 
 Meeting with MEP between 2019 and 2023. “The pressures of the 
 military industry lobby also on the EU Commission are 
 continuous and relevant ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The European defense 
 It is the appeal of the Commission aimed at the masters of weapons in 
 Europe to increase production and governments to increase spending 
 military.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Commission 
 European provides for "mobilizing 1.5 billion in the EU budget for the 
 period 2025-26 to continue improving competitiveness " 
 of industry and defense technology. In itself it is one 
 negligible figure, it is calculated that with 1.5 billion the EU could 
 finance the purchase of just 58 Leopard 2. But, he explains 
 Borrell, «The bottom is an incentive to invest, not for 
 replace states ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A project, 
 According to the commissioner for the internal market and the services, Breton, 
 which initially needs 100 billion (in Eurobond) to arrive 
 to a turning point. But of that money, in the new EU plan, there is no 
 trace.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The weapons 
 they could be purchased by a consortium of European countries 
 sponsored by the Commission with the same model that was adopted 
 For anti-covid vaccines and, especially for ammunition that are the 
 more urgent chapter of the supplies in Kiev, they could 
 Use the funds of the Russian oligarchs frozen by the sanctions 
 after the start of the aggression to Ukraine. For the rest, at 
 more expenses for purchases of war material should be done 
 in front of the same way that the Next Generation EU was created 
 And to the PNRRs: the creation of European debt. Then a new war thrust downloaded on the masses, on the workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Borrell remember 
 that "the European defense industry has already increased by 50% 
 His abilities », but" we must go further ». «In 2022 - he adds 
 The high represented - the investments in the defense were 
 58 billion euros divided between the twenty -seven. In the USA the Pentagon 
 He asked for investments for 215 billion euros ».
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today, 78% 
 of the European acquisitions in the defense sector come from 
 countries outside the European Union. Edis (European strategy for 
 The industrial defense sector) aims to encourage Europeans a 
 work cooperatively and to invest jointly in the 
 skills built in Europe. Invites Member States to buy 
 At least 40% of military equipment collaboratively - 
 that is, without weighing their feet with each other - and 50% 
 within the EU by 2030, reaching 60% by 
 2035. To do this, the Commission intends to facilitate and support 
 Joint programs using multiple funding and tools 
 regulations, which are based on the strengthening of the European industry 
 of the defense through the law on common contracts (Edirpa) and the 
 law in support of the production of ammunition (ASAP).
 </p>
 <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Must 
 Mention that in the meantime, participation in European military missions 
 has already been underway for some time and this "common defense" is invoked 
 by the imperialists while they hide each of them the dagger behind 
 The back ready to launch it to competing imperialism. 
 They converge tactically but the political and economic interests there 
 they bring on a collision course, today they come together on Ukraine, medium 
 East, a peaceful nature for a power policy of imperialism 
 European, in reality a European imperialism that is made up of various 
 Imperialist countries whose strength relationships remain in balance 
 more and more precarious.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   To push for 
 coordinate the skills of member countries in defense development 
 In particular, the governments of Estonia, France and Poland, 
 signatories of an appeal that relaunches the military defensive capacity 
 continental. Among these countries Poland is engaged in a 
 massive rearmament program, buy American, British weapons and 
 South Koreane, certainly not European. And this is already a contradiction 
 whose solution points the European Commission.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Two years 
 from the beginning of the war in Ukraine the wars and threats of 
 war are increased, humanity is constantly threatened 
 from imperialist policies.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   The complex 
 military-industrial and ministers are one-and in Italy 
 Minister Crosetto represents in a too evident way 
 this union - and the industry of the 
 defense, the financial sector and the academic world, a topic 
 which unequivocally demonstrates that the goal of peace does not 
 can be reached without overturning their respective governments of 
 Imperialist capital, their states, which are the heart of this 
 system that is dragging us into a world war.
