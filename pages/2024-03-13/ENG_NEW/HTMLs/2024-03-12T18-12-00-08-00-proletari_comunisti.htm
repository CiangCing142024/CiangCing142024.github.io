  The imminent European journey of Marcos Jr, from 11 to 15 
 March, to sign maritime security agreements with Germany and the 
 Czech Republic, it is a brazen demonstration of warflower disguised as 
 diplomacy, and of political frivolity and extravagance.

 <p class="MsoNormal">
  While millions of Filipine working masses fight against 
 the intensification of the economic difficulties and calamities that require 
 urgent attention, Marcos Jr instead grants a sumptuous escapade in 
 Europe immediately after its failed attempt to use the Australian Parliament 
 to clean up the bloody curriculum of his regime, where the senator of 
 Verdi Janet Rice criticized him for the violations of human rights of his 
 regime.

 military, the United States, 
 further increasing the inter-imperialist tensions between China and the United States. 
 Gather the allies of the United States to be increasingly involved in the 
 dispute on the Western Philippine Sea serves the imperialist design of the 
 Use to cause Beijing as he implements the "strategy of the chain of 
 Islands "of the United States for maritime containment. This journey 
 He barely puts Marcos' unsuitable submission to his masters 
 US imperialists, supporting the United States war preparations 
 in Asia at the expense of public funds and the inclined threat to sovereignty 
 Philippine.

 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Marcos' trip to Europe is also a show 
 selfish politician, who squanders the money of taxpayers on the pretext of 
 "Promote bilateral cooperation". During the resolutions of the 
 Congress of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the budget of the 
 last year, the president's office required a 71% increase in 
 travel budget for 2024. In fact, these visits to Europe mark the 
 5th and 6th Marcos trip only in 2024. Apart from Australia, Marcos was 
 In Vietnam last January and participated in a royal wedding in Brunei 
 At the beginning of this year.

 <p class="MsoNormal">
  Giving priority to F1 races in Singapore (in fact, 
 Marcos has not failed to participate in an F1 race since he hired 
 the assignment in 2022) and his other races abroad, Marcos reveals his 
 propensity for the useless performances of foreign diplomacy, its profound 
 detachment from the realities faced by the Filipino working masses and his 
 blind adhesion to US imperialist pushes.
