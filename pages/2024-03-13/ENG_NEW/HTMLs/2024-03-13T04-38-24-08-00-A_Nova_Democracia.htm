  The governors Tarcisio de Freitas (Republicans), from São Paulo (SP), and Ronaldo Caiado (União Brasil), from Goiás (GO), will board next week on an invitation to the invitation of Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The tour will feature a script marked by the Zionist counter -propropaganda of the recent events in Palestine, including a passage through the place where Rave Supernova took place on October 7th. Both parties should also take the opportunity to discuss agreements related to agreements between Brazil and Israel, as diplomatic, economic and military relations between the two states are in force.
 </p>
 <p>
  The trip will take place between 18 and 22 March. In addition to the Protionist Freitas and Caiado, the Minas Gerais reactionary governor Romeu Zema (Novo) was invited, but denied the invitation for having other commitments in the period. During the week of travel, the governors will meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no official justification for the visit. According to Brazilian Zionists living in Israel, the visit is to offer a view on the effects of October 7. Already Tarcísio de Freitas listed that the two states have "important partnerships, purchase of equipment" and a "excellent relationship". "We are accepting an invitation and point," he concluded.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is quite possible that military agreements are discussed. The Press Monopoly
  <em>
   CNN
  </em>
  He reported that the script may include a visit to an intelligence and strategy center of the Zionist Armed Forces. In recent weeks, Governor Goiano has closed two new agreements with Israel during the inauguration of a pro-action park in Goiás.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is possible because, despite the various manifestations of the Brazilian popular masses through Brazil's diplomatic, economic and military breakup with Israel, Luiz Inacio's government insists on the maintenance of relations with the Zionist state.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Ideological visit
 </h4>
 <p>
  Cinically, Tarcisio de Freitas stated that the trip will be "without ideology and without politics." The statement is incongruous with the travel script itself and the general context of its surroundings.
 </p>
 <p>
  On the same day Caiado signed the agreements with Israel, the Goian Governor inaugurated a park in honor of the victims of October 7. The Pro-Nionist Monument did not mention the Palestinians, classified Hamas as “terrorist” and ignored the complaints of the Israeli press that many of the civilians were killed by the military of Israel, not by the Palestinian combatants.
 </p>
 <p>
  In January of this year, Tarcisio also stood out for his proximity to Zionist entities by attending an event organized by the Israeli Congregation Paulista (CIP). Supposedly performed to honor the victims of the Holocaust, the ceremony was marked by political discourses that sought, among other elements, to equate the "anti -Semitism" to "anti -joining".
 </p>
 <p>
  The visit to the Palestinian lands occupied by Israel, therefore, tends to reinforce all relationships of Zionism with Brazil, in general, and with the ultrarectionary agents of Zionism in Brazilian lands, in particular.
