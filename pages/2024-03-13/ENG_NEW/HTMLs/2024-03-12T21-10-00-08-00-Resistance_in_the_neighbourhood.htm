 In the last 9 weeks, the PAMA student club, along with the other student clubs in the country as well as a large part of society, is fighting for public and free education against the new Pierrakakis bill that brings private universities and tuition to public Article 16. In the context of the occupation, the Coordination Committee has decided to claim the offices of the student club, which for years now, instead of being open to all PAK students, were openly exclusively to members and executives of DAP-NDFK. ONNED and the New Democracy.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In the offices of the club, therefore, there was a large volume of illegal and irregular material that should not be in the hands of anyone, but at all accidental, it was in the hands of the DAP. More specifically found:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 1. Distribution Proofs: Sealed Election Folders with DAP-NDFK ballots
 <br/>
 <br/>
 2. Election Proceedings of 2022 and 2023 which at the end of student election voting must be destroyed
 <br/>
 <br/>
 3. Seminar attendance certificates signed without names
 <br/>
 <br/>
 4. Lists with the names of PAKE students and trade unionists. Even documents with student personal information have been found, which only the secretariat and the student are entitled to hold!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 5. Plenty of notes and exam topics.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Based on these elements we can easily conclude what DAP-NDFK is, especially at the University of Macedonia where DAP-NDFK has been self-sufficient for many years. That is, those who talk about excellence, open schools and imagine "hoodlums" are the ones who make their own paramilitaries of our club, who encloses students and students, who own student documents so they can use them against them against them against them. , distributing seminar certificates and notes as leaflets. They have completely fallen on the existence of student associations with patronage and customer relations with students, and their connection to the teaching establishment is clear and proven for many years.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 As a racing moves, we perceive the student club differently and the political processes within it. We are fighting for a university that will fit all the children of the people and not a few and chosen, for a student club possible with students in the struggle for public and free education. That is, exactly what he opposes nails and teeth (literally several times, such as in SEY in Ioannina, where members of the DAP with crowds threatened students) the government faction within universities. Students as we have been doing for 2 months, as we have done at the PAK's historic General Assembly on 24/1, to continue against reactionary policy on education and its expressor within the schools, DAP-NDFK, and continue the race. to the end to overthrow the law on private universities.
