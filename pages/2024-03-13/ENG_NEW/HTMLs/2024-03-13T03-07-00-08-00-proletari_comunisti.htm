  In 2023 he went 
 Visiting in Jordan and here is kidnapped by the secrets of secrets 
 Giordani who intended to deliver it to Israel. But after six months of 
 detention, the great mobilization that followed the news of the

 He returns to Italy, in L'Aquila, where on January 29 of this year, a 
 following a request for acquittal of the Zionist State of 
 Israel, the Italian authorities arrest him and are preparing for

 imaginative, apparently, of having made up a cell in Italy 
 who designed attacks. Anan's lawyer speaks of timing

 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  To a situation that is complicated must answer and replies 
 Already today the continuity of the campaign for its liberation. AND' 
 in fact provided in L'Aquila, in front of the court, where it will be discussed 
 the case, a new garrison and on March 20 in Rome, a further 
 event. A story that proves once again the 
 complicity and servility of the Italian state compared to projects 
 of persecution and annihilation of political opponents 
 Palestinians by the state of Israel but shows how today the 
 solidarity with the Palestinian people, with the Palestinian resistance

 popular mobilization, internationalist solidarity. Tomorrow a information on the 
 demonstration in front of today's L'Aquila court, with the
