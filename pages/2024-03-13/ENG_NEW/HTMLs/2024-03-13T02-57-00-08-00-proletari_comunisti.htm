 Last weekend was characterized by the great 
 mobilization of women for March 8, who combined in forms 
 wide with the mobilization for Palestine.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The manifestations 
 of the women of Rome and Milan, the many events, small and 
 large, which were there on a national scale have seen returning to 
 Massa the movement of women in the squares, in the processions. In the center of 
 These mobilizations were essentially two themes: the question 
 of violence against women, feminicides, and the entire system 
 capitalist patriarchal who, in different forms, converges on these 
 issues and makes even more difficult life to workers, at 
 women, to girls.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In these 
 demonstrations the strength of the great event is echoed 
 of Rome of over half a million people on November 25th.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The role of 
 women and girls in the general movement has returned to being 
 important. Now it is necessary that it continues giving life to one 
 systematic participation of women in all events 
 against the government, against the imperialist war, in solidarity 
 To Palestinian women.

 The important initiative of the proletarian feminist movement must be considered 
 Revolutionary who hit these days on workers, 
 on the workers, actively intervening and organizing delegations of 
 workers in the events. We particularly point out the 
 initiatives to the factories of Bergamo, Montello and Beretta, 
 The initiatives in Palermo, the initiatives in Taranto. Great 
 Importance was the presence of the representation of the MFPR at 
 Two main events in Milan, in which the MFR companions brought the item of the 
 workers and at the same time they have strengthened the choice of 
 Maximum solidarity with Palestinian women, their resistance.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the blog 
 Communist proletarians, on the blog of the proletarian feminist movement 
 Revolutionary, you can find, listen and read reports, 
 images, videos, interventions that took place in these events.
 </p>
 <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   Two: the event 
 has shown that solidarity is stronger than the war of 
 aggression, the invasion, the occupation, the genocide plan, which 
 It is tenacity and that its absolute trust affirms that the 
 Palestinian people will win. Great was the support for 
 Resistance in all forms of the Palestinian people.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   But March 9 is 
 was also the day of the Palestinian woman. Throughout the procession 
 Palestinian women and representatives of the Palestinian communities have 
 expressed all the strength that the Palestinian woman expresses in the struggle 
 against Zionism, the state of Israel, imperialism, e 
 in being in the front row and background of the great resistance that the 
 people are developing.
  </p>
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   In tune with 
 This imprint that had the demonstration of March 9, are 
 were the interventions that the proletarian feminist movement 
 Revolutionary has brought to this event with flyers, 
 With an intervention by partner Donatella, national representative 
 of our movement and bringing the maximum support to every aspect of the 
 Battle of Palestinian women. The solidarity banner that 
 it highlighted how Palestinian women are transforming into 
 pain in force, had the imprint of a great message and one 
 Great indication not only for Palestinian women, but for women 
 that all over the world struggle against the imperialist system, 
 against capitalist oppression, patriarchate and all forms of 
 oppression. It must be said that on the morning of March 9 a 
 delegation of the MFPR has challenged prohibitions and obstacles, bringing 
 Striscioni of reporting of the genocide under the headquarters of the consulate 
 Israeli in Milan.
