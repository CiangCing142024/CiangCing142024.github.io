published on\n  </em>\n  <a href=\"https://www.yenidemokrasi34.net/yerel-secimlerde-tavrimiz.html\">\n   <em>\n    New democracy\n   </em>\n  </a>\n  <em>\n   .\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   First of all, the fact that revolutionary democratic movements put elections at the center of discussions in these times is one of the most obvious weaknesses of recent times. The election-centered discussion of the fundamental problems of the revolution essentially points to the hegemony of elections serving the ruling classes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As we have emphasized before, and as an opinion we should pay special attention to during this period, all choices, whether general or local, will largely unite the masses with the reactionary order; The rulers use the masses as filling material in their mutual power struggle; To hide disorganization and judge the people of lack of will by reducing popular administration to only choosing administrators and thus facilitating ideological hegemony of the people; Let's repeat that it serves to stifle the tendency to act with anger and reaction against the rulers for the sake of reform.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   From the past to the present, the revolutionary movement has assessed the election processes' politicizing function as a means of organizing by using legal opportunities. These processes are processes that provide important opportunities for agitation propaganda, which is a means of organizing the people in the ranks of the revolution. Therefore, it is not possible for revolutionaries to stay indifferent to these processes. In these processes, it is almost a necessity to determine a specific policy, to determine the reflections of the general line and the principles, to talk to his own words to the politicized masses and to explain the purpose and the way. To neglect and underestimate this ultimately means denying the role of masses in revolutions. For the revolution, the masses must be informed about the revolution. The main task of the electoral processes is to achieve this. The important thing is to bring the consciousness of the revolution to the masses, expand the possibilities of fighting the system and mobilize them to political power.\n  </p>\n  <p p=\"\">\n   <p>\n    Therefore, no one in the public would even discuss the reality of the Communists' general assessment of the elections, let alone accept it. Almost everyone knows that elections in Turkey only serve to determine which clique of the ruling class will govern the 'national' parliament or the municipal council in particular. Although we know that these assemblies are unlikely to change order and realize the interests of the people, the public is prevented from having the income that these assemblies provide and using the funding and various opportunities that exist there. This is the main feature of parliamentary and local elections...\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    Elections on this basis are based on deciding who should be in the administrations whose boundaries are determined by reactionary laws to comply with this order. It turns into an approval of the fascist order every time. It cannot be the attitude of the revolutionary movement to decide who the masses should prefer in the ongoing struggle for the same reactionary goals between the dominant clicks. Wherever it turns into this, our basic attitude should and will be to protest against the election and remain indifferent to this decision.\n   </p>\n   <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n    Increased number of attacks\n   </h4>\n   <p p=\"\">\n    <p p=\"\">\n     <p>\n      Under the total attack that has continued since 2015, the bourgeois-feudal dictatorship now considers its fascist laws and even its constitution as a limiting factor. Intensive reactionism, which is particularly hostile to the Kurds everywhere and in every position, acts as an aggressive force in the region, including Iraq and Syria, and tries to strangle even the slightest requirement for rights in the country, has become a stable line. For us, this is an obligation to \"show the origin\". It is not a deviation from the Republic that some people think, but it is: the state almost without mask.\n     </p>\n     <p p=\"\">\n      <p>\n       Local elections take place in such a political climate. The administrator's cane is used with experience and open threat. Elections that do not take place in a democratic environment are organized within the established rules with the approach that the resulting will will be unsurposed.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n       The fascist dictatorship, with all its power, organizes these choices with a strong chauvinist campaign. The masses are surrounded, poisoned and shaped by political arguments such as hostility towards Kurds, \"terrorism,\" nationality and localism \"and hostility to false imperialism. In this image, all the chauvinist reflections caused by the disorganization of the surrounded people also strengthen the social chauvinist approaches. Social chauvinist trends gain influence among the masses against the AKP-MHP click, and the opposition, but chauvinist parties, are seen as the least evil in this election.\n      </p>\n      <p p=\"\">\n       <p>\n        Reformism emerges in front of us with a political formation that is far from understanding the political nature of the process and seizing the real problems of the people.\n       </p>\n       <p>\n        The main problem for the masses, who are literally trapped under hunger, poverty and fascist oppression, is how they can handle daily life, rather than who should rule. The election and the debate over which party will prevail is a debate that the rulers are trying to create. The masses' expectation is never salvation. \"No one\" alternative is stronger, but the prerequisite for this alternative to become a material power is weak. After each election, stronger economic and political attacks are carried out by the fascist dictatorship. The needs of the masses are to reach the root of the contradictions, to expand their rights through independent action by elaborating on these contradictions and to enter a battle that will challenge the rulers. Choices, on the other hand, lead to the pacification of stricter contradictions, hinder the masses' quest for independent action and serves to elaborate the disorganization.\n       </p>\n       <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left\">\n        The will of the people against the election game\n       </h4>\n       <p p=\"\">\n        <p>\n         We once again urge all revolutionary forces to honor Partizan's mission and history in connection with the soil of the name 'Partizan' because of the opportunism and insidious existence of the well -known group.

On the occasion of March 8, it will again be expressed on television, in parliaments, in seats, in stands and on international platforms, that women's freedoms from working life to social life and fundamental rights have been expanded and must be expanded. On March 8, they will celebrate \"International Women's Day\" with greater \"enthusiasm\" than we do, and they will keep talking about women's rights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         On the one hand, they will tell us the lie of how great progress they have made with regard to women's rights, and on the other, they will hide the historical significance, the content and the essence of March 8. They will hide the class structure of the women's struggle for rights and freedom and pretend that it was those who gave women their rights.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         But we know what the truth is. On March 8, 1857, the bloody story of a strike is organized by 40,000 working women in New York to demand \"an abbreviation of the 16-hour working day for 10 hours and equal pay for equal work.\" During the strike, thousands of workers were locked inside at the factory of the police with the support of the bosses, and 129 striking workers died in the ensuing flames. At the International Socialist Women's Conference in 1910, on March 8, on the proposal of Clara Zetkin, the working women's international match day, dedicated to the memory of the murdered strikers.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         The reality of the imperialist citizenship and all reactionary forces talking about women's rights by hiding March 8's class character that is ours is a completely different one. In dozens of semi -feudal, semi -colonial countries like Turkey, even our most basic rights are an oasis in the desert. The exercise of many fundamental rights such as the right to life, inviolability, freedom and security, establishment and travel freedom, freedom of thought and expression, financial freedom, the right to work and divorce and the right to engage in politics are rights that are both difficult, And when we see them, we women are murdered, subjected to violence, isolated and subjected to social pressure. In Turkey alone, 52 women were murdered for various reasons in January 2024. In countries such as India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the countries of the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Turkey are brutal violence and murder of women on the agenda.\n        </p>\n        <p p=\"\">\n         <p>\n          The imperialists who are the enemies of the people and the working women can never hide their true face in the wars they are leading or provoking. In Palestine, the Zionist Israeli war machine performs a massacre that does not distinguish between children, women and the elderly. Women are the weak link in this cruelty. On the one hand, they are massacred with a merciless blockade, on the other, they are treated as \"oppressed\" objects in attempts at a ceasefire. To downplay the Palestinian resistance, the imperialists once again develop psychological warfare over women's bodies. In the figure with the \"barbaric Palestinians\", the women's problem is hypocritically used as a lever.\n         </p>\n         <p p=\"\">\n          <p>\n           The imperialist system of its overdue capital, its degenerate culture, its hypocritical democracy, its structure, whose other characteristic is war, is the production center of all forms of reaction that reverberates women's rights and freedom and draws us into a vertebrae of male -dominated violence . Their alliances with the feudal forces of their semi -colonies are misogyne. The chauvinism, build -up and war policy that they promote in their own countries is also culturally based on male supremacy and nourishes misogyni. The honey they lubricate our mouths means that we are happy with what is available and accepts our fate. Which in turn would mean that we accept their utilizing, blood -sucking, women's hostile system, including male supremacy.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            We will not accept it. We will not submit to. We will not give way back from our fight.\n           </strong>\n           We will not settle for limited, symbolic rights. There will be no release of working women as long as the source of exploitation, violence, poverty, aggression and unfair wars does not dry out. We will fight our struggle with the awareness of complete liberation, not less. We will not lead our struggle with a liberal spirit, but with a revolutionary spirit.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           Therefore, March 8 is neither a simple \"Women's Day\" nor an instrument of capitalist consumer culture.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           8th March;\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           -\u2026 is a call for battle against unfair imperialist wars.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           -\u2026 is a call for rebellion against the diverse exploitation and oppression of female workers.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           -\u2026 is a call to expand women's revolutionary organization and struggle in this process, where the exploitation is increased and 'slave laws' are introduced.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           -\u2026 is a call to fight all kinds of patriarchal culture, religious reaction and all forms of discrimination.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           \u2013 ... is a call to organize against state violence against communist, revolutionary and progressive women in dungeons, prisons and on the streets.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           As purple-red collectives, we will meet on March 8, working women's international match day, on streets and squares with all our enthusiasm, challenge\n           <strong>\n            \u00bb\n           </strong>\n           <strong>\n            frustration and despair\n           </strong>\n           <strong>\n            \u00ab\n           </strong>\n           , smash women's hatred, oppose imperialist plundering and exploitation and never let us chase of fascism and feudalism.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            LIGHT\n           </strong>\n           <strong>\n            8.\n           </strong>\n           <strong>\n            March, World Works Women Day!\n           </strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            Stop sexual, national and classic exploitation!\n           </strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            No to imperialist warfare, exploitation and parasitism!\n           </strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            Purple-red collective\n           </strong>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            MARTS 2024\n           </strong>\n          </p>\n          <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n           <strong>\n            Activities and inventory for March 8\n           </strong>\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n           <strong>\n            2. marts\n           </strong>\n          </p>\n          <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n           <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Featured_Ekran-Resmi-1024x572.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Featured_Ekran-Resmi-1024x572.webp\"/>\n          </figure>\n          <p>\n           <em>\n            Mobilization in March to it\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            Working women\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            not\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            s I\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            nternation\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            Kamp\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            day, Istanbul,\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            3.\n           </em>\n           <em>\n            March.

Industrial workers worked under unusually difficult conditions. Women led into the working class of the period and went on strike to demand a reduction of the 16-hour work day to 10 hours, correction of inhuman working conditions, an increase in wages and equal rights for female workers.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           Following this event, Clara Zetkin and Rosa Luxemburg, leaders of the Social Democratic Party in Germany, suggested at the Women of the Women in the 2nd International (International Socialist Women The proposal was accepted.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           Since then, women have fought for the demands made by the murdered weavers.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           The women continued to be inspired by this resistance story and walked the streets every 8 March despite all the pressure, the difficult conditions and the prohibitions.

The paths of migration become the paths of death for women.

Women who are fighting for their rights are also exposed to all forms of violence by the patriarchal state.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           In this geography, as in Palestine and Rojava, poor people, mostly, become women and LGBTI+'are massacred in the wars that the imperialist capitalist system leads in search of markets.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n           On the other hand, the patriarchal state and its representatives AKP-MHP's obvious massacre on workers and nature in Erzincan \u0307li\u00e7 will create serious problems in the region in the coming years.

All five were accused of having links to the banned Communist Party of India (Maoists) and charged under various sections of the UAPA. But the state had especially targeted Rona Wilson...\n           </p>\n           <p>\n            National Investigation Board (\n            <em>\n             red. \u2013\n            </em>\n            National Investigation Agency (NIA)) has accused Rona of trying to create turmoil in India as they have seized some documents from him talking about how oppressed groups such as Dalites and Muslims should come together to form an antifascist unit front to strengthen the mass mobilization of people. For this reason, police appointed Rona to conspire to murder Prime Minister Narendra Modi, based on the police's claims of finding a letter among Rona's possessions\u2026\n           </p>\n           <p>\n            Several years after his unfair arrest, Arsenal Advice analysed the electronic copies of co-defendants Rona's and Surendra's computers at the request of the defence. Arsenal Consulting (a Massachusetts-based digital forensics company) had stated that an attacker used malware to infiltrate Wilson's laptop and deposited at least ten incriminating letters on it. These included an alleged letter to a Maoist militant discussing the need for weapons and ammunition and even calling on the banned group to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n           </p>\n           <p>\n            A year later, the Washington Post released a report that revealed that Rona was the target of two different groups of hackers before he was arrested. \u2026 ModifieDelephant, the primary hacker, sent emails with documents or attachments-filled with commercially available malware such as Netwire and Darkcomet-tailored to the victim's interests and were often copied to several recipients they knew, Sentinelone said. Wilson received at least 32 emails from ModifieDelephan, and Gadling was a recipient of 40 such emails from the group.\n           </p>\n           <p>\n            \u2026 Three independent experts in the US and Europe reviewed the Sentinelone report at The Post's request and joined its conclusions. It is worrying that researchers say the earliest attack on Wilson can be traced back to a decade ago, even though the email attacks intensified in 2014 and continued until at least 2016.\n           </p>\n           <p>\n            \u2026 The state has painted him like that, just as they have painted those who fight against injustice, for hope, as terrorists, as anti-national. The question is still - if nation? In a country that is a prison for nationalities itself, do we have to accept the state's agenda to establish a Hindu Rashtra? Should we accept a 'nation' built on the blood of Muslims, adivasis, oppressed throws, women and other oppressed groups? Should we accept a nation that throws its most patriotic, land -loving people in prison for having a voice, albeit one who speaks to the people, about their demands, instead of the state's chauvinist and reactionary agenda?
