We particularly point out the \n initiatives to the factories of Bergamo, Montello and Beretta, \n The initiatives in Palermo, the initiatives in Taranto. Great \n Importance was the presence of the representation of the MFPR at \n Two main events in Milan, in which the MFR companions brought the item of the \n workers and at the same time they have strengthened the choice of \n Maximum solidarity with Palestinian women, their resistance.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  On the blog \n Communist proletarians, on the blog of the proletarian feminist movement \n Revolutionary, you can find, listen and read reports, \n images, videos, interventions that took place in these events.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\" style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n   Two: the event \n has shown that solidarity is stronger than the war of \n aggression, the invasion, the occupation, the genocide plan, which \n It is tenacity and that its absolute trust affirms that the \n Palestinian people will win. Great was the support for \n Resistance in all forms of the Palestinian people.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n   But March 9 is \n was also the day of the Palestinian woman. Throughout the procession \n Palestinian women and representatives of the Palestinian communities have \n expressed all the strength that the Palestinian woman expresses in the struggle \n against Zionism, the state of Israel, imperialism, e \n in being in the front row and background of the great resistance that the \n people are developing.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n   In tune with \n This imprint that had the demonstration of March 9, are \n were the interventions that the proletarian feminist movement \n Revolutionary has brought to this event with flyers, \n With an intervention by partner Donatella, national representative \n of our movement and bringing the maximum support to every aspect of the \n Battle of Palestinian women. The solidarity banner that \n it highlighted how Palestinian women are transforming into \n pain in force, had the imprint of a great message and one \n Great indication not only for Palestinian women, but for women \n that all over the world struggle against the imperialist system, \n against capitalist oppression, patriarchate and all forms of \n oppression. It must be said that on the morning of March 9 a \n delegation of the MFPR has challenged prohibitions and obstacles, bringing \n Striscioni of reporting of the genocide under the headquarters of the consulate \n Israeli in Milan.\n  </p>\n  <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n  </div>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "As a counter -information Ross Operaia dated 12/03 last weekend was characterized by the great mobilization of women for the 8 ...", "author": ["prolcomra"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-12-marzo-le-grandi-manifestazioni.html", "source_name": "proletari comunisti"}
