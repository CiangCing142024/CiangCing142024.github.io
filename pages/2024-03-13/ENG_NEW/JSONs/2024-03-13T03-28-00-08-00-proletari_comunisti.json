In itself it is one \n negligible figure, it is calculated that with 1.5 billion the EU could \n finance the purchase of just 58 Leopard 2. But, he explains \n Borrell, \u00abThe bottom is an incentive to invest, not for \n replace states \".\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  A project, \n According to the commissioner for the internal market and the services, Breton, \n which initially needs 100 billion (in Eurobond) to arrive \n to a turning point. But of that money, in the new EU plan, there is no \n trace.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  The weapons \n they could be purchased by a consortium of European countries \n sponsored by the Commission with the same model that was adopted \n For anti-covid vaccines and, especially for ammunition that are the \n more urgent chapter of the supplies in Kiev, they could \n Use the funds of the Russian oligarchs frozen by the sanctions \n after the start of the aggression to Ukraine. For the rest, at \n more expenses for purchases of war material should be done \n in front of the same way that the Next Generation EU was created \n And to the PNRRs: the creation of European debt.

Edis (European strategy for \n The industrial defense sector) aims to encourage Europeans a \n work cooperatively and to invest jointly in the \n skills built in Europe. Invites Member States to buy \n At least 40% of military equipment collaboratively - \n that is, without weighing their feet with each other - and 50% \n within the EU by 2030, reaching 60% by \n 2035. To do this, the Commission intends to facilitate and support \n Joint programs using multiple funding and tools \n regulations, which are based on the strengthening of the European industry \n of the defense through the law on common contracts (Edirpa) and the \n law in support of the production of ammunition (ASAP).\n </p>\n <p p=\"\" style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n   Must \n Mention that in the meantime, participation in European military missions \n has already been underway for some time and this \"common defense\" is invoked \n by the imperialists while they hide each of them the dagger behind \n The back ready to launch it to competing imperialism. \n They converge tactically but the political and economic interests there \n they bring on a collision course, today they come together on Ukraine, medium \n East, a peaceful nature for a power policy of imperialism \n European, in reality a European imperialism that is made up of various \n Imperialist countries whose strength relationships remain in balance \n more and more precarious.\n  </p>\n  <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n   To push for \n coordinate the skills of member countries in defense development \n In particular, the governments of Estonia, France and Poland, \n signatories of an appeal that relaunches the military defensive capacity \n continental.
