 </figure>\n  <p>\n   Indeed, following the dismissal by Grand Lyon Habitat of this former guardian of the building in early January, the discontent won the inhabitants knowing him, and solidarity was built very largely, until the holding of a rally on Wednesday March 6.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Let's go back to the story around this dismissal: last November, the goalkeeper was awakened one morning at 7 a.m. by several police officers who are drumming at his door. In question, a vast police descent in the United States district. Police forces then ask him for the keys to the cellars. The goalkeeper then came across 4 young people, handcuffed and kneeling, and, abused, under pressure and completely destabilized he replied that he did not have them.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Upon the arrival of the agency director more than an hour later, the latter also attacks the goalkeeper, who gave him the keys explaining to him that he had found them after the request of the police officers, that he does not want to hinder the police but that in the midst of the operation he preferred to wait for his superior.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The continuation is funny or terrifying, as desired: the 4 young people are released for lack of evidence, the garages forced by the locksmith prove to be empty, and the exploration of the cellars offers absolutely no element for the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Neither the police nor justice then criticizes the former Garden for having hampered the investigation, but Grand Lyon Habitat Si, and the agency director begins disciplinary procedure with regard to his employee for fault serious, hinders the work of the police, and an attitude which would have been disrespectful and close to the insubordination in front of his superior.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   While his work is recognized and praised by his colleagues and the inhabitants, the proof is with the wave of solidarity which swept, Rachid is finally dismissed in January, after several months of procedure, not receiving after more than 30 years of work at GLH that a little more than 2000 \u20ac and having to make its official accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Indeed, its official housing is handed over to the private housing market, which implies that the next building goalkeeper, who will potentially be an employee in subcontracting, will have no function housing. The lessor would thus kill two strokes with one stone, recovering more accommodation to add to his housing stock, and getting rid of the management of employees who would be delegated to an intermediary.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Faced with this new demonstration of the unworthy methods and thugs of Grand Lyon Habitat, the CPES and Rachid decide to organize a rally in front of his home, a hundred meters from the United States agency of the lessor.\n  </p>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">\n    Source: new time\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p>\n   About 60 people therefore found themselves during the gathering to listen to the various speeches, sign the support petition or discuss the continuation to give this mobilization.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It was first Rachid who thanked the people who came to support him at length, supporting the fact that collective mobilization is the strength of \"small against large\".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A spokesperson for the CPES then supported this declaration, calling for continuing the fight, and insisting that the committee would continue to fight alongside Rachid and all the inhabitants abused by the lessor Voyou Glh.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \"We take this opportunity to inform you that a legal proceedings of formal notice is currently underway to require control of these charges coming to couple all our popular mobilizations, and we also affirm that we will support Rachid as much as it is necessary Until he obtains compensation,\n   <strong>\n    Because whether Rachid or the charges, we are faced with the same problem: residents of despised working-class neighborhoods, as are workers in factories or women relegated to secondary and underpaid jobs. \u201d\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">\n    Source: new time\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <p>\n   We were also able to question Coralia, member of the CPES, on the consequences of this mobilization:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   New era (ne): Hello, thank you for answering our questions. First of all, how did you know this case?\n   <br/>\n   Coralia: So we got to know this case because Rachid contacted the CPES. Indeed, he had already seen our work in the neighborhood, it was one of his neighbors who provided him with our contact.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ne: Now that this gathering is made, what do you prepare to continue the fight against this injustice?\n   <br/>\n   Coralia: What came out of this gathering is that everyone wants to go further, gathering in front of the antenna of the United States of Grand Lyon Habitat to affirm their dissatisfaction with this injustice. We will continue to broadcast this case in the neighborhood so that the tenants are aware that GLH despises them but also despises its employees.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ne: You are talking about the contempt of Greater Lyon Habitat against his tenants, this takes us on the question of your fight against abusive charges, can you tell us where the situation is?\n   <br/>\n   Coralia: We have started first legal proceedings for formal notice through a lawyer in order to obtain a check of the charges. We are not fooled, we are aware that it is not only by the judicial route that we will achieve our ends, but it is a tool to show once again than together we are strong, and in order to Unmask the mafia schemes of Grand Lyon Habitat.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ne: Finally, last question: what do you want to say to all those who are in the same situation, who are crushed by thugs or dishonest bosses and who undergo injustices?\n   <br/>\n   Coralia: I take a sentence from Rachid, we will \"show the big ones that the little ones when they are all together, they are strong\". This is the goal of the CPES, to recreate solidarity in the neighborhood to be able to fight, to be aware that collectively we are a force and to win victories and no longer let it go.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Don't you: would you like to add something?\n   <br/>\n   Coralia: As everyone in the neighborhood has understood, the situation of Rachid is neither trivial nor isolated, it reminds us of the difficulties that everyone faces, and today we must fight together to do justice To the people who will no longer let themselves be done, for all those who have been crushed and could not make the blows.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ne: Thank you, and see you very soon!\n   <br/>\n   Coralia: Thanks to you, good evening.\n  </p>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n    <p class=\"IMAGE_ARCHIVED\">\n     &lt;The image of this location is in the list above, but in order to protect the site's traffic costs, it cannot be displayed here, sorry.&gt;\n    </p>\n   </figure>\n   <figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">\n    Source: new time\n   </figcaption>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n   <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n    <iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"392\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VGSTEzmOBKE?feature=oembed\" title=\"Lyon\u00a0: un rassemblement organis\u00e9 par le CPES en soutien \u00e0 un ex-employ\u00e9 de Grand Lyon Habitat\" width=\"696\">\n    </iframe>\n   </div>\n  </figure>\n  <div class=\"wp-block-file\" data-wp-interactive=\"\">\n   <object aria-label=\"Contenu embarqu\u00e9 prise-de-parole-1.\" class=\"wp-block-file__embed\" data=\"https://www.nouvelleepoque.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prise-de-parole-1.pdf\" data-wp-bind--hidden=\"!selectors.core.file.hasPdfPreview\" hidden=\"\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px\" type=\"application/pdf\">\n   </object>\n   <a href=\"https://www.nouvelleepoque.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prise-de-parole-1.pdf\" id=\"wp-block-file--media-52032871-92d1-42d8-ade8-55db9a97babd\">\n    PAP-DE-DE-1\n   </a>\n   <a aria-describedby=\"wp-block-file--media-52032871-92d1-42d8-ade8-55db9a97babd\" class=\"wp-block-file__button wp-element-button\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.nouvelleepoque.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prise-de-parole-1.pdf\">\n    Download\n   </a>\n  </div>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.nouvelleepoque.fr/video-lyon-un-rassemblement-organise-par-le-cpes-en-soutien-a-un-ex-employe-de-grand-lyon-habitat/", "type": "article", "title": "[Video] Lyon: A rally organized by the CPES in support of an ex -employee of Grand Lyon Habitat - New era", "description": "The emotion was present this Wednesday, March 6 for Rachid on Wednesday, for Rachid and the residents of the United States who came to support him.
