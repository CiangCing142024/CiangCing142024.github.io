However, what can seem natural due to the conditions of the country, is also linked to the negligence applied by the old State towards the healthcare of the Brazilian people, especially in poor neighborhoods, and coincides with the research carried out on dengue transmitting mosquitoes and with these epidemics.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The newspaper AND explains the beginnings of the genetic editing investigations of the Dengue transmitter mosquito in Brazil:\n  <em>\n   \u201cResearch on the use of genetic\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   editing\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   to combat the\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   transmitter\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Aedes\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Aegypti\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   was initiated in 2011 in Brazil by the\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   Yancies Single the\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   xitec pharmaceutical.

From 2022 a Japanese pharmaceutical monopoly, Takeda, is involved in mosquito release operations in Brazil. Today it produces the\n  <em>\n   Qdenga\n  </em>\n  vaccines, bought by the Brazilian government. In 2023, the UN World Mosquito Program was added to these operations, releasing billions of mosquitoes as a measure to control the reproduction of the dengue transmitting species,\n  <em>\n   Temples of the Egyptians.\n  </em>\n  AND points out the consequence of this new mass release:\n  <em>\n   \u201cIn 2023, the World Mosquito Program of the United Nations released its own genetically modified mosquitoes and in 2024 we will have a new record\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   of the epidemic\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   .\u201d\n  </em>\n  Simultaneously these large monopolies received contracts to produce and administer millions of vaccines.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Regarding the links of these monopolies and their investigations, with their use as a repressive mechanism by imperialism and the ruling classes, AND points out the relationship between the Bill Gates Foundation as one of the main investigating agents of these mosquitoes, and an agency from the Pentagon, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA):\n  <em>\n   \u201cIn 2017,\n   <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=en-US&amp;client=webapp&amp;u=https://www.rt.com/usa/412019-pentagon-darpa-gene-drive/\">\n    Bill Gates paid $ 1.6 million to a public relations\n   </a>\n   agency to block the moratorium proposed by the UN on the issue of genetic\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   editing\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   until\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   the\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   safety could be established.
