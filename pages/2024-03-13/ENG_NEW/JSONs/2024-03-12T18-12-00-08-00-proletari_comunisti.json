This journey \n He barely puts Marcos' unsuitable submission to his masters \n US imperialists, supporting the United States war preparations \n in Asia at the expense of public funds and the inclined threat to sovereignty \n Philippine.\n <o:p>\n </o:p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  Marcos' trip to Europe is also a show \n selfish politician, who squanders the money of taxpayers on the pretext of \n \"Promote bilateral cooperation\". During the resolutions of the \n Congress of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the budget of the \n last year, the president's office required a 71% increase in \n travel budget for 2024. In fact, these visits to Europe mark the \n 5th and 6th Marcos trip only in 2024. Apart from Australia, Marcos was \n In Vietnam last January and participated in a royal wedding in Brunei \n At the beginning of this year.\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  Giving priority to F1 races in Singapore (in fact, \n Marcos has not failed to participate in an F1 race since he hired \n the assignment in 2022) and his other races abroad, Marcos reveals his \n propensity for the useless performances of foreign diplomacy, its profound \n detachment from the realities faced by the Filipino working masses and his \n blind adhesion to US imperialist pushes.\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <b>\n   International Information Office NDFP | Forehead \n National Democrat of the Philippines\n  </b>\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n  <a href=\"https://philippinerevolution.nu/statements/marcos-euro-trip-is-a-brazen-display-of-warmongering-disguised-as-diplomacy/\">\n   https://philippinerevolution.nu/statements/marcos-euro-trip-is-a-brazen-display-of-warmongering-disguised-as-diplomacy/\n  </a>\n  <o:p>\n  </o:p>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "One of the many protests after the settlement of the Marcos Jr government The \"Euro-Vioggio\" of Marcos is a brazen demonstration of warfounding ...", "author": ["prolcompal"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-12-marzo-filippine-il-viaggio-in.html", "source_name": "proletari comunisti"}
