The Petrobras Engineers Association (AEPET) has denounced that the payment of required dividends can \u201ccompromise the future result\u201d and that the current company's shareholder remuneration policy is \u201cunsustainable\u201d.\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  What happened?\n </h4>\n <p>\n  Last week, the Petrobras board announced that it would not pay the extraordinary dividends to shareholders, but would normally make the payment of minimum dividends. The payment was made in the amount of R $ 14.2 billion.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Even so, the tycoons who live from the dividends have risen against the board in a leech riot. Shareholders threatened to sell their shares as a way to press the company's summit, and the state -owned company lost R $ 55.3 billion in the fictitious \u201cmarket value\u201d (based on the total sum of the company's common shares).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The government, being the company's largest shareholder, was also attacked by the Magnatas and its representatives in the \u201cintervention in the company\u201d press monopoly, especially after denying a half-term proposal from Petrobras's board of directors to pay half of the extraordinary dividends .\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  \u2018Future Harmful\u2019\n </h4>\n <p>\n  In this scenario, Petrobras engineers organized at AEPET denounced the current compensation policy of shareholders and the possible consequences of the payment of dividends to leeches.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In article entitled \u201c\n  <a href=\"https://aepet.org.br/artigo/direcao-da-petrobras-mantem-investimentos-baixos-e-dividendos-insustentavelmente-altos-em-2023/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Petrobras direction maintains low investments and unsustainably high dividends by 2023\n  </a>\n  \u201d, AEPET President Felipe Coutinho explained that the dividends paid are currently far above the company's investments. This is only possible because of the investments of the past, not the current ones.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIn 2021 and 2022 the average ratio between paid dividends and net investment was 804%, in the consolidated result of 2023 was 232.63%, while between 2005 and 2020 it was 12.7%, in average terms. That is, the relationship between dividend payment and net investment in 2023 was 18 times higher compared to the average from 2005 to 2020, \u201dexplains Coutinho. He concludes: \u201cIt is evident that raising the distribution of dividends over investments will compromise the future result.\u201d\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  \u2018Unsustainable dividends\u2019\n </h4>\n <p>\n  For Coutinho, there is a problem in the shareholders' own compensation policy. Petrobras is the integrated oil company that most pays dividends to shareholders worldwide, and this is kept in times of low revenue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cThe relationship between paid dividends and liquid investments demonstrates, in a fullest way, how the policies of Petrobras' high direction are discrepant in relation to the management of large world oil companies. Petrobras' relationship was 4.2 times higher than the average oil officer, \u201dhe says.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This remuneration policy designed to grant vampires of the nation, survivors of income resulting from the exploitation of national wealth for foreign interests, leads to an unsustainable framework in the company.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The measure is so severe that it can even compromise reserves replacement, maintenance of production and add value to Petrobras oil value. This is because it is only possible to maintain such a high payment of dividends with the very reduction in investments in activities such as oil production.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cIn analyzing the history of Petrobras and the results of large international oil companies, it is evident that dividends that have been paid by the state's high direction since 2021 are performed to the detriment of liquid investments and, therefore, among other factors, are unsustainable . Under the direction of the Lula administration and the management of Prates, nothing has changed so far, \u201dconcludes Coutinho.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/acionistas-da-petrobras-ameacam-empresa-com-exigencia-de-dividendos-extraordinarios-bilionarios-acima-dos-investimentos/", "type": "article", "title": "Petrobras shareholders threaten a company with the requirement of extraordinary billionaire dividends above investments - the new democracy", "description": "The Petrobras Engineers Association (AEPET) has denounced that the payment of required dividends can \u201ccompromise the future result\u201d and that the current company's shareholder remuneration policy is \u201cunsustainable\u201d.", "modified time": "2024-03-12T16:54:58-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-12T16:54:58-03:00", "author": ["Enrico Di Gregorio"], "categories": ["Situa\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica"], "tags": ["imperialismo", "petrobras"], "sections": ["Situa\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica"], "link-section": "situacao-politica", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
