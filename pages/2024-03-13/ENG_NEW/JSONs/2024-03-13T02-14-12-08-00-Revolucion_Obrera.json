The panorama presented to the student body and the university community in general is quite bleak, the candidates let us see who are the ones who really dispute the rectory of the Udea: on the one hand, the Antioquia bourgeoisie of the Antioquia business group\n   <strong>\n    (GEA)\n   </strong>\n   and his governor on duty, Uribista Andr\u00e9s Juli\u00e1n Rend\u00f3n; And on the other hand, the petrist bureaucracy with candidates close to the historical pact and the corrupt Daniel Quintero.\n  </p>\n  <pstrong>\n   \u201c\n   <em>\n    represents what we want for the government\n   </em>\n   \u201d\n   .\n   <p>\n    Among other candidates kneeling to the Business of Antioquia is Ram\u00f3n Javier Mesa, who was Vice Chancellor of Arboleda, that is, directly responsible for the administrative disaster and the scandalous budget deficit of 345 billion pesos that the Udea has, who also holds known relations with the GEA and with institutional right -wing political sectors. Also, and the most reactionary, is Manuel Santiago Mej\u00eda, a member of the GEA, owner of the Colombian of Commerce (corvette) that agglomera companies such as AKT motorcycles, Alkosto and Ktronix stores, and former member of the board of directors of the Public Companies of Medell\u00edn, Route N and Metro; Who was the Finance Manager \"\n    <em>\n     La Carolina\n    </em>\n    \u201dWhere the paramilitary group was founded\n    <em>\n     The twelve apostles\n    </em>\n    <p>\n     The influence of the historical pact, the main coalition of government of the country, also has chips and is not far behind, in a kind of measurement of forces with business and political sectors of Antioquia that represent the legacy of Uribism, have as spears in different currents to Luquegi Gil, who was general secretary of the Udea and Vice Dean and Dean of the Faculty of Law and Political Science during previous administrations such as Uribe Correa, Alviar and Arboleda; And also Javier Dar\u00edo Ledesma, specifically record of the disastrous former mayor of Medell\u00edn Daniel Quintero (who directly ordered the violent and brutal remembered intervention of the Esmad at the University of Antioquia on February 22, 2020), in addition to former manager and manager in EPM and EPM and Route N.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Other candidates such as Jaime Andr\u00e9s Cano or Lina Mar\u00eda Mu\u00f1oz do not represent more than a recycling and verbiage of several past administrations, having occupied charges on several levels previously in the Udea and other IES.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     So, as a student I call to be constantly aware of the administrative and financial reality of the University, as well as the political ties of those who direct it, also not to participate in the false university democracy that is nothing more than a competition in the That those candidates of the Antioquia bourgeoisie and the petrist bureaucracy measure forces.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     A UDEA student\n    </p>\n   </p>\n  </pstrong>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://revolucionobrera.com/actualidad/rectoria-en-la-udea/", "type": "article", "title": "Udea Rectory: between the Antioquia bourgeoisie and the petrist bureaucracy | Workers Revolution", "description": "On April 6, the rectoral period of the University of Antioquia ends, and with it one of the most disastrous and mercantilizing administrations of education", "author": ["Revoluci\u00f3n Obrera"], "tags": ["estudiantes", "Universidad de Antioquia"], "section": "Actualidad pol\u00edtica", "source_name": "Revolucion Obrera"}
