All over the country are utilized all administrative and judicial mechanisms to find militant teachers to find hostages in disciplinary and courtrooms. Various reactionary provisions of the Civil Service Code are utilized as well as the anti -union legal framework passed in recent years (Chatzidakis, Georgiadis Laws, etc.)\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Specifically there are:\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  \u00b7 4 persecutions (disciplinary and criminal) for participating in the mobilization of ELME Piraeus (with ADEDY workstation) against PISA exams.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  \u00b7 2 criminal and disciplinary persecution of teachers for \"inappropriate out -of -service behavior\", due to participation in mobilizing the anniversary of the murder of 15 -year -old Grigoropoulos, based on (junta inspiration) prohibitions in the pandemic.\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  \u00b7 3 Criminal Persecution of Teachers for the Mobilization of ELME Piraeus against the Piraeus Piraeus Fiesta-Fiasko in favor of private schools and for mobilization of the Association at the Piraeus GRN offices.
