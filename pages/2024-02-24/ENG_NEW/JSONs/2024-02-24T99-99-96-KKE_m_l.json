They now rank him in third place, under PASOK and further remove the case of recovery even in the rates of the summer elections of 2023. despite the precipitation that led to Tsipras' resignation, an official opposition was elected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SYRIZA-PS is unable to capitalize on political influence the anger and indignation of the wide layouts of the ND-Mitsotakis government's anti-populist policy. It is far from the people and has now been revealed in the most clear way that it is a party in the service of the system of exploitation, oppression and imperialist dependency. Kasselakis 'attempts to find himself close to agricultural mobilizations either by visits to farmers' blockages or with tractors, more like a \"folk profile\" caricature appeared rather than an attempt to associate with the problems and agonies of poor peasantry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  His proposals for \"renegotiation of the CAP\" within the EU are nothing more than one of the sides of the debate within the EU itself, both in imperialist and dependent countries, which has opened under the weight of the farmers' racing outburst. all over Europe. As for his other proposals, for cheap electricity and oil to farmers, he does not forget that they are hitting the strict \"fiscal discipline\" imposed by the EU's \"stability pact\" and the goals of surpluses already in place for 2024.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SYRIZA-PS's orientation to be the second pillar of the bourgeois political system again finds dead ends and the more right it makes, the more it loses in political influence. Those who had invested in the election of Kasselakis in the SYRIZA-PS leadership, believing that the data could change, today it is obvious that they are looking for other ways and more and more the trend of \"progressive convergence\", both with PASOK and with \"New Left\" and other scattered \"progressive\" forces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And this seems to be the basic pursuit of local capitalism, which while supporting the ND government and Mitsotakis, who are consistently serving it, is interested in stopping the political volatility as quickly as possible. Developments in SYRIZA-PS. And that interest is at the same time a serious issue for the imperialist US-EU, who want and demand that they have direct \"communication\" with the political formations of the bourgeois political system and to define behaviors, trends and alignments. In this context, the last decision-condemnation of the ND government by the European Parliament is included in the \"rule of law\" in Greece, as a serious reminder on the part of the EU imperialists that the bosses remain two.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The temporary compromise in the SYRIZA-PS leadership literally on the eve of 4\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  The conference is also an expression of the impasses that each side faces in drawing further confrontation and conflict, which would also mean its definitive disintegration from the level it is today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And while everything was shown that they were moving into a self -preservation compromise, as all sides are well aware that a political organization under dismantling could not play any role in any reform of the urban political scene, the sudden move of Tsipras came to overthrow the scene.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The fact that he literally appeared in the \"five\" conference shows his intention to surprise and impose his own agenda on intra -party developments. Asking Kasselakis to be \"upgraded\" to the leadership through elections at the base, he cancels the conference, in which he says he will not attend. Having the estimation that \"SYRIZA will fail in the forthcoming European elections\", he decides to open all the issues now.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is certain that whatever the options to follow, they will express all those housed today in SYRIZA-PS only to the extent that they will secure \"rule\". For every bourgeois political party, this is also the \"Lydian stone\" of its existence, otherwise centrifugal trends are followed. In the case of SYRIZA-PS and in the context of the internal confrontation, some still rely on its leftist characteristics and leftist traditions in general, despite its transformation into a party-organic part of the attack on the working people. No matter how much they sound like a bad joke, they reveal that they have not all resigned from their role in the disorientation and integration of the working people and youth into roads to the system. Especially in today's period, where students, farmers and workers are on the streets of resistance and claim. This, after all, has always been their \"passport\" for their participation in government management.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/syriza-ps-se-diarkh-yparksiakh-krish/", "type": "article", "title": "SYRIZA-PS in constant existential crisis-KKE (M-L)", "description": "Although everyone in SYRIZA-PS were attracted to his 4th Congress held from Thursday, February 22 to Sunday 25 February as a point of restarting and \"progressive counterattack\", it is certain, on the basis of developments that have not been intervened, will have.", "author": ["\u039a\u039a\u0395(\u03bc-\u03bb)"], "tags": ["ps955"], "subtitle": "", "categories": [""]}
