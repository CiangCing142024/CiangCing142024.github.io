The names of the official highs, discovered from the metadata of the confiscated devices of Mauro Cid, St. Giovani Pasini and Alexandre Castilho Bitencourt da Silva. With the new information, it is even more explicit the participation of military personnel from the active force in the agitation and scammers, different from the \u201clegalistic\u201d version that the high command of the armed forces propagandes over the troops.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Both colonels have a longtime career. Pasini was a student at the Black Needles Military Academy in 1997, where he graduated as an artillery officer. In 2022, he ordered a license from the force to try to be a state deputy in Rio Grande do Sul. Defeated, he returned to strength until February 2023, when he passed the reserve. Alexandre Bitentcourt graduated the same year as Pasini, also on Aman. He is active to this day and works in the General Department of Army Personnel.\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169774\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"540\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/f960x540-124970-199045-0-1708689158.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/f960x540-124970-199045-0-1708689158.jpg\" width=\"960\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Colonel Giovani Pasiani and Colonel Alexandre Castilho Bitencourt da Silva.

The generals also stated that the content did not correspond to \"majority thinking today in the troop.\" No evidence has been presented to corroborate the statement of the General, since the signatures were secret. Now, the first evidence about the letter proves that the\n  <strong>\n   writing of the letter, that is, the main initiative behind the document\n  </strong>\n  , in fact the document was the work of\n  <strong>\n   High Officers of Active\n  </strong>\n  .\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  The responsibility of the High Command\n </h4>\n <p>\n  There is no doubt that, in many key moments of the far-right coup agitation, the reserve generals have given a central role as spokesperson for military interventionism and even pressants for the culmination of the fastest and most open coup. This was the case of figures such as Villas-B\u00f4as, Augusto Heleno and, in recent years, Braga Netto.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But that does not mean that the active military summit has exempted itself from the coup articulation, much less than it is \"legalistic\". The last month revealed that generals from the Army High Command, such as Estevam Theophilo, former chief of the land operations command, were entirely inside the institutional rupture plans and even intended to command troops during the coup-part of them, from them\n  <em>\n   Kids therefore\n  </em>\n  , the special forces of the reactionary army. It is obvious that those who command and accept to participate in a blow, it is certain that they have troops willing to get weapons and be commanded, which puts the version of some generals about \"majority thinking today on the troops.\"\n </p>\n <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-169776\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"615\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/exercito-1024x615.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/exercito-1024x615.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Generals only differ in\n    <em>\n     how to make\n    </em>\n    e\n    <em>\n     when to do\n    </em>\n    the intervention.

They knew that in the barracks, the dispute between the plans of coup of the military right (a veiled interventionism in the institutions) and the far right was fierce.
