Recent developments are the \n sign of a growing march towards a general war that to \n end will lead to enormous losses of human lives and goods, including \n the environment. Usa imperialism is not leaving anything of intended \n to restore hegemony to his domain in the world and in particular in the \n Region full of oil from the Middle East and Western Asia.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   The United States have \n used their veto power on the Security Council for \n block any peace initiative in Palestine torn by \n war from the outbreak of the war. In fact, it proved to be \n A reliable ally and guidance of the Zionist colonial power \n State of Israel. The documents of US imperialism, which is \n full of wickedness and animosity, they have disturbed the semblance of peace \n throughout the area. The western powers were absolutely \n in favor of the moves of the Fascist Israeli State of Apartheid \n throwing petrol on the fire. The imperialist countries have been silent on \n genocides perpetrated by Israel on the Palestinian people for more than 100 \n days.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   On January 3 the war \n Israelo-Palestinese made its 100 days. In this war \n Genocida duration 3 months, orchestrated by Israel with help \n of US imperialism, over 25 thousand Palestinians of which most \n part are children and women, including elderly people, they are perite \n In this imperialist war by Prosecutor against the people \n Palestinian fighting for his state. The Zionist state \n of apartheid did not only limit himself to the killing of many \n Palestinians throwing white phosphorus bombs from the sky, but it is \n trained in the genocidal art of eliminating people by denying the \n Supply of basic necessities to live on this land. \n All these acts by Israel are equivalent to a genocide \n according to the law of the international convention.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   The PCI (Maoist) welcomes with \n favor and supports the action of South Africa at the Court \n International justice against the genocidal war of the state of \n Israel against the Palestinian people and for peace in the region. There \n position of our party is that there should be a peace \n immediate and all Israeli troops must leave Gaza and the \n West Bank. In addition, the United States and the other powers \n Western imperialists must give up military actions for \n Prosecutor in the Region and withdraw all military forces from \n region. Our party reiterates its request that states \n United retires their military support to Israel, who have armed \n up to the teeth with all types of modern sophisticated weapons and others \n logistical and intelligence supports. Recently, the Chamber of \n United States representatives approved the allocation of 14.5 \n billions of dollars in military aid for Israel in addition to supporting \n to Ukraine. All this money was used to finance the \n cycle of genocide that ultimately benefit the gigantic \n Weapons industries of the military-industrial complex.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   Today, western Asia is \n transformed into a laboratory for the global weapon industry. The \n United States have deployed its numerous nuclear aircraft carriers the \n our party requires withdrawal from all these Mediterranean waters with \n immediate effect. To regain his wandering hegemony in the \n Mediterranean region, the United States created a coalition of \n 20 countries in the name of the Prosperity Guardian operation. Under \n The umbrella of this rainbow coalition of allies \n US imperialism, the United States are launching attacks \n Planes in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Jordan. Such actions from \n part of the United States are not foreseen by the Convention \n international and in total violation of the sovereignty of \n those nations. Our party lies with all those nations \n oppressed and their peoples and their organizations that are \n opposing courageous resistance to imperialist provocative actions \n of the United States and the United Kingdom and are resisting with great \n willpower against the war sponsored by the imperialists \n against the Palestinian people.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   India, under the domain of \n Brahmanic forces of the Hindutva BJP-GRESS, has totally bent \n towards Israel going far ahead in showing an ideological unit \n between Zionism and the fascism of Hindutva. Level \n International, the Indian state under Narendra leadership Modi \n He abstained from the vote at the United Nations General Assembly on \n a resolution drawn up by 22 nations that asked for an immediate \n humanitarian truce. Indian state that had the presumption of \n be the self -proclaimed voice of the \"south of the world\" e \n \"Vishwa Guru\" and instead only supported in words the \n Request for peace and humanitarian support in Palestine. The PCI \n (Maoist) condemns this hypocritical position of the Indian state \n Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and launches an appeal to the people \n of the country to fight against the game of the two weights and two measures \n of the Indian state.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   More recently, in the context \n of the war in Gaza, the Indian state agreed to transfer \n 10,000 workers from India to Israel to replace the \n Palestinian workers paid in low wages. The unions of India \n they showed their protest against this measure of the state \n Indian. The PCI (Maoist) sides with the request of the unions \n to dismantle this immoral exchange of labor that exposes lives \n of Indian workers in serious threats in the war areas. The state \n Indian under the RSS-BJP regime is emulating Israel strongly and has \n established an indissoluble link with it. The Indian State with the \n Weapons and technologies of Israel has triggered hard repressions against \n The democratic voices and revolutionary movements of India. The state \n Indian is imitating the Israeli Zionist methods of repression \n Against nationality and oppressed masses in India. The CC of the PCI \n (Maoist) appeals to all mass organizations, for strength \n democratic, human rights activists and all sectors \n progressives to protest against the wicked alliance between India and \n The Zionist Israel.\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\" class=\"western\" style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  <span>\n   The CC of the PCI (Maoist) does \n appeal to everyone to build a militant mass movement against the \n genocidal war of the Israeli Zionist state against Palestine e \n to build movements for immediate peace and humanitarian support \n unconditional to the Palestinian people.
