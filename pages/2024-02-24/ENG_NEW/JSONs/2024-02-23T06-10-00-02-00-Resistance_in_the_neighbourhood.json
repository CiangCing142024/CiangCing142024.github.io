With perseverance and determination, against government propaganda and screams of the media, against blackmail of all kinds and slander, state repression and terrorism. But not only. In essence, the struggling sections of the people in today's phase are de facto confronted with their \"own\" deficiencies, with the internal problems of the movement, with the consequences of the defeat of the Labor-Revolutionary-Communist movement the previous century. These are what are expressed, among other things, in the various political and organizational obstacles set by the forces of compromise and subordination-with the KKE-, in their attempt to halt the momentum of these struggles and to integrate them into their parliamentary-election planning.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The big farm rally in downtown Athens on February 20th, the shocking demonstration of students on the 8th of the same month, both with the participation of thousands of people and youth, the dozens of other mobilizations, the blocks, the mass general meetings, the occupations They are the most degrading answer to all of them! Quite simply, because despite the serious and critical problems that have emerged in the context of the struggle, it turns out again and again that anger and indignation do not wait! The same is evidenced by the strikes of call centers, which discovered in the battle the importance of the trade union organization, with a union in the Teleperformance workshop.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The masses, after all, when they choose the path of the race, do so because they want to win, whatever the plans and calculations of those who appear each time as their \"leadership\". And there is also the best response to the screams of fatalism, to those who refuse the right of the people to fight out of their systemic standards, in the theory of \"futility\" and \"ineffectiveness\" of the struggles. It is precisely this will and need to be served by those forces that seek to strengthen the direction of the confrontation in social and political developments, against tactics and reformist submission, the line of departure and the closure of the fight. From this process this direction will arise and range, which as it strengthens, the more it will strengthen in turn and the prospect of victory of the movements.\n <br/>\n <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/oi-agwnizomenes-mazes-anoigoun-dromous-elpidas-kai-prooptikhs/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  follow up here\n </a>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Read on sheet 957 released on Saturday 24 February 2024:\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   Sheet contents\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    here\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Main articles\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/oi-agwnizomenes-mazes-anoigoun-dromous-elpidas-kai-prooptikhs/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    The world of exploitation is not invincible!\n    <br/>\n    The struggling masses open the ways of hope and perspective!\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/wmos-ekviasmos-gia-loutro-aimatos-kai-nea-nakba-sth-rafah/\">\n    Palestine\n    <br/>\n    Raw blackmail for blood bath and new Nakba in Rafa\n    <br/>\n    Will Rubicon cross the Zionist Israel?\n   </a>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n  </b>\n  <b>\n   <a href=\"https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/mporoun-kai-prepei-na-synexisoun-mporoun-kai-prepei-na-nikhsoun/\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Rural mobilizations\n    <br/>\n    They can and should continue!
