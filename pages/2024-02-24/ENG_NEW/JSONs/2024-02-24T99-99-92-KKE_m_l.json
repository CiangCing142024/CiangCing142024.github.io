And not only to farmers, breeders, beekeepers but also to students, teachers, healthcare, and even lawyers, there are many open fronts to face the government. With mass and multi -day mobilizations, but so far they have not been able to unite on a single front and force the government to retreat. And we have the \"paradox\" on the one hand that this popular dissatisfaction with government policy is inflated and on the other a non -existent opposition, a fellow opposition, which more functions as a crutch of the government than as a support and expressor of popular anger.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And we have another \"paradox\": farmers claim tax -free rural oil and appear as \"supporters\" of those who voted for the special tax on agricultural oil! Farmers to claim cheap rural stream and to \"support\" those who have privatized the energy and with their policy \"bum\" in profits with energy groups and private providers! Farmers fight against the new CAP 2023-2027 and against the reduction of the subsidies it brings and ... \"agree\" with EU and CAP supporters!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The extent and mass of the mobilizations show that the problems of the agrarian world are many and acute. Not only in a county or region, but nationwide. Not only for a product, but for almost all agricultural products. Not only the poor and medium -sized biopalarous farmers, but also farmers of the so -called \"agricultural entrepreneurship\", that is, farmers, that is, a large lottery, high income and large tractors, machinery and equipment. Extensive mattresses of Agrotia, thousands of rural households see their future erasing black and stupid, from a policy that is impoverished year after year, makes production unprofitable and leading to abandonment of crops, deserts the villages, calls the poor, and the production by neo-cliffs and neo-cigarettes and deepen the country's nutritional dependence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  What the government has announced is a challenge for farmers. The return of the EFK announced by Mitsotakis is only for 50% of consumption and is estimated at around 82m euros, when before the return of EFK and lower oil prices, the return of EFK was over 160m euros. And it is a real challenge of 82 million and at the same time the government says that \"we scratched the bottom of the barrel\", when in January alone, tax revenue exceeded 461 million euros in the budget target! Challenge is also the lowest prices for the rural current, as reduced prices only apply to 1/3 of consumption and only for farmers who have no debts and are members of cooperatives!\n </p>\n <p>\n  As for Thessaly, five months after the floods, not all compensation was still given, and the government still did not clarify how much the farmers would be compensated for their damaged production. Five months later and still damage to infrastructure, irrigation networks, etc. have not been repaired. At risk of thousands of acres remaining uncultivated and respected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the agricultural rally showed in the Constitution, the government's announcements did not convince the farmers. The government announced by the government do not reduce production costs, as farmers demand, nor do the crops viable. The government's announcements are \"ash in the eyes\" of the farmers and aim to break up the farm front. Various neo -democrats are also used for this, who after years have been \"reclaimed\" by the blockages and have a say in mobilizations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand, there are no more political progresses we had in earlier mobilizations. Few and degraded references to the CFP and the EU anti -grocery policy, the country's nutritional dependence and more. Thus, agricultural mobilizations can and are used by the government as a negotiating paper in the bazaars that have already begun EU to modify aspects of the CAP 2023-2027, below the pressure of the rural uprising we have in almost all Member States. Already, with the aim of individual changes to the CFP, a first meeting of 9 Mediterranean Member States (EUMED-9 Group) took place on 24/2 and follows a new meeting on 26/2 before the EU's Agriculture Ministers Council.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Will we continue after the Constitution? This is not the first time we had a tractor in the Constitution. We had a tractor earlier, in the distant 2016, February again, with a SYRIZA government at the time, with Prime Minister Tsipras and Bouta offering a gift to the Prime Minister a bottle of tsipouro. The tractors were then a 20,000, this year near 200. And then and now the rally took place with the government's consent and under the instructions of the Traffic Police. Then the rally in the Constitution also marked the end of the mobilizations. This year; Will blocks and mobilizations continue? Will they escalate? Will small and medium -sized farmers have real abuses? Will they put their own interests ahead or assign their struggles to the government to negotiate them at the various EU meetings? Despite the negative correlations, with the agricultural movement dissolved, without constitution, without procedures, with non -existent agricultural associations, the blocks have shown that they can squeeze the government, they can win victories. They can and should.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.kkeml.gr/ps957/mporoun-kai-prepei-na-synexisoun-mporoun-kai-prepei-na-nikhsoun/", "type": "article", "title": "They can and should continue!
