On January 30, 1943, the Commander of the German Military Forces of Europe, Lieutenant General Alexander Lerre, issued an order in which: \"Every resident of Greece aged 16-45 is obliged, when conditions demand, to take up a job for German or Italian or Italian Services indicated to him. Men's working forces are obliged to work outside their permanent place of residence if needed in camp communities. \" In essence, the issue of political recruitment was in the Greek people. The decree will be announced to the Greek people on February 23 on the day of the establishment of EPON. The Germans are planning and preparing the transfer of Greeks to German factories. It was a forced choice after their defeat at Stalingrad. On February 24, the mobilizations (workers' strike) began and the demonstrations against the recruitment. A gathering is being held outside the office of the occupation Prime Minister Mr. Logotetopoulos. Thousands of EPON young people participate in the front line. The protesters occupy the Ministry of Labor and burn part of his files. They get the foods that the Germans had gathered in the basement of the building. The following day, students of Athens are also demonstrated. The Italians will shoot and kill the Eponite student Yiannis Drakopoulos. On March 5th, EAM is organizing a general strike in Athens. More than 250,000 Athenian and Piraeus protesters enter the Ministry of Labor and burn the conscription statements. The main streets of Athens and Piraeus became a battlefield between the unarmed people and the occupation forces. At least 18 were dead and over 130 were injured. Similar mobilizations will take place in Thessaloniki, Volos, Kalamata, Sparta, Corinth and more. Thus the people of Athens and Piraeus, along with the rest of the Greek people who resisted, managed to cancel the political conscription attempted by the occupation forces.\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  The first sheet of the \"new generation\" describes the evolution: \"February 24th and March 5th! Yes, two dates that will remain historic. And unforgettable. Two days when the Athenian and Piraeus people with their youth fought and scanned the plans of the conquerors and imposed his will. The younger generation participated in unprecedented volume and militancy in these battles. March 5 was still the first baptism of EPON. A large demonstration of young girls and children crossed the central streets of Athens with screams \"BELOW THE CONSTRUCTION - EPON, EPON\".\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <b>\n   The armed struggle\n  </b>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  From the time of its establishment, the youth of the EPON actively participated in the armed struggle against the conquerors. The first rebel group consisted of 16 rebels (early 1943). In the liberation (October '44), the ELAS Eponite rebels reached 35,000. Over 8,000 were the select Eponite rebels who fought in the distinguished military sections. EPON guerrillas took part in 430 battles and killed over 1,300 Eponites.\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  But also in the cities (main in Athens) the Eponites fought with the Germans and the Battalions, so that in large areas of Athens they have been liberated and the Germans could not approach.\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <b>\n   The battle against hunger\n  </b>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  Also important is the battle that EPON fought to fight hunger. In the winter of 41-42, 300,000 Greeks died of hunger. Many were children. Winter 41 - 42 was one of the most difficult of the Occupation. 300000 were dead from hunger. The conquerors left nothing from the wealth that the country produced for the Greeks.

She wrote unparalleled pages of heroism during her years of action. He still inspires us and teach us. It tells us that youthful revolutionary, spontaneity, the rebellious spirit must be blown up with the prospect of organized struggle, politicization, the awareness of the role of peoples in history as the protagonists in building a new society. How the role of the youth should be highlighted on the side of the people and in many cases of the front and the inspirer of the popular struggles. It is reminiscent of Yiannis Drakopoulos, Panayiotas Stathopoulou, Koula Lili, Thomis Hadjithomas, Electra Apostolou. We are reminded of the three Eponites of the Castle of Ymittos. We are reminded of the heroic Lord \"Lord Byron\".\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3\u03a4\u0395\u03a6\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a3"], "labels": ["\u0395\u03a0\u039f\u039d", "\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/02/23-1943.html"}
