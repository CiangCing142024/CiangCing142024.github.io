   The Central Committee of the PCI 
 (Maoist) condemns the nefarious intent of the colonizer state 
 Zionist-Israeli and the western imperialist powers, 
 mainly the united US imperialists, to intensify the 
 war against Palestine and expand the horizon of war in 
 The whole area and western Asia. Recent developments are the 
 sign of a growing march towards a general war that to 
 end will lead to enormous losses of human lives and goods, including 
 the environment. Usa imperialism is not leaving anything of intended 
 to restore hegemony to his domain in the world and in particular in the 
 Region full of oil from the Middle East and Western Asia.

   The United States have 
 used their veto power on the Security Council for 
 block any peace initiative in Palestine torn by 
 war from the outbreak of the war. In fact, it proved to be 
 A reliable ally and guidance of the Zionist colonial power 
 State of Israel. The documents of US imperialism, which is 
 full of wickedness and animosity, they have disturbed the semblance of peace 
 throughout the area. The western powers were absolutely 
 in favor of the moves of the Fascist Israeli State of Apartheid 
 throwing petrol on the fire. The imperialist countries have been silent on 
 genocides perpetrated by Israel on the Palestinian people for more than 100 
 days.

   On January 3 the war 
 Israelo-Palestinese made its 100 days. In this war 
 Genocida duration 3 months, orchestrated by Israel with help 
 of US imperialism, over 25 thousand Palestinians of which most 
 part are children and women, including elderly people, they are perite 
 In this imperialist war by Prosecutor against the people 
 Palestinian fighting for his state. The Zionist state 
 of apartheid did not only limit himself to the killing of many 
 Palestinians throwing white phosphorus bombs from the sky, but it is 
 trained in the genocidal art of eliminating people by denying the 
 Supply of basic necessities to live on this land. 
 All these acts by Israel are equivalent to a genocide 
 according to the law of the international convention.

   The PCI (Maoist) welcomes with 
 favor and supports the action of South Africa at the Court 
 International justice against the genocidal war of the state of 
 Israel against the Palestinian people and for peace in the region. There 
 position of our party is that there should be a peace 
 immediate and all Israeli troops must leave Gaza and the 
 West Bank. In addition, the United States and the other powers 
 Western imperialists must give up military actions for 
 Prosecutor in the Region and withdraw all military forces from 
 region. Our party reiterates its request that states 
 United retires their military support to Israel, who have armed 
 up to the teeth with all types of modern sophisticated weapons and others 
 logistical and intelligence supports. Recently, the Chamber of 
 United States representatives approved the allocation of 14.5 
 billions of dollars in military aid for Israel in addition to supporting 
 to Ukraine. All this money was used to finance the 
 cycle of genocide that ultimately benefit the gigantic 
 Weapons industries of the military-industrial complex.

   Today, western Asia is 
 transformed into a laboratory for the global weapon industry. The 
 United States have deployed its numerous nuclear aircraft carriers the 
 our party requires withdrawal from all these Mediterranean waters with 
 immediate effect. To regain his wandering hegemony in the 
 Mediterranean region, the United States created a coalition of 
 20 countries in the name of the Prosperity Guardian operation. Under 
 The umbrella of this rainbow coalition of allies 
 US imperialism, the United States are launching attacks 
 Planes in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, Jordan. Such actions from 
 part of the United States are not foreseen by the Convention 
 international and in total violation of the sovereignty of 
 those nations. Our party lies with all those nations 
 oppressed and their peoples and their organizations that are 
 opposing courageous resistance to imperialist provocative actions 
 of the United States and the United Kingdom and are resisting with great 
 willpower against the war sponsored by the imperialists 
 against the Palestinian people.

   India, under the domain of 
 Brahmanic forces of the Hindutva BJP-GRESS, has totally bent 
 towards Israel going far ahead in showing an ideological unit 
 between Zionism and the fascism of Hindutva. Level 
 International, the Indian state under Narendra leadership Modi 
 He abstained from the vote at the United Nations General Assembly on 
 a resolution drawn up by 22 nations that asked for an immediate 
 humanitarian truce. Indian state that had the presumption of 
 be the self -proclaimed voice of the "south of the world" e 
 "Vishwa Guru" and instead only supported in words the 
 Request for peace and humanitarian support in Palestine. The PCI 
 (Maoist) condemns this hypocritical position of the Indian state 
 Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and launches an appeal to the people 
 of the country to fight against the game of the two weights and two measures 
 of the Indian state.

   More recently, in the context 
 of the war in Gaza, the Indian state agreed to transfer 
 10,000 workers from India to Israel to replace the 
 Palestinian workers paid in low wages. The unions of India 
 they showed their protest against this measure of the state 
 Indian. The PCI (Maoist) sides with the request of the unions 
 to dismantle this immoral exchange of labor that exposes lives 
 of Indian workers in serious threats in the war areas. The state 
 Indian under the RSS-BJP regime is emulating Israel strongly and has 
 established an indissoluble link with it. The Indian State with the 
 Weapons and technologies of Israel has triggered hard repressions against 
 The democratic voices and revolutionary movements of India. The state 
 Indian is imitating the Israeli Zionist methods of repression 
 Against nationality and oppressed masses in India. The CC of the PCI 
 (Maoist) appeals to all mass organizations, for strength 
 democratic, human rights activists and all sectors 
 progressives to protest against the wicked alliance between India and 
 The Zionist Israel.

 <p align="justify" class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">

   The CC of the PCI (Maoist) does 
 appeal to everyone to build a militant mass movement against the 
 genocidal war of the Israeli Zionist state against Palestine e 
 to build movements for immediate peace and humanitarian support 
 unconditional to the Palestinian people. The CC of our party invites 
 to organize and build mass militant movements in support 
 of the liberation struggle of Palestine and to punish criminals 
 of war Zionists.
