 trade union, social
 organizations and Marxist scholars who have joined the calls for the 
international and internationalist day of action against the wars of 
capital, and in support of the Palestinian resistance, in Italy, 
Argentina, Germany, Japan, India, Turkey, Congo, Bangladesh, United 
States, Brazil, Russia, Portugal, Greece, Holland, France, Mexico, 
Colombia, and other countries.
 <p>
  There are two appeals, with the same basic content: the need to
  <strong>
   constitute
 an international field of the proletarians and the oppressed completely
 autonomous from the capitalist-imperialist camps that are heading 
towards an apocalyptic clash of power
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   to get in the way of this race towards a new world war that can and must be broken.
  </strong>
  The differences between the two texts concern aspects to be discussed and explored, but overall secondary to this priority.
 </p>
 February 24th – we can now take it for certain – will be
 <strong>
  a first step in this direction
 </strong>
 with the squares of many large and small cities around the world where this same message will be carried:
 <strong>
  Down
 with the wars of capital! Let’s stop the race towards a new horrendous 
inter-imperialist global slaughterhouse! Long live the resistance of the
 Palestinians and of all those oppressed by colonialism old and new! 
Long live authentic proletarian internationalism!
