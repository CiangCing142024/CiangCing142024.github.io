  The outcome of the voting - the law now - for political marriage and the adoption of same -sex couples has been widely commented on by all aspects of the political spectrum. Before proceeding to our own valuation, let's remember the results: 175 in favor, 77 against, 46 abstentions and 2 present. In addition to the official positioning of any parliamentary political power, the serious differences - by many - recorded.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the New Democracy, in a total of 158 Members, 31 were abstained and 21 voted against. The so -called party discipline was not put. Voridis finally at the time of the vote ... "went for coffee"! In SYRIZA, where party discipline was put, we had a abstention and a present. Polakis had a… “surgery”! In PASOK there were 11 (!) Ladies. In the new left abstinence the 2 minority MPs did. Freedom navigation voted in favor of. They voted against the KKE, a Greek solution, victory and Spartans. They can be separated into two categories: in the far-right-fascist-fascist-religious, who saw a "burlot" on the foundations of religion and society, and in that of the bourgeois "regularity" and the family tradition that its leadership saw. KKE.
 </p>
 <p>
  First, the debate in Parliament was another reason for a new loud intervention by A. Samaras. For the third time and on equal issues lately, the former prime minister has openly made his vertical differentiation against the current ND leadership and government policy. Its purpose was and remains the far -right stream inside and outside the ruling party. He and his plus believe that the ND is "tilted" very much towards the "center", while "abandoning" the right. In the context of the right apartment building, it puts mortgages for the future, with the air of the far -right wave that is rising in Europe and beyond. It is another more formal systemic voice of intensity of the fascism of public and political life. The many times eloquent "no comment" by a government spokesman testifies, better than anything else, the size of the problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  A second issue is the dimension with the church that came from the government in the particular legislation. The leak for the so -called Hieronymos list targeting politicians on the part of the top ecclesiastical hierarchy is primarily recipient of the ND party and government officials. It is always open, of course, the issue of "consideration" by Maximus to calm. It is certain, however, that leaks to the far right will increase, based on the dark, reactionary and idealistic-metaphysical position of the priesthood and the influence he exerts on pieces of world. The look is already focused, elsewhere, in the European elections.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing for the government, however, is not this. It is - parliamentary in this case - inability to go through its policy based on its own "vigilance" majority. Such, in fact, that the votes of other bourgeois forces needed to become a law of the state. And from the beginning, seeing the difficulties in the government camp, they came to her side, regardless of the fuss they made for purely voting reasons. This 41% of every opportunity at every opportunity have been a bit proved to be a matter of an issue as central by Mitsotakis himself. It is a serious crack that, no matter how entertained by the end result, joys and festivals, may be kept in mind by the centers of the system inside and outside the country. Whether this is a temporary, ephemeral weakening and striking of the prestige for the ND remains to be seen.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is certain that the government is already trying to "rest" with a host of anti -labor and anti -populist measures that hit the social majority. In this respect, it is hard for urban media to try to give the ND party as a whole "progressive and modernizing" features when its policy, in the context of strategic attack on capital and imperialism against the working class and peoples worldwide And in our country, she already shows her teeth. Let them ask the student youth and the poor farmers about him…
 </p>
 <p>
  Some columnists associate the adoption of homosexual marriage with the condemnation of our country in the well -known European Parliament's resolution on the so -called rule of law. It became known that this issue was also raised, among other things, by the European Commission. No matter how much this is possible, Europe's "discontent" is first and foremost based on the fact that the boat of our country's dependence is overly "bored" with the Mitsotakian ND to Americans! Of course, recent options for equipment programs that have obviously unhappy French and Germans play a role. And not that the pain of the European Union for democratic rights and popular freedoms in our country. After all, it is the same as leading the strike of every right and conquering European peoples!
 </p>
 <p>
  Problems, moreover, that have emerged by the vote are not exclusively for the ruling party. We would say that all urban and reform formations are running. Both PASOK and SYRIZA have serious consistency issues, reflecting the conditions of instability as a whole of the political system. It was such that all the obvious and underlying imbalances that exist for many years now came to the surface and relate to the anxiety of the ruling class. And though for the far -right parties, their dark response was given, for the KKE and on the basis of the "justification" of his vote, he meant another example of the political tail in the bourgeois perception of things and relationships he has or wants to shape with The ruling class and the imperialist EU. Engels' bones will be tired of "the origin of the family ...".
 </p>
 <p>
  In conclusion, this law was a serious test test for the "level" - let's now - of the ruling class of our country and the socio -political formation it is leading. And it may, in the end, has finally moved on, with most of the "devotees" of this "reform" to act obviously hypocritical, but did not avoid turbulence and proved that there are serious portions of political and social, that even hate even every Cinema for the rights of all kinds of minorities. Those who, talking about workers, workers and people, can find equality and equality only in the context of another, socialist society. And this issue has undoubtedly a class sign!
