  Massacre at the Esselunga construction site, the imam speaks of "corporal": "half a salary to those who found work on the workers"
 </h3>
 <div>
  "Three Egyptian boys who worked on the construction site told me that, despite having a regular contract, they had to give half of their salary to those who had found them the job. They told me yesterday (Tuesday, editor's note) in the mosque, asking me if it was lawful In a religious sense not to give this money anymore. I told them that this is to be denounced "
 </div>
 <div>
  <b>
   According to the words of the IMAM, the three young people who would tell him the above events would have worked on the construction site for several months, "but there were those who had been hired for ten days, because it seems that the works were late".
  </b>
 </div>
 <div>
  ... he told how young workers were "upset" for the death of their colleagues but also desperate: with the stop of the works - the whole area is under seizure since yesterday on the disposal of the prosecutor - they have in fact lost their jobs.
