  </a>
  . The polls indicate that a large slice of Palestinians wants Barghouti to happen to Mahmoud Abbas as president.
 </p>
 <p>
  The National Security Minister of the Israeli of the far right 
 Itamar Ben-Gvir confirmed last Wednesday that Barghouti is in 
 "isolation". The move, he declared on X, took place after having 
 received "information about a planned ICIFADA [revolt].
 </p>
 <p>
  “Prevent lawyers from visiting [Barghouti] raises real fears 
 for his life, above all because insulation is accompanied by 
 direct and continuous incitements against him by the media 
 Israelis, "said Qaddoura Fares, head of the commission. 
 "The isolation of Barghouti is part of the aim of the target of 
 all prisoners [...] and leaders of the national movement in 
 captivity, through massive transfer operations, detention 
 collective and in isolation, in addition to systematic torture ".

  According to Fares, Ben-Gvir's declaration was “another 
 attempt to show off in front of public opinion 
 Israeli ".

 prison of Ramla and then to the Rimonim insulation unit, before

 premises to take on their responsibilities and to accelerate the work 
 visiting the prisons and to stop all violations against the 
 prisoners.
