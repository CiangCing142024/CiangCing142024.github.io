  The racing outbreak of Europe's farmers given his heterogeneity has managed to bring back the demands of this part of society. In particular, the poor peasant peasantry that is back on the road to its survival has gained wide popular support as it is understood that the attack is about all and the opponent is common.
 </p>
 <p>
  The cultivation of social automation from systemic centers aims to isolate farmers, to prevent popular support from taking sympathetic character, not to evolve into a frontal resistance against anti -populist politics. This is how all kinds of tricks, ladder and slander are recruited. Black as white as white for who are farmers, for their role in society and their struggle.
 </p>
 <p>
  The farmers are described conceivable as uneducated, far -right, who react to the so -called "green" EU policies for the European primary sector. They are blamed for not accepting Sur, the new agreement on the use of agrochemical supplies (pesticides). They do not, in the context of green transition, accept the restriction of the use of agricultural diesel, but instead claim cheap fuels and electricity to reduce production costs. In terms of livestock farming, they react to the new norms imposed by EU instructions to reduce animal waste. In terms of ideological attack, farmers and farmers, that is, the part of society that is by definition closer to nature and the countryside, are presented as a key responsible for environmental pollution and disturbing ecological balance.
 </p>
 <p>
  The infamous "green deal" of the EU is seeking "climate neutrality" by 2050 and affects agriculture and livestock breeding cuts in meat production, a reduction in nitrogen emissions, a ban on pesticides and a reduction of crops. The new EU guidelines, dressed in an ecological cloak, and in combination with the big ax in CAP subsidies, drastically change the map of the primary sector in Europe and what is produced, how and in what quantities.
 </p>
 <p>
  The so -called EU environmental measures are in fact integrated into a process of concentrating production, strengthening of monopoly portions, competition of large multinational disposition of agrochemical supplies. No relation to (non -existent) ecological sensitivities of the European elites. It is characteristic that to meet the EU's nutritional needs promotes imports of agricultural products from third countries, such as the recent major EU agreement with Latin American countries. Of course the imported foods that will fill the gap are produced without the "green" standards of the European Union, e.g. With uncontrolled use of pesticides, so consumer protection from any burdensome food goes for a walk ...
 </p>
 <p>
  This reinforces the nutritional dependence of the region countries, large zones (especially in the European south) are led to abandonment, while photovoltaics are subsidized in place of crops. The redevelopment of agriculture, as baptized the withering of fertile areas with significant productive potential, does not eventually lead to a reduction in biosphere infection. On the contrary, there is a space for the swelling of other branches (more profitable in the juncture) with ultimately more devastating effects on the balance of nature. In the name of green growth, the "green business" is finally refined to meet the need for capital for new profitability.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of this accelerates the process of popping up the poor peasantry, as fewer and more specific farmers can adapt to the new norms, and the small and middle producer is certainly decisive. It is this majority part of the rural world that is unable to manage the ever -increasing costs of farmers, which is deserted in the pressures of food trafficking, which is also accurately burdened with all kinds of popular consumption. Due to the high cost comes the poverty and ultimately the concentration of the clergy and the concentration of production for the benefit of the "big industry" that can operate in terms of capitalist production. Otherwise, where it is unprofitable comes the abandonment and the rhyme of the countryside.
 </p>
 <p>
  The consequence of the above is the decline in the quality of the product that reaches the table of the popular household. Access to pure organic foods with simplistic prices relates to a minority of the population only, while the mass is intended to consume plastic fruits from Brazil, Morocco oil and meat from Argentina.
 </p>
 <p>
  European imperialists do not give a penny for what we eat, but for who and how much they are earning from the process of food production and marketing. They are not interested in the environmental footprint, but who will be favored by the competition for the green business.
 </p>
 <p>
  The ecological problem that capital itself creates from its uninvited functioning is incorporated as a new field of profitability and competition between its portions. And so it shapes the terms not to solve it but to aggravate it. After all, commodity-headalist production presupposes not only the exploitation of living labor, but also the seizure of natural wealth. Within this process, the ecological balance and relationship of man to nature are disturbed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The large mass of the peasantry, called in the given framework to fight for its survival, is artificially loaded with the results of a process in which it is an object and not a subject. Its prospect lies alongside the working class, in the struggle for another society, where man and not profit will be at the center of production. In this perspective, a higher unity of man with nature can be produced, which is an integral part of it. The first raid on the sky produced data in this area as well, and the next cycle will certainly give even more!
