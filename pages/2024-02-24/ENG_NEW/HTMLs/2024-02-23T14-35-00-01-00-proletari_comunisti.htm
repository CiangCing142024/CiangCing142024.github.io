 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Speaking in this moment of the ex Ilva issue means talking about an extremely complex reality. We have addressed the question in different forms and recently, our companions in Taranto produced a brochure/document that could serve the workers to have their point of view on what was happening, based on class and class interests concrete analysis of the concrete situation.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now the thing has become even more complex and articulated.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 17.28px; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The first problem 
 is connected to the decision of the Meloni government and its ministers 
 who, after a series of internal contrasts, have stated, pressed 
 First of all from the confederal trade union organizations e 
 from the emergency created with the blocking of production activities from 
 part of the workers of the contract, with permanent principals managed 
 essentially by the masters and master of the contract they have 
 stopped the workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This has put 
 the plant in a situation of progressive non -operations, 
 until yesterday's news of the detention, already planned but 
 immediately implemented, with the change of governance, from the commissioner 
 who ordered the detention of the last althero -pounding still in operation. Yes 
 He says this stop will last 24 hours, it has never happened normally 
 So for previous stops and restarted. So in fact today the 
 factory is firm, both in its direct activity and in the contract.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Newspapers 
 they underline that it is the first time that it has happened in these forms and that 
 It does not seem to be the best entry card of the new management 
 Commissioner. If good morning you see it from the morning you could already 
 think about the worst hypotheses. The management has been accused 
 ArceloMittal to want to close the factory, send it to 
 I break by taking the markets, but the plant is stopped today that 
 Formally it is no longer managed by Morselli.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Among the many things 
 to say, however, must be highlighted above all those who have a 
 direct effect on workers and workers. On this the position of the 
 Slai Cobas is on the one hand coherent - it has always been the same in 
 course of these events, even the last ones - on the other is currently 
 an objectively countercurrent position, after the decision of the 
 government to put the Ilva in extraordinary administration, greeting 
 Let's say with enthusiasm battered by trade union organizations 
 Confederal and the USB.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We can never 
 forget that the majority union within the 
 plant, the UIL, very influential throughout the affair 
 of the contract, in recent days he said no to the Administration 
 Extraordinary. Today, however, everyone says yes, from those enthusiastic to 
 Those who however consider it an inevitable passage.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Slai Cobas for 
 The class union which is the union organization of agent towards 
 The steelworks, the contract and the workers in AS instead clearly says 
 that the extraordinary administration is a worse remedy for evil.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, nobody in 
 factory will regret Morselli and the Mittal management also on the plan 
 of the image, of the relationship not only with trade union organizations, 
 but with the union as such as the expression of workers, 
 Compared to how they dealt with all the problems within the 
 factory, and that for this Morselli had been made sign of one 
 growing dispute. We consider the main one that took place 
 on May 6, 2022, if we are not wrong, in which the workers were 
 On strike in a massive way, they contested Morselli who came in 
 arrogant and provocative way to the event in front of the 
 gates of the concierge A and on that occasion the workers, united 
 In a real strike, they seemed to have the knife on the side of the 
 handle. We think that the continuity of that struggle, in the forms 
 in which he was raised, he would have allowed the minimum much earlier the 
 realization of many things that were then made, but 
 Above all he would have constituted a brake and an alternative.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In 
 that occasion the unions promised directly to the workers, ai 
 gates, including us, who would follow the assemblies 
 generals to give continuity and press on this.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Among other things, in 
 Those opportunities we asked explicitly, also for our active role 
 had in the dispute of Morselli, who was discussed in the 
 assemblies a working platform, however signed by hundreds 
 of workers, who could be a common and general base of the 
 position of workers with respect to ArcelorLelMittal, governments and 
 also to future governments. But nothing was done. You can think 
 all the evil possible of this, but in substance it did not do it 
 Nothing.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today we are at a 
 terminus. Mittal leaves the management of the company and will start a 
 judicial procedure that we think will also have an indirect influence 
 on subsequent developments. But the alibi of the government and who is 
 Behind they ended and this is right and necessary. Which have been 
 the social forces that supported this line that the government today 
 has it implemented? First of all, the Federacciai - the owners of the steel - has 
 Supported this position with the aim of putting hands on Ilva 
 at zero cost and with the money of the state. This has been said more 
 times by the president of the Federacciai who, we do not forget, is one 
 of the strong candidates for Bonomi's succession to Confindustria.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So they are the 
 the owners of the steel the fundamental subject behind this 
 operation. And there is no doubt that this is also reported 
 from the appointment of the commissioner. This is a story on which in 
 next days it will be necessary to clarify especially among the 
 workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As it comes 
 told, for example by the daily fact, it seems that two 
 issues are irrefutable. Forty, the new manager, say that 
 For several years in Ilva, long before Mittal and in this case 
 staying long before Mittal is having many more responsibilities than 
 What happened to the Ilva of Mittal herself. This appointment - 
 The newspaper says - was advocated by the president of the 
 Federacciai, Antonio Gozzi. Not only that, but why this appointment? 
 Why forty? It was the manager who represented for years 
 The Ilva in Federacciai.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Secondly, 
 It remained. Forty in all these years has changed the roles, 
 But he has always remained inside the figures, as he is said to him on 
 newspapers, "apical", that is, of the summit of this company, including 
 The management of the Ilva Study Center. It was also the director of 
 institutional relations of the group. On the great question of the dead 
 at work and environmental disaster caused by the factory. AND' 
 Forty who in his role as director had said about the relationship 
 Paths that nailed the Ilva to his serious, enormous, responsibility 
 on the emissions that have produced pollution and death in the city 
 and in the neighborhoods, that there is "a great question in the 
 relationship between cause and effect ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Allow us to 
 having a legitimate doubt: but this was the line of conduct of 
 All the lawyers of the Riva group and its allies in the trial 
 Educational environment who had their contact person in forty for 
 question the polluting effect of deaths, diseases, as well as 
 deaths at work, produced by the Ilva management, both in the period 
 preceding the coming of Riva and above all throughout the path of 
 Shore.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Forty has 
 held several positions even after the seizure of the plants 
 of 2012. One of the commissioners appointed by Renzi, commissioners appointed 
 to impose a production continuity against the investigation of the 
 Judiciary - that of Pietro Gnudi - had as effect 
 immediate that forty has been promoted as central director 
 of the steelworks operations, a charge that he held for about a 
 year. But then it is not that disappears, goes to the technical division 
 operational, participate in all subsequent events also as 
 Commissioner of the Ilva in AS, that is, the one that took place after the entrance of 
 Mittal.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this is the 
 minimum. Because there are other news that are actually hidden, 
 We must read them today only on the daily fact and are part of the 
 historical memory of those who have fought in recent years against the 
 factory of the dead at work. Forty had two sentences 
 definitive and not for the procedure that did not go on of which 
 There is talk, relating to the death of a child from cancer, well known to 
 Taranto and in the anti -pollution battle, little Lorenzo, but for 
 significant deaths within the plant that took place in 
 years of shore.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Forty was 
 definitively sentenced, together with four other defendants, for 
 The death of the two young workers, Paolo Franco and Pasquale D’Ettorre, 
 of which we talked so much and clearly we will come back to speak because 
 they marked the history of this plant, killed on June 12th 
 of 2003 for the collapse of the arm of a crane in the parks area 
 minerals of which forty was responsible at the time.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The second 
 Quaranta condemning he had it for the death of another young man 
 worker, Marco Perrone, another significant death because you are 
 treated a young worker hired a few months earlier with a 
 Work training contract. And the worker, in July 2002, fell 
 during cleaning operations, stuck in the gears of 
 conveyor belt. The new Commissioner of Ilva was acquitted of 
 first degree on this, but the sentence was overturned on appeal and 
 confirmed by the Cassation.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's measure ourselves between 
 what the trade union organizations immediately said 
 confederal and the actual figure of the new commissioner.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So we have 
 a thousand and a reason to say that it is the choice of the administration 
 the appointment of this commissioner are extraordinary, they represent not 
 A change but a restoration. A restoration of the Ilva 
 worse. Of course, we will be the first to hope that this is not the case, but 
 If we look from the point of view of what it would mean that “not 
 be so ”, we have serious doubts and we think the workers must 
 think, count to 10 before speaking, and not only the 
 trade union organizations but also workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We continue to 
 To say that the concrete signal is the return to the work of the workers 
 of the contract and their regular payment of salaries. Instead on 
 This we think that the extraordinary administration is not 
 At the height of making this, at most it is the sowing of one 
 new mountain of layoffs, on the other hand in one dimension in 
 which or this layoff in derogation covers all workers 
 or half of these workers also loses the right to 
 go to layoffs and some companies are already announcing 
 which, however, are not of the game of continuity but are of the 
 game to see to recover money.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The workers of the 
 Steel mills cannot find in these decisions other than the 
 relaunch of the social amount of layoffs.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Attention: it was 
 The theme of clash against Morselli and the Management 
 Arcelrmittal. The additions, semi -permanent, unilateral coffers, 
 After being accepted the first, then they were contested, on 
 to which there was a real contrast, albeit without concrete effects 
 in the real clash between workers and masters.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Administration 
 extraordinary fulfills these additions coffers, indeed, it will foresee 
 much more systematicly. And the layoff was 
 become a strong contrast theme, because without any support of 
 integration destroyed the workers' salary, brought i 
 workers from 300 to 500 € less per month in general. In the contract 
 He already produced layoffs.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's obvious 
 So then the effects on safety, if you think or are of the 
 logic - that we contrast at all levels - that this 
 plant should be closed and transformed into iron scrap, this is 
 a position, or who thinks this is a disaster for the workers 
 and for workers, for the future of the city, etc. etc. 
 know that there is no guarantee that there will be a recovery 
 maintenance, safety for those who still have to stay 
 in the plant.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the effects 
 pollutants we will express ourselves later, but the figure of forty is not 
 calm, certainly.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is on the basis 
 of these facts that we can express the clear judgment on the 
 choice that the Meloni government made with the agreement with the unions 
 Confederal and USB included. And on this it will touch once again 
 to the workers to choose which side to be on: on the part of the government, of 
 future new masters who look a lot like the old man, than on the plane 
 General will present a copy -like plans to those of ArceloMittal, 
 on the side of confederal unions that have become an assignment ring 
 collaborative and neocorporation that identifies in the solutions for 
 the masters the solution for workers, when the whole story of 
 This factory shows that this is the cause of that 
 which happened; or the workers choose the reorganization of the workers' files, a 
 starting from their class interests, from an opposite vision on the 
 future of the factory, which is then the future of the working class first of all as a historical subject that can be the element of 
 transformation of units between workers and popular masses in this 
 factory and not only in this factory, but in general.
