November 9, 2019. In its ruling, the Supreme Court rightly expressed the view that the Babri mosque was not built after a demolition of a pre -existing temple, and further stated that its demolition on December 6, 1992 was a \"blatant violation of the rule of law\". However, all the culprits of the demolition of the Babri mosque left with a clean register and were praised by Prime Minister Monti as great patriots and freedom fighters. See L.K. Advani that led the Ramjambhoomi Rath Yatra movement\n  <a href=\"#10\" name=\"top10\">\n   <sup>\n    10\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  resulted in the plunder of the mosque of Babri and the slaughter of thousands of innocent lives. This is the magnitude of the parody of justice in the fascism of the Brahmanic Indian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While the fascist forces were busy with their sad, hated and divisive agenda, all of us aware citizens were not able to show our moral vigor in a collapsing world. All of us were more or less victims of this mass fascist program. So fascism works, implicitly and secretly, call the aesthetics of fascist techniques.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the rise of imperialism, that is, at the time of financial capital, the nation-state that emerged with developing capitalism, became an obstacle to the free movement of capital. However, in fascism that appeared in the 20th century with imperialism and the crisis of capitalism, the concept of nationalism was perceived by the fascist forces through the lenses of the purity of race and blood. Thus, the racist and cultural fascist nationalism emerged that builds internal borders and opposite poles between the ego and the other in the nation. In such doctrines of cultural nationalism are RSS and BJP\n  <a href=\"#11\" name=\"top11\">\n   <sup>\n    Eleven\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  who try to impose a single exclusive identity based on religion, language and culture. Everywhere in the world where this chauvinist-patriotic\n  <a href=\"#12\" name=\"top12\">\n   <sup>\n    12\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  Nationalism has usurped political power, has caused serious damage to democratic structures and has imposed a strong oppression on working masses with the helping hand of imperialism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Following the footsteps of Savarkar, BJP identifies the interests of imperialism and the main form of Hindu nationalism (Hindutva). The pioneering leaders of Hindutva were in collusion with British imperialism. Today, in the name of cultural nationalism, BJP and RSS deliver the nation's resources to imperialist forces and play their miserable game to impose a one -dimensional culture of Brahmanic Indian. As a result, BJP and RSS have used nationalism to create rifts in society and surplus in corporate houses. Jingoistic nationalism in India since its inception in 1925 has been by -product of fascists Hindutva. Together with Prime Minister Monty, all the status quo promoted the construction of the Temple of Rama as a national glory, the heyday of \"Indian culture\" and as an act of nationalism that cannot be canceled\n  <a href=\"#13\" name=\"top13\">\n   <sup>\n    13\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the aim of expanding its social base and tackling the increasing influence of communism, RSS has taken various actions, of which the primary was the formation of many mass organizations. In 1948 he founded the Panindian Student Council (Akhilya Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sangatan, ABVP), a student body whose primary goal was to combat communist influence on Indian universities. In 1952 he founded Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram with the aim of confronting Christian organizations and the conversion and conversion of the tribes by Christian missionaries. Behind it their main agenda was to incorporate antibodies\n  <a href=\"#14\" name=\"top14\">\n   <sup>\n    14\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  in Hinduism. At the same time, RSS formed a political party, Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS) (which in 1980 changed and became Bharatiya Janata Party, BJP) to conquer political power with its Hindu nation agenda (Hindu Rashtra) , which revealed his cultural nationalism. In 1955, he founded the Association of Indian Workers (Bharatiya Mazdoor Shang, BMS), a workers' union to weaken communist influence on the India working class. In 1964, in close contact with Hindu clergy, the RSS formed the Hindu World Council (Vishwa Hindu Parishad, VHP) which played a prominent role in the forging of the module between various Hindu heresies and inherited a \"central structure\" in a hitherto .\n </p>\n <p>\n  All of these organizations showed strong perseverance/determination in their fascist movements that were identified/associated with specific groups/communities and played a decisive role in the destruction of the Babri mosque. Today these organizations have hundreds of thousands of members and thousands of annexes are spreading their tentacles across the country. This is a serious issue that is of concern to all democratic and revolutionary forces in the present context.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The RSS did not hesitate to express its support to the Congress Party in the 1984 general elections, as the latter used India and policies identical/ related to specific groups/ communities much more effectively than ever - character, the way or style followed the principles of secularism\n  <a href=\"#15\" name=\"top15\">\n   <sup>\n    15\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  . In a highly charged political atmosphere, where religion was used in exclusive and party terms\n  <a href=\"#16\" name=\"top16\">\n   <sup>\n    16\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  The RSS has returned to the news the issue of the Rama Temple that has been in lethargy for many decades. Specifically for this purpose, Bajrang Dal was founded in the summer of 1984 in the state of Uttar Pradesh, as VHP's militant wing. Its members were recruited by the inferior castes and the unemployed/ underemployed young people, who became the Hindutva infantry. Within a few years the estimated members amounted to about 100,000 young people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the collapse of Soviet Russia's social-imperialism in the early 1990s, the Indian economy went into deep crisis as the Indian ruling classes became heavily dependent on Soviet capital. There has been a serious crisis in the balance of payments. This provided fertile ground for the infiltration of IMF and World Bank policies in India. The entire Indian economy paved the way for foreign capital and began the phase of what is popularly known as Liberation, Privatization and Globalization.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In order to conceal/camouflage the forthcoming social and economic crisis, in conflict with imperialist forces, organizations of the main form of Hindu nationalism (Hidutva) seduced the Indian masses into panic -stricken policies\n  <a href=\"#17\" name=\"top17\">\n   <sup>\n    Seventeen\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  . In the 1989 general elections, the BJP reached 85 seats in the House of People's Representatives\n  <a href=\"#18\" name=\"top18\">\n   <sup>\n    18\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  , from 2 seats in 1984. After completing the RAM RATH YATRA, in the 1991 general elections, the BJP managed to concentrate 119 seats. It won the majority of seats from which the Rath Yatra march was passed. The 1991 elections were one of the most expensive elections in India's political history, where all political parties were engaged in a nasty game of cockroach to influence the vote of the various communities.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The majority and fascist use of religion in politics in exclusive and party terms from RSS-BJP led to the slaughter of Godra\n  <a href=\"#19\" name=\"top19\">\n   <sup>\n    19\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  in 2002. With the BJP's rise to power in 2014, the use of religion in politics in exclusive and partisan terms has intensified. One thing that has clearly happened in the last decade is Hinduism\n  <a href=\"#20\" name=\"top20\">\n   <sup>\n    Twenty\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  of politics in India. No one can deny this with complete political consciousness!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The establishment of the Rama Temple brought to the fore the issue of the creation of a protection shield for fundamental concepts such as nationalism, secularism, democracy and citizenship by the ruthless attack of the fascism of the Brahmanic Indian. But by simply preparing ourselves to become guardians of these ideas/perceptions that today define the essence of being human, we provide weak protection to these ideas/perceptions. What is currently needed along with protection is to critical thinking and restructuring these ideas/perceptions to give them greater durability.\n </p>\n <p>\n  RSS mechanisms are aware that the cultural sector is constructed and shaped by those political objectives that decisively contribute or influence the formation of political situation and promote their success. Giving Hinduism elements from prophetic-directing religions\n  <a href=\"#21\" name=\"top21\">\n   <sup>\n    21\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  And organizing it on a basis has been built by fascism Hindutva a culture that promises a psychological unity in the Hindu Religion endowed with great diversity.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today we can see this effort to move on rapidly by obscuring other social identities such as class, caste and sex. These social identities must be oppressed by Hindutva forces as they create movements that transcend religion and are an obstacle to the ideology of Hindutva. RSS-BJP classifies citizenship based on the primordial character of religion. That's exactly what Savarkar says\n  <a href=\"#22\" name=\"top22\">\n   <sup>\n    22\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  , about who are citizens of India, when it declares that only those whose sacred land and the land of their ancestors is India are considered as true citizens of that country.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Declaring in national media \"from God to the country and from Rama to Nation\"\n  <a href=\"#23\" name=\"top23\">\n   <sup>\n    23\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  , Prime Minister Modi openly revealed to the whole world his agenda for the Hindu nation. Further, Prime Minister Modi stated that \"God made me a means of representing all the people of India during the establishment\". This is nothing but a fascist theory of God's righteous rule.\n </p>\n <p>\n  And Hitler cultivated such a religious passion to maintain his control over the masses. Monty and Hitler, political gods, look very much.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The regime left parties welcomed the attitude of the Congress Party to boycott the event at the Temple of Rama as an ideological attitude that indicates characteristics of \"cosmicism\" that Nehrou was pronounced and supported. \"\n  <a href=\"#24\" name=\"top24\">\n   <sup>\n    24\n   </sup>\n  </a>\n  .

The case is considered one of the legal milestones in the battle to protect the rights of Muslim women. While the country's Supreme Court supported the right to nutrition, the ruling triggered a political battle and a dispute over the extent to which the courts can intervene in Muslim personal law. The case put the ground for the Muslim Women's Struggle for equal rights to marriage and divorce in regular courts. \n Later, in 1986, the Rajiv Gandhi government brought the law on Muslims mainly to annul the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling.\n                         <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-is-shah-bano-case-4809632/\">\n                          https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-is-shah-bano-case-4809632/\n                         </a>\n                         <a href=\"#top26\">\n                          <sup>\n                           \u21a9\n                          </sup>\n                         </a>\n                        </div>\n                       </div>\n                      </div>\n                     </div>\n                    </div>\n                   </div>\n                  </div>\n                 </div>\n                </div>\n               </div>\n              </div>\n             </div>\n            </div>\n           </div>\n          </div>\n         </div>\n        </div>\n       </div>\n      </div>\n     </div>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n  </div>\n </pa>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u039a\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1", "\u03b9\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1", "\u039a.\u039a.\u0399\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\u039c\u03b1\u03bf\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc)", "\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/04/blog-post.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
