A few years after the previous attempt to evacuate the occupation, the MATs stormed again, making 8 appeals. The previous time they had even sent the arrests to trial and it remains to be seen how today's appeals will evolve.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today's government move is not in the void. It also adds to the great list of expressions of state terrorism and repression especially of the last period.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To refer only to the most recent, the mobilizations come out illegal (a recent example of the conviction of the ELME Chania trial), teachers are being prosecuted for their trade union (ELME Piraeus), students are arrested because they are occupied against private universities (49 ) or disciplinary (Patras), demonstrations are hit by repressive forces, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At a time when poverty salaries, the scan of basic folk conquests in education, where the country's involvement in the war of imperialists in Palestine and Ukraine must be accepted by the people, the conquest of Rosa is not interpreted. different. The main issue is not the commercialization of a monument, nor is it a vice of today's government to throw wood.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They want to send a message that anyone who resists will be prosecuted!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Above all, the legislative arsenal is sharpened so that unions can decor the employer, student clubs lose their racing characteristics, demonstrations with police permission. To unlawful any voice that resists the road against imperialist-capitalist barbarism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The system with its law and order policy fascistizes public and political life. Every day and in every way he targets any voice that questions, resists, fights against his policy.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Our disagreements with the A/A movement on the movement and the more comprehensive answers required are a given. But the answer to state terrorism is not about the narrow boundaries of a political space but it is a matter for every democrat, every popular man.\n </p>\n <p>\n  To defend democratic rights and freedoms!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's decisively strengthen the struggles for life and work with rights! Let's fight against the policy that entangles us in the wars of the imperialists!\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <b>\n   XANIAN RESISTANCE\n  </b>\n </p>\n <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>", "description": "", "author": ["an.ba"], "labels": ["\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac", "\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7", "\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/04/xania.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
