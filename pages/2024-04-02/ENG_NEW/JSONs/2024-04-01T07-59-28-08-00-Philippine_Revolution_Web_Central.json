This was a statement by KS on the occasion of the party's 55th anniversary. According to such a statement, problems in the field of revolutionary armed struggle have been the result of ideological superstition. \u201cIn the failure to take the path of development of the people's war, specifically from the first part to the middle part, and from the median to the next part, not a few NPA guerrillas have been stopped and spoiled for a long time in the time Old levels, \u201dhe said. The party leadership said these mistakes and shortcomings resulted in the failure of many NPA units that Strongly expand the guerrilla fields in accordance with the line of comprehensive and intense guerrilla warfare on the basis of expanding and deep mass base. KS calls for recovery from failures and re -establish the mass base. In order to dominate previous mistakes and shortcomings, KS has set the following duties: \u2022 The Party must strengthen its leadership in the NPA \u2022 It should be advisable to advise the armed struggle, the agrarian revolution, and the launch of anti-anti-anti-anti-masses campaign feudal as a means of developing a mass base \u2022 Exercises should be launched with red commanders and - 12 - <br><br> Warrior \u2022 Build large-scale guerrillas \u2022 Launch a basis or antihon tactical offensive that can win \u2022 Continue to strengthen the Platoon as the BHB unit unit, and build the command structure at all levels \u2022 Boost the branches and Party Committee in the People's Army and the political organs within the NPA at all levels \u2022 Further strengthen, train and enable the units of the people's militia, the self-defense units of the revolutionary mass organizations are strengthening the strengthening of the NPA and armed struggles are associated with the Party's Party Advanced Movement to correct the mistakes, weaknesses and shortcomings of ideology, politics and organizations. \"In the next one or two years, it must be fully advanced and completed at all levels from the Central Committee of the Party to all the branches of the Party,\" according to the Central Committee. 200 families, the Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan January 2, 2024 until January 6, the Authority of the Freeport Area of Bataan (AFAB) has only a recent Narra Dormitory resident in Barangay Maligaya, Mariveles, Bataan for leave. Residents are evacuated because FAB expansion will cover the area. - 13 - <br><br> According to a statement by the FAB (NMFAB) united worker, at least 90 joint police, barangay and afab police were rushed to the Narra Dormitory on December 21 and were told they were running away. The \"notarized waivers\" also allegedly signed residents who stated that AFAB was \"without any responsibility\" to the affected residents. They allegedly paid \u20b1 200 per waiver. \u201cAFAB has no consideration to the people of the Mariveles. They use the power beyond the ability of the local government and explicitly violate the rights of each Marivele\u00f1o, \u201daccording to the NMFAB. The group of workers warned that not only the Narra Dormitory would be affected by demolitions and eviction as there would be more FAB expansion in accordance with the FAB Expansion Act. According to Jaime Azores, a former vice-president of the Narra Lodgers Association, \u201cWe are forced to sign a waiver saying that we are agreeing and leaving the area. [AFAB] also threatened that if we did not sign the waiver they were investing, we would be fired by electricity and dismissed immediately. \u201d \u201cIn our fear, the crowd signed up even though it was against our will. Are you the AFAB Police? How do you feel? \u201d Azores added. - 14 - <br><br> Residents of the Narra Dormitory lived in the area for decades. They pay \u20b1 320 per room per month as a rent. It was built during the time of the Marcos dictatorship for the housing of workers in the Bataan Export Processing Zone (BEPZ) which is now known FAB. \u201cI've been here for 44 years and most of us have had family and grandchildren. Then let us go? We will be taken to Alam, we will pay \u20b1 1,000 to the lowest rent, far from our work, \u201dAzores emphasized. The NMFAB has called on fellow workers and the democratic sectors to support the Narra Lodgers Association and its members. According to the group, \u201cIt is not fair to evict the dismissal of approximately 200 families of the Narra Dormitory. This incident is a violation of their right to live decent and peaceful. \u201d They insist that many will be affected by this incident not just the workers who endure the poor income and the young people attending school. The local government of Mariveles and Bataan should act for the well -being of the workers and the poor. FAB is called a special economic zone in the government's hold that gives companies incentives for - 15 - <br><br> Investment, which is often at the expense of workers and the poor.

Breaking the AFP's international human law in the Aerial Bombing campaign, January 16, 2024 The International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP) group criticized the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in international humanitarian law ( IHL) in its launch of excessive and superior strength attacks and aerial bombing campaigns against the small and vulnerable structures of the New People's Army camps (NPA). \u201cThe ICHRP strongly condemns the disproportionate use of weapons of 403rd - 55 - <br><br> Ibde, the AFP's 4th ID at its aerial bombing on December 25 to December 26, 2023 in Malaybalay City, Bukidnon, \u201dsaid Peter Murphy, chairperson of the coalition. He said it shows the AFP's open disrespect for human rights and international humanitarian laws. According to a preliminary report of the New People's Army (NPA) unit in Bukidnon, the tactical air wing of the 4th ID dropped four bombs at a temporary army camp in Barangay Can-Ayan, Malaybalay City. Two days later, it was again bombed in the New Society, Barangay Linabo in Quezon town. The drop of 250-free bombs, which sow terror at Bukidnon's people, was exaggerated. The Bombing in Malaybalay City killed 10 individuals in the NPA camp. According to the report, the body of the victims was devastated by the excessive strength of the AFP bombs. The AFP also used the atmos 2000 that it bought in Israel. The use of strong bombs is \"natural indiscriminate\" or selectively, at risk for the lives and livelihoods of civilians and causing widespread environmental destruction. In fact, the impact of the AFP bombing from the air is beyond the ground zero. It destroyed peace, caused extensive fear, panic and troma to residents in nearby communities and - 56 - <br><br> Destroying the forest that they are a source of food and livelihood. Besides, the IchRP criticized the attack and the 59th IB shooting at the People's Army in Barangay Mallay, Balayan, Batangas on December 17, 2023. Five red fighters and two civilians, Pretty, were killed here Sheine Anacta (19) and Rose Jane Ilga (30). The two of them were visiting the red NPA warrior of the NPA. According to a NPA report, Pretty Sheine was killed in the first explosion of fascist troops, before being killed by the military. Rose Jane's situation was disgusting when she saw her body at the cemetery where her pants were lower, she was exploited. Meanwhile, the military has not been arrested and to this day the wounded warrior Baby Jane Orbe (Ka Seed). In accordance with the rules of international humanitarian law, his rights of rival armed forces should be recognized. \"In its use of excessive strength and sowing of gloom to local farmers in these offensives, the AFP violated the IHL and showed a open disregard for the people's well-being,\" Murphy said. He added that these violations are more surprising to the rules of warfare - 57 - <br><br> Following the recent indication of the government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) to re -negotiate with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), representing 18 revolutionary organizations including the NPA. Murphy emphasized that these brutal rules in the countryside are part of the US-Marcos regime's anti-insurgency strategy that uses forced rides, hygiene and reconciliation of communities, counterfeit and forced surrender to civilians, arbitrarily arrests, abductions and despair, torture and extra- judicial ones murder. \u201cIn the face of this AFP's brutality in its war against the NPA, the ICHRP has reinforced support for the Filipino people's call for real solutions to the armed taglian in responding to its roots including widespread poverty, unemployment and jobs and those Industry, and the unfair distribution of land, \u201dMurphy said. Aerial strikes of the US and UK in Yemen, the ILPS-USE January 17, 2024 condemned the International League of Peoples' Struce-US the attack of US imperialism and the United Kingdom in the country and the Yemen's citizenship. - 58 - <br><br> \"We stand for the right of the Yemeni people, not only to defend their land, but also to their right to help the Palestinian people, who are both defending their land,\" according to an ILPS-US statement on January 13. Using War and cannon planes in the warships, the US bombed 60 targets at 16 areas on January 11. According to the ILPS, the US attack began when it fired Yemeni ships in the Red Sea which accused it Hosting \u201dcommercial ships on the Bab Al-Mandab Strait located on the northern part of the ocean. The Yemeni government refuted it, saying it was only targeting the ships to Zionist Israel in contributing to harm its war machine and contributing to the Palestinian struggle. \"There is no damage to Yemen's steps to the people or property, while US bombings have killed 15 people and destroyed infrastructure,\" the group said. Also, these bombings have brought widespread alarm throughout the country that has long been degraded to the world's worst humanitarian crisis due to the unlucky bombing of the US, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates since 2014. According to the United Nations, according to the United Nations, to 21 million Yemeni or - 59 - <br><br> 2/3 of the population relies on humanity to live. BHB-Sorsogon, clarified in a series of encounters on January 14 January 17, 2024 The New People's New Army (NPA) -Sorsogon denies some of the 31st IB's statements in connection with the release of this incident series in Provinces on January 14 . According to the unit, some of the encounters and released seized military equipment are all lie. The Red Army said the 31st IB and its unit in Barangay De Vera, Donsol on January 14 at 6am. There is no NPA-Sorsogon unit in the area so the alleged encounter is impossible. The alleged weapons, magazines and other military equipment in the area have been planted evidence, the unit said. Meanwhile, the unit insisted that no one was seized or seized any weapon in the encounter that took place in Barangay Sigg, a jungle in Sorsogon around 2:45 pm that day. It is also not true that the surrender of two red fighters of the people's army in Barangay San Isidro, Bulusan in the 22nd IB. The - 60 - <br><br> Named \"Johnny\" and \"Ganda\" were civilians forced by soldiers to \"give up.\" The unit honored red commander Baltazar Hapa (Ka Patrick) who was killed in a 31st IB attack in Barangay Togawe, Gubat, Sorsogon on January 14 at 6pm. Victims of the 2nd IB shooting, charged and detained January 17, 2024 State forces arrested five civilians in Masbate last week. Five Jamara Tumangan, Rowel Hagnaya, Alden Tumangan, Rico Cuyos and Senen Dollete are accused of red fighters who have encountered 2nd IB in Barangay Balantay, June 16, 2023. The victims denied it and insisted , in fact, they were civilian victims of soldiers' shooting. This shooting has resulted in the death of their 17-year-old Rey Belan. The victims were hunting in the jungle when they were met and a bullet was fired by a 2nd IB operating troop around 3:35 pm. Residents and relatives of the victims had earlier denied the military show that an \u201cencounter\u201d occurred in June 2023. - 61 - <br><br> No more justice for Belan and his colleagues, the victims are now arrested, the NPA-Masbate said. \"Under the Military Law in Masbate, the victim becomes criminal, and the criminal becomes the victim,\" said Ka Luz del Mar, NPA-Masbate spokesman. According to Ka Luz, the 2nd IB did this to cover up their heinous crime and bend the truth. \"The revolutionary movement fears that not only Belan, Tumangan and colleagues will experience this blasphemy but also the other victims and their relatives,\" he said. The NPA unit in the province has announced that it will strive to provide justice to the victims of the fascist military rule. Filipino workers who have lost their jobs in New Zealand, insisted on the same assistance January 17, 2024 Unified workers in New Zealand have not been able to provide them with a wages when the company that contracted them suddenly closed. At the same time, they pushed the Philippine embassy to bring out the help and assistance they deserve. - 62 - <br><br> More than 1,000 workers, including 495 Filipino workers, lost their jobs when the Ele Holdings Ltd declared a bankcrupty (bankrupt Large Manpower Agency employed temporary migrant workers. Many of these have been allowed to work in the country with the validity of temporary visas, and thus threatened to be home if you do not get a new visa and work immediately. According to Migrante Aotearoa, only 46 of the Filipinos who sought help from the Philippine embassy received a financial assistance on January 13. Workers were struggling with their condition, and families who relied on them in the Philippines were also struggling. Today, the First Union and Union Network of Migrants (UNEMIG) are helping them for their basic needs such as food and so on. Ele workers who were in the Philippines still did not receive any help when it closed. \"Most of the Ele (Ele (have announced) they do not want to return to the Philippines because they know there is no work available for them there,\" Migrante-Aoteroa said. \u201cThis is a huge wake -up call to the Philippine government that should ensure that it has - 63 - <br><br> decent jobs in the country, and stop the labor export policy especially but it is not ready to provide urgent assistance to OFWs and their families at times when they need government protection and services. \u201d On January 19, Ele workers will gather in three areas in New Zealnad (Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch) to defeat Ele and the Philippine government to provide the wages and care for them. Weapons and Canadian and UK military presence in the Philippines in the Philippines, the Marcos JR regime will not allow the Marcos Jr regime to allow troops, weapons and military equipment in the Philippines, as well as Canada and the United Kingdom will also allow it under the cooked military agreements between it and the aforementioned countries. An agreement with the \"Enhanced Defense Cooperation\" or EDCA is said to be \"repaired\" between the Philippines and Canada, according to Gilbert Teodoro Jr., secretary of the Department of National Defense on January 16. It will be signed in the first room of the year. Similar to the EDCA of the country in the US, it has been able to prohibit the construction of military bases, piling weapons, and the entry of nuclear weapons. Also chasing - 64 - <br><br> Canada is its own Visiting Forces Agreement that will surely provide the same privileges to American troops today in the country. Like the US EDCA and the VFA in the Philippines, the Marcos JR puppet regime will surely allow the long -term presence of Canadian foreign troops. A military treaty requires consent of the majority of the Senate. The Senate ruined the last such treaty, the US-Philippine Military Bases Agreement in 1991, which kicked US forces at its large military bases in Subic and Clark. In the VFA, the Philippines has no authority for American soldiers entering the Philippines, despite committing crimes. They also have extra-territorial rights to their \"EDCA sites\" that are none other than military bases. The Philippines and the UK will also have a \"agreement\" to allow the presence of the late troops to the US Wargames on the country's land on the country's land and sovereignty over the next five years. ADB's role in false transport modernization, criticized January 20, 2024 - 65 - <br><br> Youth protesting in front of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at the Ortigas Center in Mandaluyong City, led by the League of Filipino Students, to criticize its role in false modernization of transportation and phase-out of traditional Dyip. The ADB is leading the blame for traditional jeepneys as a pollutant, the cause of traffic, non -efficient and harmful to the health of the computers. ADB is pushing for \"safe,\" \"clean\" and allegedly affordable buses to be imported from Japan, US, Korea and even in China. This scheme is best in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) program that is being pushed by ADB in Davao. It has lent $ 1 billion to the local government to replace buses, jeepneys and tricycles that drive the city of over 1,000 euro-5 compliant bus and run-operated by Japan-Japan and Korea electricity. The \"transformation\" of the entire transportation system of Davao will begin in 2024. ADB and Japan are approved of the BRT as a program that will lower the Philippine Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emotion and \"low carbon\" transportation. This is also the case that the Office of the Solicitor General submitted in response to the Piston group's petition to stop the PUVMP nationwide. According to the OSG, the phase-out of jeepneys is part of the Philippines' climate commitment to lower its GHG emotion. - 66 - <br><br> In the National Capital Region and other parts of the country, followed by the forced consolidation of the franchises to buy the drivers and operators of the very expensive minibuses of Japan or Korea, or other electrical-operated electric machines -Us. Because the Philippines does not have its own industry in the manufacture of entire vehicles, or even machines and parts, it will need to import important parts, otherwise full vehicles. \u201cDrivers and operators will only do business and income on ADB's lending or official assistance to the PUVMP veil by selling imported modern jeep , \u201dSaid Elle Buntag, the group's general secretary. To date, the majority of the country's buses are imported from Japan. In 2021, the country imported buses worth $ 206 million from Japan, China ($ 21.7M), South Korea ($ 2.7m), Vietnam ($ 526,000), and United Arab Emirates ($ 45,300). Japan is also alerted to the machines of traditional jeepneys (large-scale-Isuzu, Mitsubishi and Toyota) that such companies now want to replace \"cleaner\" minibus. - 67 - <br><br> The Philippines is also a huge dump of used vehicles or segunda mano and old models of Japanese vehicles. \u201cThrough the ADB, it searched for a backward town that they could be able to sell and sell the aforementioned [uniform vehicles]. Due to the lack of accessible and accessible public transportation, the Philippines found a huge potential market for their super products, \u201dhe added. ADB is a multilateral state dominated by the state and Japanese capitalists. It serves as a part of the World Bank in the Asian region in pushing imperialist policies. PISTON: The country's climate commitment has nothing to do with the force of the franchise of the January 20, 2024 Consolidation of the Drivers and Operator Nationwide (PISTON) unity of the Office of the Solicitor General in the petition of the drivers' petition and jeep operators filed in the Supreme Court against the forced consolidation of franchises that are against the principle of independent organization. In the response of the OSG, which represents the DOTr and LTFRB in the case, the PUV Modernization Program (PUVMP) allegedly aims to keep promises - 68 - <br><br> of the country to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions or dirty smoke emitted by the country. Asked by the Piston, what does the PUVMP's mandatory franchise consolidation have to do with the dedication of the Philippines' climate commitment or the country's promises? \u201cThe DOTr and LTFRB insist on franchise consolidation, which will eventually result in the seizure of large cooperative and corporate businessmen with the ability to buy at least 15 minibuses per route, has nothing to do with any climate response,\u201d the group said of drivers and operators. \"This will only result in the intense loss of occupation of drivers and small operators and the explicit seizure of large corporations in the control of our public transportation.\" PISTON noted that UN Special Rapporteur for Climate Change Ian Fry recommended that the state develops a policy for a fair transport transition to protect workers' rights in decent employment. The piston and the steering wheel of the steering wheel repeatedly emphasized that the PUVMP and forcibly consolidating the livelihood of small drivers and operators. - 69 - <br><br> \"Franchise consolidation is not needed to improve the public transportation system,\" Piston said. \u201cWe can adjust and develop the tragic state of public transport in the country without breaking the rights of drivers and small operators in decent work. \u201d \"The OSG's response and the PUVMP's attempt to block our petition in the Supreme Court simply reveals the true purpose of the Marcos regime in pushing the PUVMP,\" Piston said. With the exception of providing the seizure of large bourgeoisiers in their livelihood, drivers and operators also know that PUVMP will allow the pile of sarplas minibus, machine, parts and other products from the US, Japan , Korea and even in China. Like the OSG, these countries, in particular Japan, also enjoy climate change by laying a \"low carbon\" transportation. If only the \"climate commitments\" were to talk about, the issue of the greenhouse gas of traditional jeepneys in the country's main culprits in the country is far from far away. According to the June 2023 Climate Action Tracker report, the main increasing GHG emotion in the Philippines is the energy sector, which is mainly in the coal -run plant. - 70 - <br><br> Also, instead of the state reducing the country's overall dependence on fossil gas, it even allowed large bourgeoisie to build an additional seven lng (liquid natural gas) terminal for imported lng from the US, which is the number one exports Lng all over the world. Three of these have operated from 2023. The Philippines contributes 0.48% to the GHG emotion worldwide. On the other hand, 2.6% of the Global GHG comes from Japan and 14% in the US. 2 Farmers, 62nd IB killed in a fake fake encounter January 21, 2024 Pickled and tortured, before the 62nd IB soldiers killed two farmers in Barangay Sag-Ang, La Castellana, Negros Occidental on January 17am.

Oldest Political prisoners, the regime did not include the release of the holiday season January 22, 2024 - 81 - <br><br> The brother, a group of relatives and friends of political prisoners, did not include 84-year-old political prisoners Gerardo Dela Pe\u00f1a on the list of releases during the holiday season despite his old age and illness.

Fides Lim, a brother's spokesman, said the fair implementation of such a resolution should be ensured. \"There is no part of an 84-year-old in the very crowded conditions of the New Bilibid Prison,\" Lim said. Lim also criticized his conflicting statements of Governo officials. He said an official of the Department of Justice announced that the two elders had benefited from the resolution, including Dela Pe\u00f1a. But when the brother visited January 15 at the dungeon, Dela Pe\u00f1a showed the BPP list that refused to give him executive clemency. - 82 - <br><br> \u201cWhy was he not joined by more than 1,000 prisoners who were released in December? Is it because he is a political prisoner? Or is it just a number of statistics in the slow -headed bureaucracy? \u201d Asked Lim. He insisted that all prisoners should be given to the plot and fair justice regardless of their political status. Dela Pe\u00f1a is the eldest of up to 800 political prisoners who are now confined to various country dungeons. Since 2019 the brother has been pushing for the release of Dela Pe\u00f1a but the state has repeatedly abandoned it.

The 13 farmers were among the thousands who had gone to Mendiola to call on former President Cory Aquino to implement real land reform. According to the group, there was a fundamental problem under the current US-Marcos regime of landslides by the majority of Filipino farmers. \"It is clear that it has no policy and land reform program,\" the farmers added. This is the strict basis for why the struggle for real land reform should be tireless, as farmers fought 37 years ago. \u201cOn the basis, the fight for real land reform - that the central goal and basic principle are free distribution of - 84 - <br><br> Land - is against the entire Filipino people, \u201dthe KMP said. In the theme with the theme \u201cPeace be at peace! True land reform, fight, \u201dinterim chairperson of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) negotiating panel Ka Julie De Lima.
