In this case the port is located in Ma\u00f3, Menorca, and it is being used since April of last year as a support base for the NATO operations and there are no limits or restrictions for using this port. Its main uses are\n  <em>\n   \u201cdissuasion and protection before terrorist attacks, knowledge of the sea surroundings or the development of regional\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   abilities\n  </em>\n  <em>\n   of security\u201d.\n  </em>\n  According to the\n  <a href=\"https://elpais.com/espana/2024-03-29/menorca-se-convierte-en-base-naval-de-la-flota-de-la-otan-la-tercera-en-espana-tras-rota-y-cartagena.html#\">\n   bourgeois press\n  </a>\n  , this base would serve as support in case of having attacks as the ones which the Ansar Allah, \u201cthe Houthis\u201d, are carrying out in the Red Sea. This port is in short distance from ports that are in Africa and outside of NATO\u2019s territory, as the Alger\u2019s port, Algeria. Thus, Ma\u00f3 joins the other two Spanish State\u2019s ports, C\u00e1diz and Murcia, which currently are giving support tot the alliance dominated by Yankee imperialism.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Together with the port, this year it is expected that the Spanish State will provide with more resources to the Operation Sea Guardian, as a submarine, a maritime vigilance plane, a frigate, a supply ship and a patrol ship with special operations equipment to act in case of crisis. The amount provided by the Spanish State to this military mission is of 27 millions of euros, and the overall amount provided to the NATO is of 200 millions of euros.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The revolutionary newspaper Servir al Pueblo highlights social-democracy\u2019s, which in 2023 was in the government which was defined by themselves as the \u201cthe most progressive government in the history\u201d, bankruptcy. However, they did not hesitate to hide purposefully the giving of this base to the NATO even from the local bourgeois government, which now has heard the news. Now the same social-democrat Parties express their \u201c\n  <a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/espana/agencias/2024/04/01/sumar-traslada-a-defensa-su-rechazo-a-una-base-de-la-otan-en-mahon-es-una-temeridad/\">\n   disapproval\n  </a>\n  \u201d due to the militarization of the country. They are trying to avoid the fact that they were in the government when the whole operation was prepared. Servir al Pueblo also highlights the involvement of the false PCE (the so-called \u201cCommunist\u201d Party of Spain) in the whole operation as was and is part of the government:\n  <em>\n   \u201cwe must remember that the usurped and false PCE of Enrique Santiago is part of the coalition Unidas Podemos. If the General Secretary of the PCE shown his big hypocrisy when he declared that \u2018we are against the NATO but Spain has international compromises\u2019, now we see this increased.\u201d\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p>\n  With these examples we see the militarization of the imperialist States. The Spanish State is not the only European State which increases its ties with NATO and Yankee imperialism. For example, we recently reported on the increase of US military bases in Norway and the Finland\u2019s membership to the NATO:\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-the-red-herald wp-block-embed-the-red-herald\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YURcCrynB1\">\n    <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2024/02/28/more-us-military-bases-in-norway/\">\n     More US military bases in Norway\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"YURcCrynB1\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://redherald.org/2024/02/28/more-us-military-bases-in-norway/embed/#?secret=E6Dl7OtXeZ#?secret=YURcCrynB1\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"\u201cMore US military bases in Norway\u201d \u2014 The Red Herald\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-the-red-herald wp-block-embed-the-red-herald\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qbtV4Fk2CN\">\n    <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2023/04/01/turkey-approves-the-nato-membership-of-finland/\">\n     Turkey approves the NATO membership of Finland\n    </a>\n   </blockquote>\n   <iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"qbtV4Fk2CN\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"338\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" scrolling=\"no\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://redherald.org/2023/04/01/turkey-approves-the-nato-membership-of-finland/embed/#?secret=gu5HPbeJ11#?secret=qbtV4Fk2CN\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"\u201cTurkey approves the NATO membership of Finland\u201d \u2014 The Red Herald\" width=\"600\">\n   </iframe>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n</div>", "pdf_content": "", "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/04/01/spanish-imperialism-gives-up-another-port-to-nato/", "type": "article", "title": "Spanish imperialism gives up another port to NATO \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "As the newspaper from the Spanish State, Servir al Pueblo, reports, the Spanish State, tool of Spanish imperialism, has given up another port to the NATO, which will use it as military base.", "modified time": "2024-04-01T20:27:37+00:00", "author": ["T.I."], "categories": ["Europe", "Featured"], "tags": ["NATO", "Spanish State"], "sections": ["Europe", "Featured", "NATO", "Spanish State", "English", "pll_660b190bd88a0"], "source_name": "Red Herald"}
