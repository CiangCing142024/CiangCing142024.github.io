  Following these first significant victories of the movement 
 student against the current genocide, the Italian government of extreme 
  right fears an "terrorist" and "brigatist" danger inside 
 of the University. In many cities the student events in 
 solidarity with Palestine have been attacked with sticks by 
 police.

   <span>
    Aware 
  of how much cultural propaganda is one of the armed arms of the 
 repression precisely for its ability to penetrate common sense 
 of the people, let's start by responding to the last thesis we have 
 reported, that of Padellaro.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    There 
  word aphasia in the Italian vocabulary is defined as follows: loss of the 
  ability to understand and compose the language resulting from injury 
 of the central nervous apparatus, partial impossibility or total of 
 Remember the signs of the word.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    Speaking of aphasia, here are some well -argued clarifications.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    From 
  years is reported within the universities to intensify 
 of the movement of the centrality of knowledge as a place of peace 
 to knowledge for war purposes. How many of us know that in addition to the PNRR 
  Is there a PNRM (National Military Research Plan)?
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    The 
  central role of the university system for strengthening the 
 military sector is also emphasized in the programmatic document 
 2020-2022 of the Defense General Staff.

    Denouncing, 
  criticizing these collaborations with precision and wealth of 
 arguments the result of collective and dialogical research and one 
 vision of knowledge at the service of humanity that suffers and not of the rich 
 arms merchants, we are beating for a future that for ours 
 children and for the planet earth does not foresee the war, massacre of 
 peoples and the environment and profits for millionaires.

 that "terrorists", we are the most sincere interpreters of a Constitution 
which with its Article 11 repudiates war, a Constitution born from the 
Resistance and the struggle against the Nazi-Fascist occupation.

 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    When 
  The so -called intellectuals speak of research ethics, of the 
 neutrality, autonomy, democratic freedom (therefore to 
 service of the people) of the University, as they may think that the 
 war culture propagated by these foundations and practiced by 
 reported agreements has nothing to do with the massacres of Gaza and 
 With the winds of world war?
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    As 
  We can not think of the dead children in Gaza, who in just 5 months are 
 more than all those who died in all wars in the world in 4 years (from 
 2018 to 2022)?
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    We remember 
  that Italy has sold armaments to Israel between 2013 and 2022 for 
 120 million euros which are now used in the genocide of 
 Palestinians. Collaborations with universities, foundations 
 cultural of the large arms industries have not played any role in 
  their development?
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    In
 letter signed by almost 2000 Italian professors and researchers and sent 
to Minister Tajani on 29 February, calling for a stop to the 
collaborations with Israel it is said that "
    <em>
     the financing could 
 be used to develop 'dual use' technology, or employment 
  both civil and military, and the third line of financing of 
 Optical technologies could be used to develop devices of 
 latest generation surveillance, also for war use. The request 
 of the letter is to suspend the agreements until the fire of 
 Israel.

 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    The Appeal
 calls for a freeze on relations between universities and 
the two countries' research in order to put pressure on Israel, such as 
it was done against Apartheid South Africa. This kind of struggle is 
clearly incomparable to fascism, to the "
    <em>
     Lugubre time in which professors were expelled from universities because Jews
    </em>
    "As the well -known Fassino declared.

    About Israeli universities such as "
    <em>
     place of dissent
    </em>
    ”, 
  taking into account the exemplary exceptions that often happen to us 
 tell and enhance, we ask ourselves some questions about the structures 
 General:
    <span>
     <a href="https://contropiano.org/news/internazionale-news/2024/03/31/la-facolta-di-scienze-repressive-della-hebrew-university-0170866">
      Are Israeli universities fully free?
     </a>
    </span>
    Neutral places of democratic comparison, of critical thinking?
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    A 
  First example: the well-known Palestinian Prof Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian 
 (expert of feminisimi and gender violence) has just been suspended for 
  Order of Hebrew University and detained for hours at the airport Ben 
 Gurion. In October he had signed a letter with 1000 academics 
 internationals who asked for the ceasefire and the end of the regime of 
 Apartheid.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    We will deepen these questions in the next episode.

  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    Meanwhile, one "one"

    </b>
    : over 4 thousand students, 231 teachers and school workers were killed. The universities of Gaza are destroyed.

    The Maeci call was published on November 21st and expires on April 10th.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    Let's continue 
  to fight, to extend, make the 
 struggles, with the strength of our in -depth reasons by a dialogue of 
 continuous research and our great feelings.
   </span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
   <span>
    We do not leave the Palestinians alone. Let's stop the genocide!

   <span>
    We thank 
  The Assembly of Trento in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance to the 
 which we participate for the many ideas of deepening we have 
 developed together in a commitment of common struggle.
