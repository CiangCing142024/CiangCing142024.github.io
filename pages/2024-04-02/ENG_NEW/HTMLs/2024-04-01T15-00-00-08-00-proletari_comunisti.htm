 </p>
 <p align="justify" class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  His political activism and the events that involved him have 
 made of anan a sort of hero in Palestine, therefore an element 
 dangerous for the Israelis, who found in the Meloni government 
 The perfect accomplice to continue killing the Palestinian people 
 And to repress his resistance without making too much noise.

   But the so -called
  </span>
  “Operation against the

 center -right government and politicians, it is nothing more than an operation 
 repressive for which people accused of nothing arise, because

   who justify 
 This operation has never occurred in our country.

 </p>
 <p align="justify" class="western" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  What justifies it, on the other hand, is the ill -concealed attempt to do not

 Palestinians against the colonial occupant, repress and 
 criminalize

  The right to resist, even with weapons to the occupant, is a 
 right not only collective but also subjective, widely

   Palestinians are the God of terrorism. From 1948 to now we are below 
 the attack of Israel who kills us every day, but still today 
 We claim freedom, which we will conquer without ever stopping. 
 Because it is our land and the Palestinians deserve to be free 
 and live like all the other peoples of the world.
