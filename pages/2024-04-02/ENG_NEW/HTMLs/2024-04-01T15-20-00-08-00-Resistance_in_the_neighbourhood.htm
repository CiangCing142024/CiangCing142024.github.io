  Fascism has its peculiarities, so it varies in forms and bears specific characteristics in different real conditions. In the specific conditions of India, the nature of fascism is the fascism of Brahmanic Indian (Brahmanical

  Fascism).
 </p>
 <p>
  The rise of the forces of the Movement for India (Hindutva) in political power is essentially harmonized with the fake Indian Parliamentary Republic.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even in this unprecedented moment of glorious glory, Hinduta's paramilitary units dressed in yolk colors do not show such a serious threat to the parliamentary system because the latter proves to be a real threat to their own kingdom, the kingdom of the kingdom. Hate (Kingdom of Animosity). Something that raises a serious question about the constitution of parliamentary democracy itself.

 </p>
 <p>
  The establishment of the Rama Temple, with all the wave of fans and the sensuality of the media, unintentionally managed to normalize the injustice suffered by the Muslim minority due to the demolition of the wonderful historical mosquito Babri by Hinduva's raids. The fact that there was imperative support of the event at the Rama Temple by the Muslim community is so impunity.

  Prime Minister Monti's report, on the day of the Rama Temple on January 22, that Rama's birthplace was free from hundreds of years of disaster is in direct opposition to the Supreme Court's ruling on Agiona. November 9, 2019. In its ruling, the Supreme Court rightly expressed the view that the Babri mosque was not built after a demolition of a pre -existing temple, and further stated that its demolition on December 6, 1992 was a "blatant violation of the rule of law". However, all the culprits of the demolition of the Babri mosque left with a clean register and were praised by Prime Minister Monti as great patriots and freedom fighters. See L.K. Advani that led the Ramjambhoomi Rath Yatra movement

  resulted in the plunder of the mosque of Babri and the slaughter of thousands of innocent lives. This is the magnitude of the parody of justice in the fascism of the Brahmanic Indian.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the fascist forces were busy with their sad, hated and divisive agenda, all of us aware citizens were not able to show our moral vigor in a collapsing world. All of us were more or less victims of this mass fascist program. So fascism works, implicitly and secretly, call the aesthetics of fascist techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the rise of imperialism, that is, at the time of financial capital, the nation-state that emerged with developing capitalism, became an obstacle to the free movement of capital. However, in fascism that appeared in the 20th century with imperialism and the crisis of capitalism, the concept of nationalism was perceived by the fascist forces through the lenses of the purity of race and blood. Thus, the racist and cultural fascist nationalism emerged that builds internal borders and opposite poles between the ego and the other in the nation. In such doctrines of cultural nationalism are RSS and BJP
  <a href="#11" name="top11">

  Nationalism has usurped political power, has caused serious damage to democratic structures and has imposed a strong oppression on working masses with the helping hand of imperialism.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the footsteps of Savarkar, BJP identifies the interests of imperialism and the main form of Hindu nationalism (Hindutva). The pioneering leaders of Hindutva were in collusion with British imperialism. Today, in the name of cultural nationalism, BJP and RSS deliver the nation's resources to imperialist forces and play their miserable game to impose a one -dimensional culture of Brahmanic Indian. As a result, BJP and RSS have used nationalism to create rifts in society and surplus in corporate houses. Jingoistic nationalism in India since its inception in 1925 has been by -product of fascists Hindutva. Together with Prime Minister Monty, all the status quo promoted the construction of the Temple of Rama as a national glory, the heyday of "Indian culture" and as an act of nationalism that cannot be canceled

  With the aim of expanding its social base and tackling the increasing influence of communism, RSS has taken various actions, of which the primary was the formation of many mass organizations. In 1948 he founded the Panindian Student Council (Akhilya Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sangatan, ABVP), a student body whose primary goal was to combat communist influence on Indian universities. In 1952 he founded Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram with the aim of confronting Christian organizations and the conversion and conversion of the tribes by Christian missionaries. Behind it their main agenda was to incorporate antibodies

  in Hinduism. At the same time, RSS formed a political party, Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS) (which in 1980 changed and became Bharatiya Janata Party, BJP) to conquer political power with its Hindu nation agenda (Hindu Rashtra) , which revealed his cultural nationalism. In 1955, he founded the Association of Indian Workers (Bharatiya Mazdoor Shang, BMS), a workers' union to weaken communist influence on the India working class. In 1964, in close contact with Hindu clergy, the RSS formed the Hindu World Council (Vishwa Hindu Parishad, VHP) which played a prominent role in the forging of the module between various Hindu heresies and inherited a "central structure" in a hitherto .
 </p>
 <p>
  All of these organizations showed strong perseverance/determination in their fascist movements that were identified/associated with specific groups/communities and played a decisive role in the destruction of the Babri mosque. Today these organizations have hundreds of thousands of members and thousands of annexes are spreading their tentacles across the country. This is a serious issue that is of concern to all democratic and revolutionary forces in the present context.
 </p>
 <p>
  The RSS did not hesitate to express its support to the Congress Party in the 1984 general elections, as the latter used India and policies identical/ related to specific groups/ communities much more effectively than ever - character, the way or style followed the principles of secularism

  The RSS has returned to the news the issue of the Rama Temple that has been in lethargy for many decades. Specifically for this purpose, Bajrang Dal was founded in the summer of 1984 in the state of Uttar Pradesh, as VHP's militant wing. Its members were recruited by the inferior castes and the unemployed/ underemployed young people, who became the Hindutva infantry. Within a few years the estimated members amounted to about 100,000 young people.

 <p>
  With the collapse of Soviet Russia's social-imperialism in the early 1990s, the Indian economy went into deep crisis as the Indian ruling classes became heavily dependent on Soviet capital. There has been a serious crisis in the balance of payments. This provided fertile ground for the infiltration of IMF and World Bank policies in India. The entire Indian economy paved the way for foreign capital and began the phase of what is popularly known as Liberation, Privatization and Globalization.
 </p>
 <p>
  In order to conceal/camouflage the forthcoming social and economic crisis, in conflict with imperialist forces, organizations of the main form of Hindu nationalism (Hidutva) seduced the Indian masses into panic -stricken policies

It won the majority of seats from which the Rath Yatra march was passed. The 1991 elections were one of the most expensive elections in India's political history, where all political parties were engaged in a nasty game of cockroach to influence the vote of the various communities.

 <p>
  The establishment of the Rama Temple brought to the fore the issue of the creation of a protection shield for fundamental concepts such as nationalism, secularism, democracy and citizenship by the ruthless attack of the fascism of the Brahmanic Indian. But by simply preparing ourselves to become guardians of these ideas/perceptions that today define the essence of being human, we provide weak protection to these ideas/perceptions. What is currently needed along with protection is to critical thinking and restructuring these ideas/perceptions to give them greater durability.

  Today we can see this effort to move on rapidly by obscuring other social identities such as class, caste and sex. These social identities must be oppressed by Hindutva forces as they create movements that transcend religion and are an obstacle to the ideology of Hindutva. RSS-BJP classifies citizenship based on the primordial character of religion. That's exactly what Savarkar says

  On the one hand, Congress and the left parties disagree with the involvement of religion with politics, on the other hand defend secularism by giving explanations of religious character.
 </p>
 <p>
  The CC India (Marxist) [CPI (M)], in the English-speaking weekly newspaper Peoples Democracy, argued that "but the main reason why the" anti-Induist "category is not strictly because Puri Govardhana Peeth, Jyotir Math, Dwarka Sharda Peeth and Sringeri Sharda Peeth - have made known their intention not to participate in the ceremony in Agiona on January 22. " These four Sancarages have previously supported the Hindu nation in the main media.
 </p>
 <p>
  If this is the case, the Congress party and the left parties try to show that they are no less Hindus than the BJP.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Aam Adami Party, which is a member of the United Opposition alliance called India, conducted/took part in religious broadcasts/programs in 70 constituencies in Delhi, just before the establishment of the Temple of Rama. All regime political parties were immersed in this "opium", as Carl Marx called religion.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not very difficult to predict that the issue of the General Elections of 2024 will revolve around the religion and the Temple of Rama. There will be a huge/intense polarization of society against the backdrop of religion by the political mechanisms of RSS and BJP. We are completely headed towards a Middle Ages under BJP's rule.

  And at the same time, the license to perform rituals by the right -wing Hindutva wing to the controversial mosque of Babri triggered the religious outburst/wave that eventually swallowed/flooded the entire nation.
  <p>
   By laws related to the Uniform Civil Code, CAA and NRC, the Indian state under BJP has made its apathy/indifference clear even in terms of typical secularism as guaranteed through the Constitution.
  </p>
  <p>
   This Hindutva state, this Brahmanical society, put in iron chains the weak and exhausted muscles of the working masses. It keeps their belly half full with 5 kg of grain and constant frailty. Even after toil as slaves under the heat of summer or the bitter cold of winter, the oppressed masses of the country always remain victims of malnutrition.
  </p>
  <p>
   The social principles of the main form of Hindu nationalism (Hindutva) justify the colonization of India, praise the slavery of the Middle Ages and the slavery of antiquity. In addition, Hindutva defends the oppression of the mass workers and characterizes it as their inevitable fate. It continues the exploitation of work and the oppressed masses at a hard pace. It considers every democratic and secular position as a denial of its ideology. In fact, he considers them peaceful and that they do not fit men, and in their position supports the centralization of power, the submission to power and the violence for the terrorism of the opposition forces.
  </p>
  <p>
   What should we do to destroy the Hindu nation? The answer to this inevitable question is not as simple as breaking a glass castle. Without dwelling on the complexity of the issue/ without going into details of the answer, we must do what the Great Revolution of 1789 did to the French monarchy, what the Bolsheviks party did to the Russian Tsar and what the Freedom fighters in British colonialism.

  Many scholars depict Brahmanism either as a historical stage in the evolution of Hinduism or as a separate religious tradition. However, among the Hindus, especially within India, Brahmanism is generally regarded as part of their tradition rather than a separate religion.

   India or "Hindutva" is a term invented by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in 1923, and means the main form of Hindu nationalism in India. Bharatiya Janata (BJP) party adopted India as an official ideology in 1989. It is represented, along with the oldest ideology of the "Hindu Rashtra" by the voluntary nationalist organization, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Vishva Hindu Parishad. Many Indian social scientists have described the Hindutva movement as fascist.

   </span>
   The idea that the numerical majority of a population must have the last say in determination of decisions is called majority. The majority is a political philosophy or ideology that argues that a majority (sometimes categorized by religion, language, social class or some other determinant), has the right to primacy in society and the right to make decisions affecting society. Taking e.g. The ethnic dimension as a determinant provides the excuse for the ethnic majority groups to dominate minority groups without the need to secure equal rights and protection.

                       The secularism or secularism that Nehrou was inflicted on and supported by the first Prime Minister of Independent India from 1947 to 1964. India of Nehrou is supposed to be committed to "cosmicism". India's secularism does not completely separate religion and state. The idea here, in its weakest form, was that the government would not be involved in "personal" religious issues and create conditions in which people of all religions could live in harmony.

                         In April 1978, a 62 -year -old Muslim, Shah Bano, applied to the court seeking nutrition from her divorced husband Mohammed Ahmad Khan. The case is considered one of the legal milestones in the battle to protect the rights of Muslim women. While the country's Supreme Court supported the right to nutrition, the ruling triggered a political battle and a dispute over the extent to which the courts can intervene in Muslim personal law. The case put the ground for the Muslim Women's Struggle for equal rights to marriage and divorce in regular courts. 
 Later, in 1986, the Rajiv Gandhi government brought the law on Muslims mainly to annul the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling.
