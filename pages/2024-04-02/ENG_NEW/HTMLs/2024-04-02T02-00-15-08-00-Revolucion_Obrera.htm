    The main countries involved in the supply of weapons and military assets to Israel are the US, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. This document describes the sites connected to production for the Israeli army in different countries and, when possible, identify from where military goods are transported
   </strong>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Our goal is to provide an resource for actions that point to the production or transport of military goods, or that interrupt the activity of Israel's military suppliers, and also to link resources that can be used to take measures in specific countries.
  </p>
  <p>
   Our research identifies companies that produce some of the most fundamental armaments for the Israeli army, including Lockheed Martin (main contractor for the F35 combat plane), Boeing (manufacturer of many of the guided weapons used by the Israeli army), Bae Systems ( An important supplier for the F35), Leonardo (part of the F35 coalition) and Raytheon (manufacturer of the guided pump Paveway).
  </p>
  <p>
   The action is possible in different ways: while we identify direct production sites for the Israeli army, it is also possible to address multinational companies that produce for Israel even if military goods are manufactured elsewhere. Similarly, it is possible to point to companies involved in the transport of military goods to Israel.
  </p>
  <p>
   Weapons production is highly international and many of the most traceable supply chains are for goods such as combat aircraft manufactured by international coalitions. These planes are fundamental for the current war and the bombing of Gaza; Israel is using

   , including F15, F16, F35 and AH-64 Apache helicopters. There are 408 links in the supply chain for the F35, for example: see a

    Military and Logistics Transport from the United States to Israel
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Although many finished military products are transported by the Army itself, either on military vessels or by air transport, the components and some goods are transported by sea aboard normal ported ships. The ports are key nodes in the arms supply chain.
  </p>
  <p>
   The key actor in shipping from the United States, and other places in the world, towards Israel is the Zim ship line. Zim is the main shipping services provider to Israel and one of the ten largest shipping lines in the world. Previously controlled by the Israeli government, Zim has been privatized and quoted in the New York Stock Exchange during the last two decades. Despite this, it still maintains close links with the state of Israel and is crucial to guarantee logistics support for the State and IDF.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most military components enter and leave the United States through the ports of the East Coast, mainly New York / Newark, Savannah, Charleston and the port of Virginia. These ports are usually unionized by the International Stibators Association (ILA). This is because most military supply chains focus on Europe and the United States, with many components produced in Europe and the final assembly that takes place in the United States.
  </p>
  <p>
   With access to commercial data in the United States, it is possible to see individual shipments through their "boarding knowledge", the documents used by shipping lines to identify shipments and track delivery patterns. Rarely, this may include arms shipments in civil ships. For example, on March 4, 2023, a shipment of "war heads, rocket with explosive load" produced by Raytheon in Tucson, Arizona and valued at $ 100,000, left the port of Virginia to Haifa, Israel, on the ship Zim Yokohama Porternera. Other Raytheon shipments have left the same route in the following months. In most cases, commercial data can identify component routes. For example, Dunlop regularly sends tires for the F35 and other military aircraft from its factory in Birmingham, the United Kingdom, either through London to the port of Virginia or through Liverpool to Charleston.
