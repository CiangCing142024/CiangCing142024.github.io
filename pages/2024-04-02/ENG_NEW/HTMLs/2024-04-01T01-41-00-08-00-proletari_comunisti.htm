        Look at 
  The videos from Gaza is struck by ferocity 
 of the Israeli army; it is perceptible in every gesture, even 
 in free snorkels of children. There is no justice in it, 
 no ethical consciousness or justified action; There is only one 
 gigantic will to annihilate the Palestinians.
       </span>

     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        Ferocity, 
  cruelty, terror. Any term is used to describe the 
 behavior of the Israeli army, even the most precise, will not be 
 never able to fully represent what is happening 
 really in Gaza. Which is something exceptional; extraordinary, 
 own.

       <span>
        Becomes 
  increasingly clear that what is happening in that strip of 
 land is, together, a ferocity

       already seen, which re -tightened to others 
 genocidal drives, and a new type ferocity, which stands out for 
 the high technological capacity used against a people substantially 
 Unarmed. A painful and cowardly ferocity.

       <span>
        AND 
  It is clear that the end of the Israeli army is not “the destruction of 
 Hamas ”, but the removal of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, 
 First stop for a new colonization. It does not exist - it is possible, 
 Given the story of that conflict - no different objective.

        Self 
  It will not be a total departure, it will have to be balanced 
  - fragile - of that area of the world, rather than the ethical awakening of 
 Westerners or Arab countries. For the highly symbolic impact it has 
  Always had in the Arab populations, the "Palestinian question" is not 
 resolvable with a simple physical elimination of the Palestinians; 
 someone will have to stay alive, perhaps confined in some desert, 
 So that the balances are maintained at a guard level. Must 
 that the genocide is not complete so that Israel's goal will come 
 reached up.

        So, 
  no; However positively the resolution of the 
 UN security advice, there is nothing to applaud. Fire 
 It will always cease too late.

        TO 
  Gaza is not only shipwrecked the ethics of Western countries, now 
 clearly deprived of his intrinsic "humanistic and liberating sense", 
  But the inability of the liberal-democracies to stop a 
 genocide in progress. All the superstitions deriving from the excess of 
 confidence with the Israeli "democracy", from the propensity to 
 tolerate their excesses and crimes, delivered the Palestinians 
 to the massacre.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        In 
  last two years we got drunk with rhetoric, demonizing the 
 autocracies and glorifying the liberal-democratic system; But it 
 painful show offered by the West in the face of the genocide of 
 Palestinians shows - once again and unequivocally - that this 
 which count are not the "values", the "universal" rights or the law 
 international, but only and only the strategic alliances.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        The 
  "Spirit" profound liberal-democracies is not very different from 
 that of autocrazies: You make history when you do business. From 
 consequence, any positioning different from the one that brings a 
 Strategic advantage is nefarious and must be carefully avoided. Until 
  When Israel will help to defend the western ambitions of 
 hegemony, until it is worthy of this role in the chessboard 
 medium-eastern, will not discredit its value.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>

     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        Not 
  It is certain that the greatest mystification has revealed itself 
 In the most squalid representatives of militarized liberalism, i 
 fanatics of atlantism who did not hesitate to accuse of 
 Anti -Semitism anyone who has criticized Israel. Those who, for 
 understand us, do not fail to support the Ukrainian flag with that of 
 Israel, regardless of the logical short circuit and of every decency 
 intellectual.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        These 
  liberals from operetta are the avant -garde cialtrona dell'Egemonia 
 western; they place themselves beyond any truly universal value, 
 Perishing the cause of a hateful form of supremacy. The defense of 
 Israel is part of this ideological cage. They have eluded their own 
 rhetoric, combining cynical and instinct for conservation of 
 an hegemony that is already lost; mystification and sense of superiority: the 
 Worse, really.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        These 
  they are only the most grotesque representation of a "spirit" that is 
 constitutive of liberal-democracies, whose vital interests do not 
 They coincide with those of the peoples, but with class exclusivity. 
 The adjective "liberal" dominates the noun "democracy".
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        The essence, 
  Here you are; of democracy. There is the democracy of the privilege, and there is that 
 of equity. In the first, what has the most value is the market, the 
 profit, business, all dimensions that produce inequalities and 
 poverty; In the second, the overcoming of iniquities is the fulcrum of 
 Every action, its only purpose.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        There 
  First, that of privileges is the democracy of the stock exchange, of 
 colonialism, the accentralization of wealth in a few hands, of 
 combination of politics and military industry; The second is democracy 
 of the "without properties", of peoples, of peace.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        For 
  The first, the theft of resources serves to maintain privileges; and the 
  democracy that wants to export herself, not hesitating to bomb 
 other nations, invading lands not of his, violating the law 
 international. For the second, only the equality of peoples has value 
 positive, any part of the land inhabits.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        There is 
  The democracy of imperial interests, and there is that of peoples. If the 
  first makes the world a less free and safe place, the second has 
 a single reason to exist: get rid of the forces that promote the 
 first, making democracy the space of equality e 
 of peace.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        In 
  fund, even in the "Palestinian question" a different idea is at stake 
 of democracy. The idea of a democracy that cannot coincide with the 
 colonialism, military occupation or ethnic cleaning. Just for 
 This, today, democracy defends itself by contrasting the attitude 
 Genocidaria of Israel.
       </span>
      </span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
     <span>
      <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
       <span>
        Everything is fine 
  speech that defends the instances of Israel and that justifies them to 
 behaviors is not only complicity with the genocide, but it is also - e 
 perhaps above all - a way of emptying the very idea of 
 democracy.
