 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Committee 
 Central of the Communist Party of the Philippines holds the flag high 
 red of the national democratic revolution and, on behalf of all 
 Paintings and party members, revolutionaries and activists, addresses the 
 his more firm greeting to all the red commanders, to the fighters and 
 to the militias, while we celebrate, on this very important occasion 
 and Gioiosa, the 55th anniversary of the new army of the people.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today, we look at 
 back to our successes and shortcomings during the year 
 past, we draw lessons from these and formulate plans to obtain 
 bigger results in conducting the revolutionary armed struggle 
 against the fascist regime and the Marcos-Strati united in the next 
 year.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this 
 occasion, we remember and honor all the heroes and martyrs of the 
 Filipino Revolution that sacrificed everything for the cause of 
 Filipino people for national and social liberation. We exalt the 
 their life and let us inspire their martyrdom. What way 
 Better to honor their memory than by continuing the cause 
 revolutionary who have helped to advance?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Committee
Centrale is pleased to inform everyone that the call for a movement
that the Party launched last December was
wholeheartedly welcomed by all the regional committees of the Party
and the NEP commands. They have responded positively and are
currently holding synthesis conferences and study meetings for
identify errors and deficiencies in order to correct them, and
carry out all tasks consistently and comprehensively
Revolutionary.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We must do 
 everything possible to carry on the revolution, in order to 
 defend the interests of the Philippines who are subjected to 
 increasingly serious forms of oppression and exploitation by the 
 US-MARCOS regime. The country faces the real and growing danger of 
 be dragged into an inter-imperialist war. The necessity of 
 carry on the revolutionary armed struggle, in particular, is of 
 great urgency, being the most important weapon of the Filipino people 
 to fight for his revolutionary cause.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The conditions of 
 Crisis of the country push the oppressed and exploited masses of the people 
 Filippino to carry on their struggles. Under the guidance of the party, 
 The revolutionary forces are determined to awaken, organize and 
 mobilize the Filipino people in large numbers, carry on 
 constantly the national democratic revolution and bring it to 
 unprecedented levels in the future, facing all sacrifices e 
 The necessary difficulties.

  The Armed Struggle
led by the New People's Army (NPA) under the
absolute leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines is in a moment
critic. The cadres of the party, the commanders and the red fighters, the
Revolutionary Mass Organizations and Activists in the Countryside
and in the cities, they are called to courageously take on our
urgent tasks, to raise the red flag of the
revolution, to inflame the armed struggle, to lift it from its
current state of adversity and to emerge stronger than ever.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <br/>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the one hand, there is 
 the urgent need to lead the armed struggle to launch shots 
 against the enemy in the face of the intensification of the aggression 
 imperialist economic and military intervention e 
 to the intensification of the fascist assault. The declared goal of 
 enemy of "putting an end to the reinforced conflict" Try to 
 pave the way to the absolute trampling of the sovereignty of the 
 country and to the total oppression of the Filipino people.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand, the 
 our forces have been weakened to a large extent by internal errors, 
 weaknesses and deficiencies due to years of military conservatism e 
 passivity. Guided by the party, the NEP units are currently 
 undertaking crucial rectification and consolidation efforts with 
 the aim of overcoming the arrest trips of the past, exit 
 from military liability, preserving and expanding their forces e 
 reinvigorate the guerrilla warfare.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  To cope with 
 this particular situation, we must firmly grasp the 
 dialectical relationship between fighting the enemy and strengthening ours 
 Forces: we must strengthen the NEP to effectively fight the 
 enemy; We must fight the enemy to effectively strengthen the 
 Nep. We cannot separate from each other. The first is enough 
 clear to see and does not need to be developed further; 
 But the latter is not so obvious, and some could also 
 Support the opposite.
 </p>
 <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   When we talk 
 of armed struggle and fight against the enemy, we intend to hit the 
 enemy armed forces, using all kinds of weapons in the hands of the 
 guerrilla and the people. We intend mainly to organize 
 basic tactics offensive that we are able to win, that 
 they weaken the enemy by annihilating his armed forces piece for 
 piece, and they take off their weapons so that they can arm more recruits e 
 Organize even larger tactics offensive in the future. 
 We increase the ability of the NEP to make war making war.
  </p>
  <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
   <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    In front of 
 to the current assault of the enemy, the NEP commands at the front level 
 and provincial or sub -shade, they must plan to lead one 
 active defense war at the level of campaigns and battles, anticipate 
 the deployment of the enemy and hitting its weakest parts. 
 They must be ready to move their main forces or the center 
 of gravity outside the lighter of the enemy, leaving or 
 By sending teams or composite units to conduct various types of actions 
 of guerrillas and tactical offensives who are able to win e 
 inflict serious damage to the enemy.
   </p>
   <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     The task of 
 organize tactical offensive that we are able to win must 
 be completed with meticulous planning and with the 
 maximum vigor, as a way to galvanize the NEP and as the first 
 decisive step for the correction.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Along the line
to wage extensive and intense guerrilla warfare on a mass basis
wider and deeper, all the units of the People's Army
and popular militias are called upon to take full initiative
and to exercise flexibility in their actions.
The NEP must strengthen and expand its ties with the masses. Must
to defend the peasant masses and the people against their oppressors and
fascist exploiters, and make propaganda, organization and
mobilization to carry on their anti-feudal mass struggles and
agrarian reform.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Most 
 of NEP plants must be deployed to help consolidate 
 and expand the guerrilla fronts and build guerrilla fronts 
 larger like companies. Guerrilla platoons must 
 forge a clear floor to send their units within one data 
 ray that is limited at a given moment to avoid excessive 
 dispersion, but wide enough for defensive and offensive maneuvers, 
 with a clear period of time to advance wave on, or 
 expand the revolutionary mass base on the basis of 
 Consolidation. We expand the area of NEP operations with methods of 
 delay advancement or secretly bypassing in relatively areas 
 favorable where it can start lifting, organizing and mobilizing 
 people to get a support point. We can always send 
 NEP unit in pioneering missions to start guerrilla war 
 Open new areas of guerrilla warfare where the less suspicious enemy and yes 
 Wait.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     Together with 
 Farmer mass organizations, to the territorial committees of 
 party and other revolutionary forces, the NEP must lead 
 social investigation campaigns to identify issues and i 
 more urgent problems than the masses and accelerating the efforts for 
 lift, organize and mobilize the peasant masses, bringing 
 forward their urgent democratic claims, connecting them with 
 their agricultural revolutionary movement and the democratic revolution 
 popular.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     We need to lend
Attention to the construction or reconstruction of the organs of the
political power in the villages and at the highest levels on the foundations
of the full-fledged mass organizations of peasants, women,
young people, cultural workers and other workers who cover the
neighborhoods or groups of neighborhoods or municipalities, as well as sections
and the party's sectional committees. Many of these organs
of political power have been targeted by armed repression
of the enemy. We need to summarize our experiences and find
policies to ensure that the organs of political power, the
mass organizations, local mass leaders are protected and
kept off the radar of enemy intelligence.
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
     We have to 
 consolidate and strengthen the base of the masses and forge plans for 
 increase their militancy to affirm their civil rights, 
 political, social and economic, and to unmask and resist 
 collectively and resolutely to the dirty tactics of the enemy. 
 We have to frustrate the despicable plans of the enemy aimed at breaking 
 the unity of the people, force him to surrender one by one, or 
 ENLUS THE COMMANDERS AND THE RED FUNTURES to abandon the masses 
 with false promises of a better future. In fighting the campaign 
 of repression of the enemy, local forces must not be 
 abandon themselves to themselves. Their struggle must be brought to a 
 higher level to draw strength from numbers and solidarity 
 of people, from villages adjacent to the international community. 
 Above all, the NEP must make all the efforts to demonstrate his 
 determination to defend the people by hitting their oppressors 
 fascists.

       Wherever they go, the
Red fighters and NEP commanders also carry out campaigns of
production, education, health and culture in order to address the
practical needs of the masses. They must continue to forge bonds
strong and inseparable from the masses. They must always identify with the
the ills of the peasant masses and find solutions to the situation facing them.

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The units of the NEP 
 they must consolidate, strengthen and expand their own strength. AND 
 extremely important that the fighters and red commanders are 
 They unite with a single mind and act as a single body. For 
 achieve this, they must take stock of their points of 
 strength and weakness and plan the necessary measures to increase 
 The determination and ability of red fighters and masses 
 revolutionary to fight and frustrate the attacks on the whole field 
 of the enemy.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       We have to 
 improve the NEP command structure at all levels, 
 ensuring the quality and composition of the units controls 
 of the horizontal and vertical forces, as well as the command of 
 regional and provincial or sub -shared territorial operations. The 
 Manager nucleus at every level of command of the NEP should be 
 composed of commanders and fighters who are models of courage of 
 in front of the enemy and models of humility in the face of the masses.

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The units of the NEP 
 they should continue to master flexibility in changing 
 their ways of action from concentration, dispersion e 
 to the move, depending on the situation and their goals. 
 We concentrate our forces to attack the enemy and consolidate ourselves, 
 disperse us to conduct mass works, disappear in front of the 
 enemy and create more initiative points, and we move to 
 pursue expansion plans or to get out of lighter 
 enemy.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       All units 
 of the NEP must avoid unrelated battles and look for ways for 
 Make the enemy punch the air and run out. They have to 
 immediately and regularly evaluate their situation, correct 
 All security bellies and remove all vulnerabilities. 
 They must diligently look at the enemy tactic of 
 smuggling electronic or GPS locators. They must strengthen the 
 their determination to put into practice the principles and methods of the 
 secrecy in guerrilla movements, during the march or the 
 bivouac. They must constantly maintain a high level of discipline 
 and respect for military regulations between the red fighters, and a 
 high degree of revolutionary political consciousness to strengthen the 
 their will to make the sacrifices necessary to maintain the 
 NEP security. They must criticize and correction all 
 violations of policies and security regulations that 
 compromise the secrecy of the guerrilla warfare.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The NEP must 
 decisively dismantle the enemy intelligence network that yes 
 hides in plain sight among the masses, narrowing the field to 
 Capibanda, in particular to those who have committed serious crimes 
 against the people. The masses, especially those who have endured 
 The weight of the repression campaign of the enemy demand that the 
 Subscribed traitors who actively collaborated with the enemy 
 as agents or spies, they are subjected to revolutionary punishments and that 
 their misdeed criminals and counter -revolutionaries are completely 
 unmasked.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       All units 
 of the NPA must evaluate the intelligence of the enemy of the enemy 
 (built from information contained in compromised files, 
 disclosed by traitors or accumulated through long periods of 
 surveillance) and how this is connected to the conduct of 
 enemy operations. Must make appropriate plans and adjustments in the 
 their plans to make the intelligence information of the enemy not 
 practicable or unusable.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The NPA must 
 continue to follow rigorous rules in safety and in 
 protection of sensitive information, observing the 
 compartmentalization, using figures and encryption and lending 
 attention to permanent policies that cover the regulated use 
 computers, smartphones, cell phones, radio transceiver e 
 Other electronic gadgets. We must also develop mastery 
 of the art of disinformation and sidetracking, including 
 the power supply of the intelligence network of the enemy or of the 
 electronic surveillance with false positives, in order to confuse the 
 enemy and frustrate his attacks.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       We need to lead
a campaign of proselytism in the ranks of the enemy, many of whom
are of peasant, working-class, semi-proletarian or
petty-bourgeois, who were enticed to enlist in the
armies of the enemy because of his high wages. I am fully
aware of the rot and corruption of the organization
reactionary military forces, and have deep grievances about the abuses
perpetrated against them by their superiors, as well as for the serious
crimes and human rights violations that they are forced to
perpetrate against the masses. We have to hand out leaflets and do

      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       We have to 
 Continue to build and strengthen the party within the new 
 Popular army to guide him in all his duties. We have to 
 continue to recruit the most advanced elements and guarantee theirs 
 training and their ideological, political and organizational development. THE 
 Party committees must be built at the level of companies; 
 Sections of the party in platforms; and party groups in teams. The 
 Party must designate political officials among its ran ranks and 
 instructors in each NEP formation to ensure that politics 
 commands weapons. We must also guarantee the deployment of paintings 
 and activists of urban areas, in particular of the files of 
 workers, as well as students, teachers and other intellectuals 
 and small-bourgeois professionals, in order to increase the ability 
 of the NEP in carrying out the various management tasks e 
 administration.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The tasks above
are critical and must be carried out with a high degree of
urgency from Party cadres and red commanders in the centre and
to the leadership of the New People's Army. It is particularly
urgent need to take the military and political initiative to regain the
guerrilla warfare points of the NPA units, especially those
have suffered setbacks in the past and forced into a
passive position, frustrate the enemy's assault and carry on the
Revolutionary armed struggle. These tasks are to be carried out by the
Left and from the NEP as we carry on the rectification movement
to eradicate the ideological foundations of the errors and weaknesses of the
in order to create the conditions for renewed growth
of the revolutionary armed struggle.

      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       Each unit of the

 from the global self -criticism provided in the Committee's message

 experiences in the context of their work and the circumstances of theirs 
 areas of activity. The units that have undergone setbacks 
 must pay particular attention to the analysis of the battles

 We have to learn from the lessons paid at a high price with the blood 
 of our martyrs as a way to honor their sacrifices.

      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The 55th 
 Anniversary of the NPA is a very propitious opportunity to reaffirm 
 The basic principles and the theory of popular war in the Philippines. 
 This is particularly important as we are faced with 
 a critical situation following serious setbacks in the 
 last years, which require us to correct our mistakes and 
 our weaknesses.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       Applying the 
 Marxism-Leninism-Maoism at the concrete conditions of the country, the 
 Party has developed the theory of popular war in the Philippines 
 and led the new army of the people in conducting the armed struggle 
 revolutionary from one level to another. The 1974 article, 
 Specific characteristics of our popular war, exposed the 
 theory, the principles, the program and the plan to conduct a war 
 revolutionary in the Philippines. Took the system into consideration 
 semi -colonial and semi -feudal, the archipelagic character of his 
 geographical and physical soil, as well as other specific characteristics 
 of the country.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       Our 
 conquests in revolutionary practice in the last 55 years are the 
 concrete proof of the correctness of these theories. A further test 
 of the validity of these theories are the setbacks and the 
 losses we have suffered because of our inability to 
 Firmly stick to these theories.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       The rightness 
 of the National Democratic Revolution was demonstrated in the 
 practice leading the revolutionary armed struggle in the countryside such as 
 main form of struggle, and the mass revolutionary movement that 
 combines legal and illegal forms of struggle in cities and in the 
 campaigns, as a secondary but indispensable form of struggle. 
 Supporting the national democratic line, we managed to build 
 a mass base of several million people, under the firm 
 direction of the proletariat, creating the basic alliance of 
 workers and peasants mainly through the management of the NEP 
 by the party, and building the national front for 
 fight imperialism, feudalism and capitalism

 dominant of the great bourgeois compradores and the great owners

      <p p="" style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
       <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
        In the last 55
years, we have overcome the greatest difficulties and obstacles in the
to wage the people's war in the Philippines as an archipelagic country.
We were able to develop guerrilla warfare on a scale of our own.
despite the disadvantage of not having a physical backline.
We have established guerrilla fronts and consolidated rural bases with
strong enough units of the NEP in all the main islands of the
country. These guerrilla fronts served as theaters for the
units of the NPA to conduct guerrilla warfare. They create zones and bases of
guerrilla warfare first in less populated mountainous terrain, where they could
consolidate, train, and plan for expansion to the plains
rivers, major transport lines and areas
Coastal.
       </p>
       <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
        Starting alone 
 60 red fighters armed with only nine automatic rifles and 26 weapons 
 lower type of fire in the second district of the province of 
 Tarlac, we managed to develop our forces from teams and 
 Plotoni, to the guerrilla forces of the force force. We have 
 created 14 regional commands of the NEP, each of which has reached 
 a maximum strength of a few hundred or more or less a thousand fighters 
 Rossi, and each one has a number of sub -supremes or 
 provincials with different fronts of guerrilla warfare.

        The revolution 
 National Democratic Filipino had the particularity of being 
 progressed in great steps and having led the armed struggle 
 in the current period of international backwarding of the proletariat 
 world. With the defeat of the socialist revolution and the 
 capitalist restoration in China and in the Soviet Union under the 
 modern revisionist regime, the Filipino people had to lead and 
 independently develop the revolutionary armed struggle.

        Like the party

        In the 80s,

 They questioned the basic analysis of the system party

         Next to the
"left" opportunists, there were various strands of
right-wing opportunists who rejected the need to conduct a
Revolutionary armed struggle. In the late 1980s, some
promoted the line of "people's democracy" that in the end
has been consolidated into "non-governmental organisations" that
They promote reformism and class collaboration. To them, yes
They will later unite the "left" opportunists who,
after having failed in their line of insurrectionalism and
military adventurism, they served as NGO bureaucrats in the
so-called "civil society" community. Still others
engaged in "peace talks" to facilitate the
their surrender to the reactionary regime, with some allowed to maintain
paramilitary forces to fight the NEP, while engaging in
various types of criminal activity.

         There he wanted the 
 Second great correction movement to save the forces of the 
 Revolutionary guerrillas from suffering further serious losses. 
 Reaffirming the fundamental principles of the party to conduct the 
 popular democratic revolution through a popular war 
 prolonged, the NEP units were reorganized to reach a 
 correct balance of horizontal and vertical forces, in order to 
 carry out both political and military work effectively. The 
 Party stated the tactical military line to lead a guerrilla warfare 
 extended and intensive on the basis of an increasingly broad mass base 
 and deep in the strategic defense phase.

         Even then, 
 However, we were bogged down in military conservatism problems 
 who kept things stopped at the intermediate phase. Years of 
 conservatism in all aspects of revolutionary work and 
 complacency have led to the self -usement of the army 
 popular and a slow weakening and reduction of the mass base, 
 making it vulnerable to lighter and enemy repression, 
 leading to setbacks and losses. One of the harmful effects 
 of empiricism was our inability to draw quickly 
 lessons from experience in order to raise the level of ours 
 knowledge and theory, from the level of the national command of the NEP up 
 to the regions and fronts, with the result of not adapting to 
 changes in the enemy's tactics and to make mistakes

         Under the

 Central Committee issued it on December 26, 2023. Sessions 
 of summary and study, conferences of social investigation and meetings

 Party was on the verge of capitulation following capture e 
 to the assassination of some key leaders of the party, as well as to 
 disappearance of Ka Joma, the president of the party and his 
 Guide light. In response, the enemy has paid any quantity again 
 greater than funds and resources in his counter -revolutionary war e 
 has further intensified his encirclement campaign e 
 repression. This has now taken the form of incessant and widespread 
 armed repression campaigns against peasant communities, 
 Air and artillery bombing and combat operations on 
 Large scale in dozens of guerrilla fronts throughout the country.

          Inspired by 
 Rectification movement, party leaders and NEP fighters 
 have become more fearless and determined, despite the great 
 disparity in the current balance of forces. We can recognize 
 more deeply than the superiority of the enemy in terms of 
 armaments provided by the United States is compensated by rot e 
 from the dying state of the system that is defending; is that 
 The inferiority of the NEP in terms of armaments is compensated by the 
 his superiority in terms of broad support of the Philippine masses. 
 Armed with the dialectical method of thought, we also recognize that 
 This situation is temporary and in the end it will pass through the 
 his denial, as the popular war advances from its phase 
 current to the next one and the enemy is further involved 
 in the unsolvable crisis of imperialism and the system 
 Semi -colonial and semi -feudal dominant.
