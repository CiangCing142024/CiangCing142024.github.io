    Protest against the Anti-Muslim and Hindutva fascist’s Citizenship Amendment Act!

 </p>
 <p>
  Ignoring the people’s protest all over the country Brahmanic Hindutva Fascist BJP’s government at the
center under the leadership of Narendra Modi has implemented anti-people, especially anti-Muslim Citizenship
Amendment Act (CAA) through an ordinance. The Central Committe of CPI (Maoist) strongly condemns this decision
of the BJP government and appeals to all progressive-democratic intellectuals, students, youth, pro-people
journalists, human rights organizations, peasants, workers and Muslims to build militant protest for the abrogation
of CAA.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of tabling the CAA in the Parliament, Modi government’s act of implementing CAA through
ordinance is nothing but a conspiracy. Modi government has taken such wrong method to rescue itself from deep
discussions on the CAA and mass protest against it. Just one day before the holy month of Ramadan CAA was
implemented and on the day of Ramadan, Modi expressed well-wishes to Muslims was nothing but making fun of
them. One has to note one more point that in the BJP ruled state of Uttarakhand, on that very day anti-people
Uniform Civil Code (UCC) was passed by the State Assembly for implementation. All these depict the anti-Muslim
policies of the BJP-RSS and its hatred towards the Muslim community.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact CAA is influenced from Hindu religion and is totally antagonistic towards Muslim. To deny citizenship
of a community of a particular religion and to terminate their citizenship is what the inhuman CAA law is designed
for. To cover up this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is propagating that CAA is related to giving citizenship to
religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan. This apart, CAA will forcefully deport 40 thousand
persecuted Rohingya Muslims that turns their life in danger. This law was made and is now being implemented in
violation of the Indian Constitution which talks about secularism. Indian fascist rulers are ignoring the present Indian
Constitution. Remember that RSS-BJP has brought CAA to fulfil its agenda of Hindu-Rashtr. Modi’s developed “New
India” is in reality Hindutva fascist India which is against the exploited and oppressed classes and especially against
particular social communities, the Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists. It is also a den for corporate plunder of the
country’s resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today RSS-BJP and its affiliated organizations have become a threat to the nation and people. Our Central
Committe appeals to the people of the country, democratic-progressive forces, patriotic people, human rights
organizations, Adivasi and Non-Adivasi organizations, people from religious minorities especially, Muslims, Sikhs,
Christians, Buddhists and people of nationalities of Kashmir and Northeastern regions to gird up for protest and
march forward against the Brahmanical Hindutva fascism.
