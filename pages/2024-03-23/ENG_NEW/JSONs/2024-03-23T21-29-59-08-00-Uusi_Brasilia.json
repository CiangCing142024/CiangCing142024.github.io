The invitation reached the entire local population in flying markets and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts to clean and isolated water sources, 50 meters from the livestock farmer and eucalyptus plantations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240317-WA0036.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240317-WA0036.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240317-WA0035.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240317-WA0035.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240317-WA0027-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240317-WA0027-1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0066.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0066.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0069.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0069.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0078.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0078.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0081.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0081.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0088.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0088.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\">\n  <div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n   <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0089.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0089.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n  </div>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  To do all this work, the status advocates dropped Jos\u00e9 Ricardo's revolutionary area of peasants and young students in the Mangue Vermelho movement. They helped to clear the bushes and mark fences to protect water sources in the scorching sun. More, they met alongside the rest of the people, fighting the provocations of the gentlemen.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0076.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0076.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0086-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/640x480_IMG-20240319-WA0086-1.jpg\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  As soon as the peasants had completed their joint effort with the first water source of the day, singing folk songs and shouting slogans, half -time rifle from large farms appeared with tractors, stage farms, motorcycles and quads. The gunmen arrived with the posts, thread and eucalyptus seeds to put them in the same area that the peasants had just cleared. When the peasant march faced bands, representatives of the farmland began to threaten the peasants with firearms. The voltage led to a confrontation, three guns were injured, and the droon of the big farm was destroyed by the furious folk of firearms.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This same March 18: A MPPE agricultural promoter, CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee to monitor agrarian conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the pasture commission (CPT) and Pernambuco workers and peasant federation (Fetape) perhaps A large farming company Agropecu\u00e1ria from Mata Sul S/A visited to study complaints of the peasants made by the farm. According to this information, this Commission did not visit the water sources of the peasants, but only to the places shown in the farm.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, the powerful action of the peasants forced the entire Commission to introduce the act at the scene of the Aktio and to approve two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Folk Alliance (Abrapo) and the Commission of the Barro Branco Farm Association, and also had to accept the urgent conditions of the people in the public.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the end, the MPPE accepted the proposal of the peasants represented by Abrapo to create a \"water corridor\" to separate the people's water sources. The landlord was ordered to pay for the posts and wire, the city administration sent the workers, and the State Environment Department became responsible for examining the people's waters to determine pollution and open a criminal investigation against the landlord.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After hearing the court, Guilherme Maranh\u00e3o's gunmen asked for reinforcements from the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to plant eucalyptus to one of the water sources, which had been cleaned up by the peasants, and the farm lawyer Eduardo Figueredo proclaimed that they would complete the milestone.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Two vehicles were sent to bring security to the gunmen to continue their anti -folk action. This is not a courage to show, but rather a cowardice in front of a small display of peasants connected and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how dedicated the military forces of this old state are about protecting the interests of the state of space and promoting the poverty of the poor in the country and in the city.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The peasants occupying the former Frei Caneca status are determined to take back all their water sources and their land from the hands of the farm. In this way, they invite all peasants in the southern forest area of the Pernambuco to rise against the rifle groups of large farms and the armed forces of this old state. Without destruction, large farms can never be entitled to the poor of the rural rural.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Translated from the And's news:\n  <a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-camponeses-retomam-fontes-dagua-do-latifundio-apos-derrotar-pistoleiros-em-confronto/\">\n   https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-camponeses-retomam-fontes-dagua-do-latifundio-apos-derrotar-pistoleiros-em-confronto/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://uusibrasilia.wordpress.com/2024/03/23/talonpojat-ottivat-vesilahteet-takaisin-suurtilalta-lyotyaan-pyssymiehet-yhteenotossa/", "type": "article", "title": "The peasants took the water sources back from a large farm after hitting the gunmen in a clash", "description": "Approximately 100 farmers organized by the Poor Peasant Association Jaqueira (Pernambuco) from various communities took back their water source, which had been fenced by a large farmer company. 18.\u2026", "modified time": "2024-03-23T13:29:59+00:00", "author": ["uusibrasilia"], "categories": ["Uncategorized"], "source_name": "Uusi Brasilia"}
