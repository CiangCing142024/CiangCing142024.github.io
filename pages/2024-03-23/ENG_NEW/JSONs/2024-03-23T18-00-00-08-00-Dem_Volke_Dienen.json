The Hamburg Palestine alliance invited to the event.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It started with a cultural contribution in which activists of the Red Federation sang the song \"The Women of the Community\". Then they explained the backgrounds of March 18 as the anniversary of the Paris community. The new interview with Professor Saibaba, which was recently released, was announced.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was also reported by Young Struggle on the situation of political prisoners in Turkey and Kurdistan, the torture methods in the knots, prison types and explained how the prison system was expanded to accommodate the revolutionary capture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <img alt=\"Hamburg Veranstaltung 18 M\u00e4rz 2\" src=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/HH/2024/Hamburg_-_Veranstaltung_18_M\u00e4rz_-2.png\" srcset=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/images/HH/2024/Hamburg_-_Veranstaltung_18_M\u00e4rz_-2.png\"/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Representatives of the prisoner information also reported on the background of Daniela Klette's arrest, which is accused of how she is humiliated and reported by the customer's stimulation on Sunday, March 10th in Vechta, where solidarity was shown. The register of the rally, a member of the works council in the hospital in Bremen, has now even been banned from the house in the clinic in which she works. The repression against this person has meanwhile assumed so absurd features that professional bans are again in the room, only for political ideas that you have - i.e. basically a judicial justice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the discussion, once again, in the times when the masses in the world - especially in Palestine - fight and are also on the move in the FRG, important topics are set on the agenda. In this way, the discussion quickly came to important basic questions of revolutionary work and, above all, whether the revolutionaries should continue to wait to show the masses the right way to exemption, about whether they have to show in practice how this struggle is to be carried out. In short: whether missionaries are needed or an actual revolutionary vanguard.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/t-brd/8394-hamburg-veranstaltung-anlaesslich-des-18-maerz", "keywords": ["Internetplattform", "revolution\u00e4re Bewegung", "Dem Volke Dienen", "Nachrichten", "Theorie"], "author": "rine", "description": "Internet platform for the development of a revolutionary movement", "title": "Hamburg: event on the occasion of March 18", "tags": ["Hamburg", "Veranstaltung", "18.
