In total at least 31,726 people have been killed by the state of Israel since the beginning of the current genocidal campaign.

Even UN agents, dominated by Yankee imperialism, say\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1770068341551452168\">\n   implicitly\n  </a>\n  that the state of Israel are using starvation as a weapon of war.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b25d60692723c5acf97a3cc9e0b002a6\">\n  War laws, how often the imperialists regularly deny unless they serve their interests, are clearly defined and are well known to all soldiers of any army. The ruptures of these laws are considered war crimes.\n  <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/es/doc/resources/documents/treaty/treaty-gc-4-5tdkyk.htm\">\n   Article 55\n  </a>\n  of the fourth convention of Geneva clearly declares that the state of Israel is responsible for the needs of the people under their occupation:\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-325fb4ad8e1e3783f219ec00eff58b9e\">\n  \u201c\n  <em>\n   To the entire measure of its resources, the occupant power has the duty to supply the population in food and medical products; Especially you must import food, medicines and any other necessary article when the resources of the occupied territory are insufficient. \u201d\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1b8957417381caed71362d68c1ed7cc7\">\n  The facts on the situation in Gaza, clearly show that the state of Israel is committing a war crime breaking this law.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-24ebad4b1b808d34ca6ffb0520f03bb5\">\n  On January 26, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) made a\n  <a href=\"https://icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20240126-ord-01-00-en.pdf\">\n   preliminary statement,\n  </a>\n  that said the following:\n  <em>\n   \u201cThe State of Israel must, according to its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, in relation to the Palestinians in Gaza, take all the measures in their hand to avoid the commission of all acts of face to what was said in article II of this convention. \"\n  </em>\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5e1779868c14d3b675a18bcad80c440e\">\n  British Oxfam NGO has\n  <a href=\"https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/israel-government-continues-block-aid-response-despite-icj-genocide-court-ruling\">\n   denunciated\n  </a>\n  This despite the fact that ICJ's criteria is that Israel continues to block Gaza deliberately. Among the various methods, the state of Israel does so as follows: blocking help by creating bottlenecks only allowing help through two crosses; imposing a bureaucratic inspection system which delays trucks, on average for 20 days; and rejecting the necessary supplies such as fuel, generators, protective material and communications equipment, stating that this can only be used for military purposes.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b339d147e4593f1a5603bb38acb049be\">\n  But not only neglecting to provide the employed population with the necessary supplies, also blocking other parts of doing so, the state of Israel is also eating a war crime breaching article 23 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva. This article requires states that \"the free step of all shipping of medicines and health material\" for civilians and \"will also allow the free step of any shipment of indispensable food, clothes and tonic reserved for children of less than fifteen years and for women or parturients. \"\n  <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/es/document/protocolo-i-adicional-convenios-ginebra-1949-proteccion-victimas-conflictos-armados-internacionales-1977\">\n   Paragraph 2 of article 70\n  </a>\n  of the additional protocol for conventions expands this obligation:\n  <em>\n   \"2.

It is prohibited, as a war method, to make civilians suffer hungry. \u201d\n  </em>\n  Subsequently in paragraph 2 of the same article, establishes that:\n  <em>\n   \"2. It is prohibited to attack, destroy, subtract or use the indispensable assets for the survival of the civilian population, such as food items and agricultural areas that produce them, crops, livestock, facilities and reserves of drinking water and the works of Irrigation, with the deliberate intention of depriving of these assets, for their value as means to ensure subsistence, civil population or adverse part, whatever reason, either to make civilians suffer hungry, to provoke your displacement, or with any other purpose. \"\n  </em>\n  It has been\n  <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker\">\n   informed\n  </a>\n  that in Gaza 83% of the wells are not operational.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-981f53e996a2b937ace9f652ff464d3b\">\n  While they ignore the obvious war crimes committed by the state of Israel, the imperialists, acting as if it were a natural disaster, try to give the impression that they want to help the people of Gaza with insufficient measures such as air throws of material. When these\n  <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/2/28/palestinians-rush-into-the-sea-as-aircraft-drop-aid-into-gaza\">\n   They do not fall into the sea\n  </a>\n  o\n  <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/2/28/palestinians-rush-into-the-sea-as-aircraft-drop-aid-into-gaza\">\n   People kill\n  </a>\n  After failing the parachutes, they are still a drop in the ocean for the Palestinian hungry. German imperialism has deployed two transport aircraft to launch help on Gaza, however these aircraft can only transport 18 tons each. This is less than the capacity of a truck, which usually has about 20 tons. While the population of Gaza needs around 500 help trucks every day, they have only entered Gaza 2,874 trucks in February, less than 100 per day. The current trend is that this amount of help is decreasing.\n </p>\n</article>\n", "source": "https://nuevademocracia.com.co/?p=26149", "title": "Gaza: The famine is imminent", "author": "Nueva Democracia", "categories": ["_", "IMPERIALISMO", "INTERNACIONAL"], "source_name": "Nueva Democracia"}
