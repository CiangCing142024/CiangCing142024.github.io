It plans to impose financial and criminal responsibility on students who are involved in occupations and their parents!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The aim of the ministry is to terrorize parents and students and to suppress the student struggles. This move is the continuation of a series of terrorism and repression measures that have implemented in the past, such as police raids in schools, telecommunications and continuous terrorism from the addresses for the potential consequences after an occupation, abstinence, or abstinence, or abstinence, or abstinence Any other act is opposed to the climate of discipline the ministry wants. Measures that implemented directly to break squats, and sometimes it didn't even take it since only the threat of their implementation was sufficient.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   They make the penalties stricter in the penalties and tighten the absences by restoring the 50 unjustified and 50 justified, in order to terrorize students for the penalties that will wait for them! So all these terrorism measures the ministry passes because it is afraid of student struggles! And he is scared because he knows what they can do!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   So we must not let any of the new measures pass. We have to fight and overthrow them. Neither a national diploma, nor private universities, nor penalties! We have to organize with assemblies, squats! With our struggles we can overturn all the measures that are aimed at terrorizing us, but overall and overthrow the black future they are preparing!\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n   <li>\n    <b>\n     DOWN THE HANDS FROM THEIR STUDENTS AND THEIR GAMES!
