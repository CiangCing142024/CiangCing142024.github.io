Lenin believes that in this conclusion of Engels, \"the essence of the problem, as the essence of the state issue (the oppressed class has weapons?), Is grasped in an admirable way\".\n  <br/>\n  The Municipality of Paris was born during the avid struggle between the armed revolution and the armed counter -revolution. The 72 days of life of the Municipality of Paris were 72 days of armed insurrection, armed struggle and armed self -defense. What caused a panic fear among the bourgeois reactionaries was the\n  <span>\n   <a name=\"more\">\n   </a>\n  </span>\n  fact that the proletariat of Paris had challenged the rifle. The fatal error of the Municipality of Paris resided precisely in the fact that it proved too Clemente towards the counter -revolution and did not immediately march on Versailles, what allowed Thiers to resume breath and to gather his reactionary troops to throw himself furiously on revolutionary Paris. How did Engels said: \u201cWould the municipality of Paris last only one day if she had not served this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? On the contrary, one cannot reproach them that you have not served enough? \"\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  Comrade Mao Tse-Tung has concisely recapitulated the important meaning of the armed struggle and the popular army and formulated the famous thesis according to which \"political power stems from the rifle rod\"\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  He underlined: \"According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the main component of state power. Anyone who wants to take possession of state power and preserve it must have a strong army \".\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n  The violent revolution is a universal principle of the proletarian revolution. The Marxist-Leninist parties must firmly follow this universal principle and apply it to the concrete practice of their countries. Historical experience shows that where the proletariat and oppressed peoples took power and conquered the victory, they did it with the strength of the rifle, under the direction of the proletarian parties, in accordance with the specific conditions of their countries, constituting Gradually popular armed forces and conducting the popular war on the basis of the wide mobilization of the masses in the struggle and hiring repeated struggles against the imperialists and reactionaries. This applies to the Russian revolution, for the Chinese revolution and for the revolution of Albania, Vietnam, Korea and other countries, without any exception.\n  <br/>\n  On the contrary, when the proletarian parties do not try to create revolutionary armed forces or give up, they cause showers to the revolution; There are serious lessons in this regard. Having renounced challenging the rifle, some parties were taken abruptly in the face of an attack by surprise of imperialism and its lacquers and their counter -revolutionary repression and consequently millions of revolutionaries have been massacred; In other cases, since they wanted to obtain places of high officials in bourgeois governments or fell into the trap stretched by the reactionaries, some parties delivered them the popular armed forces, ruining the fruits of the revolution, when the revolutionary people had already challenged the weapons and the weapons Popular armed forces had already developed considerably.\n  <br/>\n  In these hundred years, many communist parties participated in the elections and entered Parliament, but none of them was able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat with this means. Even if a communist party obtains the majority in Parliament or enters the government, this does not mean that the bourgeois character of political power has changed and even less than the old state machine is demolished. The reactionary dominant class can proclaim the elections, dissolve the parliament or even resort to violence to omit the communists. If a proletarian party, instead of carrying out the work between the masses and engage in the armed struggle, supports the elections zealous\n  <br/>\n  parliamentarians, it will only fall asleep the masses and corrupt himself. The bourgeoisie buys the communist parties through the parliamentary elections and transforms them into revisionist parties, into bourgeois parties. Doesn't history provide us with numerous examples of this kind?\n  <br/>\n  The proletariat must conquer political power with the rifle and must also defend it with the rifle. A popular army under the direction of a Marxist-Leninist party is the solid pillar of the proletariat's dictatorship and the main factor between the various factors to prevent the restoration of capitalism. With a popular army armed with Marxist-Leninist ideology, you can face any situation, however complex it may be, in the class struggle both inside and outside the country and defend the power of the proletariat ...\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "Mao and the Municipality of Paris da Mao Works is of extreme importance for the revolutionary people to have the rifle in hand the historical experience of ...", "author": ["maoist"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-23-marzo-scritti-e-interventi-sulla_0266743773.html", "source_name": "proletari comunisti"}
