The decision was accepted by Luiz In\u00e1cio, who prevarious with Arruda.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It has been suspected for a long time that the camp in front of the HQ was used temporary for reactionary and family members who took part in the\n  <em>\n   bolster\n  </em>\n  From 8/1, and that the tanks served as protection for its departure before the entrance of the Military Police (PM) troops. At the time, the official justification that repercussions the most in the press was that the PM entrance was postponed to avoid a \u201cblood bath\u201d as there were armed \u201cgreen chickens\u201d in the camp that could react. However, this is not the real version of the facts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The truth is that Army Commander Julio Cesar Arruda discovered the presence of Maria Aparecida and Ticiana Villas-B\u00f4as in the camp and that they had participated in the invasion of the Pra\u00e7a dos Three Powers. The then army commander contacted Gustavo Henrique Dutra, Planalto's military commander, to set up the shielding of the armor at the entrance of the barracks and prevent the PM from entering. Dutra also received the task of talking to Luiz Inacio, informing him and convincing him to suspend the order. Dutra spoke first with General Gon\u00e7alves Dias, then Minister of GSI, and convinced him to pass to the agent. In the conversation, Dutra reported to Luiz In\u00e1cio the presence of Maria Aparecida and Ticiana, warned the president that there was a risk of upheaval if their arrest was made, since the figure of Villas-B\u00f4as is unanimous in the barracks. Luiz In\u00e1cio, thus, accepted the order.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Maria Aparecida Villas-B\u00f4as, wife of the former commander, was an extremely active figure in the articulations by the institutional rupture. She often visited camps, even hindering on one of the visits that Villas-B\u00f4as was with her and went to one of the military summit to discuss the coup.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The facts revealed explain the degree of the military crisis in which the nation is still plunged. After all, if the simple arrest of family members of a former commander could untie a process of breaking hierarchy and discipline in the barracks, the only certainty we can have is that this same hierarchy and discipline are extremely fragile. And in fact, they are: the troops have not changed, nor the essentials of their command. Who can believe that Brazil is really safe from an institutional rupture, as the liberals and opportunists suggest?\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/ex-comandante-e-governo-concordaram-em-botar-tanques-em-frente-a-acampamento-bolsonarista-para-proteger-familia-de-villas-boas/", "type": "article", "title": "Former commander and Luiz Inacio prevented arrest of 'green chickens' on 8/1 to protect family from General Villas-B\u00f4as-The New Democracy", "description": "The decision was accepted by Luiz In\u00e1cio, who prevarized with Arruda in the face of possibilities, real or not, of \"subline\".", "modified time": "2024-03-22T18:53:28-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-22T18:53:28-03:00", "author": ["Enrico Di Gregorio"], "categories": ["Situa\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica"], "tags": ["crise militar", "Governo Lula"], "sections": ["Situa\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica"], "link-section": "situacao-politica", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
