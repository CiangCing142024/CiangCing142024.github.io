And to prepare a \n 7500 jobs cut.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  In its \n simplicity this political economic news opens up to a great \n truth that today is useful to return to the fact that interests \n of the masters are antagonists, irreconcilable to those of the workers, \n of all proletarians. Simplicity of course does not mean trivial, \n We can see it if from another point of view we observe the state \n of the working class today.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  Individualism \n does enormous damage into factories, a way of being and thinking \n that the workers have absorbed and that leads to say: \u201cThe struggle puts \n At risk the workplace or mortgage, I have to think about mine \n situation\".\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  But it is life \n In the capitalist society that is at risk, that should \n scare.

There is not \n a sector, an aspect of life, working, social, cultural, \n that the popular masses cross, that it is saved, that it is not hard, a \n frightening risk or under attack of the reaction. And today still \n more in the general trend to a global enlargement of conflicts \n with the enemy of our house, imperialist and modern fascist, \n Meloni government, which drags us every day that passes into these \n wars.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  In statistics \n For poverty, workers who do not do \n they do more to reach\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n the end of the month.

And what to say about \n House, work, social services, school?\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  All this is \n closely connected to the factory, how the class acts e \n reacts in the great factories, to the need for political work \n in factories.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  In factory today \n Bourgeois ideology submits workers to production \n capitalist, he makes them \"stay in his own shell\", to use the \n Words of a worker. How do you feel different from others if you talk about \n politics, war, investments in government bonds up to \n \u20ac 50,000, which were excluded from the ISEE by the new government, if \n Do proposals look at you like an alien.\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  \u201cEverything here \n added you are still well \" - it is said - the salary and the place \n fixed they produced a poisoned fruit.

Action that overall \n feeds the subordination and passivity of the workers. I'm a \n example of this the trade union agreements that bind the salary and the \n productivity, and often also safety, to the promotion of funds \n supplementary for pensions and healthcare rather than the defense of services \n public, disputes on words of renounced and confined orders \n to the single factory.

The economism is the \n primacy of the union struggle on political struggle, the primacy \n of the trade union organization on political organization. A job \n study to be applied to the activity, to our activity, the \n theory as part of the battle, where the militants are also \n tools and target of the theoretical struggle, militants who incur \n In errors also spontaneously than curbing the development of consciousness, as can also be understood by Lenin's steps that puts in \n guard regarding the union struggle and political struggle.\n <p>\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  Dice Lenin:\n  <i>\n   \u201cThere are two policies, tradunionist policy and politics \n social democratic, given that economists do not deny the absolute \n politics but continually deviate from the Social Democratic conception, \n that is, revolutionary, towards the tradunionist conception of the \n politics, the union conception of politics. And it is not about \n give the same economic struggle or that to the struggle \n economic is already political struggle and that this is the \n method of leading to workers to politics through claims \n tangible, on the contrary. The revolutionary take advantage of the agitation \n economic not only to present claims of all kinds, \n but also first of all to claim the suppression of the regime \n autocratic\n  </i>\n  \u201d.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  Today, in this \n march context towards a modern fascist regime, everything \n it becomes politics and therefore training as a guide becomes necessary \n to action and compared to the tasks of revolutionary policy, \n Class agitation, propaganda, organization. Without doing the \n our part for a systematic party study as we can do \n the battle and bring the problem of training between the class \n worker who, as Marx says, has a successful element, the \n number, but the number does not weigh on the scale except when united \n In community and is guided by knowledge? Because political activity, work for the proletarian revolution of the party \n Communist MLM is the purpose of our struggles we organize, the reporting of the counter -information and crosses \n All tools of daily activity.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;\">\n  Training is one \n study agent, linked to daily practice, which allows \n at the forefront of taking a step forward. Today the current problem is not to do \n The revolution, but embody the first step to take it. The first step \n It is to build the avant -garde forged by the theory and the program \n necessary to do it. And that in the fire of the struggle in close link \n with the workers and the masses, it is able to transform these books \n in a practical tool, in an indication that gives us strength \n necessary to reverse the course of a horrible world e \n undertake the real struggle for a new world, founded on \n reversal of the dominant classes and the construction of proletarian power, popular with its most advanced class, the working class, the one that \n It can really change production, the social system and build \n a state suitable for transforming the economy into economics to the service of the \n people.
