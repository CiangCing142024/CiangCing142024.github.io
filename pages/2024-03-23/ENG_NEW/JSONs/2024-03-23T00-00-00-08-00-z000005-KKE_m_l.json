It is a coalition to serve and promote interests and aspirations before all its imperialist pillars. It is the incomparable contradictions between these imperialist forces that set boundaries in the \"unity\" of the project, which is anything but historical law. Brexit was a clear manifestation of these contradictions, which today occur between its two main pillars (France-Germany) and are transferred to their satellites, but are also fueled by US involvement in a number of countries and bourgeoisie in today's coalition. of \"27\".\n  </li>\n  <li li=\"\">\n   <li li=\"\">\n    <li li=\"\">\n     <li>\n      All of the above are already reflected in the political systems of all EU countries, which are facing the depreciation of the labor-like masses and are shifting in reactionary direction, and with the emergence (even in government roles) of far-right forces. Forces fueled by the general attack on the proletariat and the peoples, by the escalation of politics that stifle freedoms and democratic rights, the policy of wars and preachs of nationalism, hatred and division of peoples. At the same time, in the imperialist countries (France, Germany, but also Italy), the emergence of these far -right forces is also an expression of dissatisfaction with the megalistic class that are squeezed by imperialist competitions and seeking answers by promoting the most aggressive nationalism.\n     </li>\n    </li>\n   </li>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  The \"great upheaval\" in view of the June European elections and the criticality attributed to them by imperialists and bourgeois forces are actually referring to all the above issues. The sovereign forces seek to exploit the Europes as a tool, on the one hand to renovate it - overall in the consciences of the peoples - \"idea\" of the EU, and on dealing with problems in each country's political systems. It is very characteristic that all far -right forces are zealous in the election campaign and support the \"idea\" of the EU, without a trace of \"isolation\". They thus prove again their complete bowing both in the imperialist context and the needs of the bourgeoisie that each is mentioned.\n </p>\n <ol start=\"6\">\n  <li li=\"\">\n   <li li=\"\">\n   </li>\n  </li>\n </ol>\n <p>\n  That is why all parties in the system (from the far -right to the so -called center -left) bombard the people demanding to forget, ignore the suffering that has accumulated and accumulates from the country's integration into the EU/EMU, and to seek (with them or with them or other negotiations) in this future! That is why in the name of the \"cooperation of the peoples\" that the EU is representing, its country and its seas are transformed into a tomb and a prison of the uprooted pieces of peoples, to protect European borders from the oppressed. With the same invocation (of the \"cooperation of the peoples\"), the country is ordered in a war and hatred position with the peoples of the region to serve its Euro -Atlantic patrons!\n </p>\n <ol start=\"8\">\n  <li li=\"\">\n   <li>\n    Based on all of the above, it is also obvious than the sun that the big struggles, demands and interests of the working-bodies of Europe cannot \"meet\"-and much more justified-within the prison of the peoples that the people that the people European imperialists have formed and heard in the name of the EU! The class rights and the revolutionary perspective of the masses cannot be expressed in an instrument such as the European Parliament, which is not the conquest of the peoples, but an imperialist construction. In the complaint of this construction and the struggle against the EU lies the path of \"meeting\" the struggles, the internationalist solidarity, the development of the mass struggle of workers and peoples. This struggle forms the terms of revolutionary perspective to the extent that it is emancipated by the political context defined by the capitalist-imperialist system, to the extent that it refuses to be chased in this political context and opens its own paths.\n   </li>\n   <li>\n    In our country, prolonged election campaign in view of 9\n    <sup>\n     o\n    </sup>\n    <li>\n     The wide popular aversion and dissatisfaction with the policy of the ND government, the policy of the system and all the parties that support it - from the so -called center -left (SYRIZA, PASOK, Cruise, New Left) and from the far -right (Velopoulos, Niki) - It does not fit into the \"official gallop\" of the European elections. It should not be perverted by blackmailing the acceptance of imperialist dependence on the EU.\n     <strong>\n      The people have no reason to share the upheaval and reactionary processes of the political system.
