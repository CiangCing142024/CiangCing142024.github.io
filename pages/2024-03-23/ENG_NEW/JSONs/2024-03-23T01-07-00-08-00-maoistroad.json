On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the\n  <br/>\n  British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the\n  <br/>\n  success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to\n  <br/>\n  the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat\n  <br/>\n  Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we\n  <br/>\n  have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded\n  <br/>\n  with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly\n  <br/>\n  opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including\n  <br/>\n  Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack\n  <br/>\n  the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them\n  <br/>\n  and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.\n  <br/>\n  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:\n  <br/>\n  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire\n  <br/>\n  economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and\n  <br/>\n  native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of\n  <br/>\n  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their\n  <br/>\n  Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.\n  <br/>\n  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and\n  <br/>\n  displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to\n  <br/>\n  face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,\n  <br/>\n  Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure\n  <br/>\n  was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more\n  <br/>\n  and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly\n  <br/>\n  implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to\n  <br/>\n  the toiling masses.\n  <br/>\n  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open\n  <br/>\n  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India,\n  <br/>\n  Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro-\n  <br/>\n  imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over\n  <br/>\n  the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country\n  <br/>\n  through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and\n  <br/>\n  communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today\n  <br/>\n  the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.\n  <br/>\n  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out\n  <br/>\n  from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has\n  <br/>\n  abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the\n  <br/>\n  resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of\n  <br/>\n  India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the\n  <br/>\n  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green-\n  <br/>\n  Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous\n  <br/>\n  people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis\n  <br/>\n  ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive\n  <br/>\n  deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from\n  <br/>\n  the Adivasi region. People's resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are\n  <br/>\n  being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific\n  <br/>\n  news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until\n  <br/>\n  and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid\n  <br/>\n  on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has\n  <br/>\n  developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the\n  <br/>\n  people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this\n  <br/>\n  enemy's machines and methods.\n  <br/>\n  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and\n  <br/>\n  women's organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists\n  <br/>\n  to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct\n  <br/>\n  seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideals of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in order to expose the\n  <br/>\n  treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n  <b>\n   <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n    Down with Imperialism!\n    <br/>\n    Down with Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism!\n    <br/>\n    Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!\n    <br/>\n    Long Live Comrade Bhagat Singh, Comrade Sukdev, and Comrade Rajguru!\n    <br/>\n    Inquilab Zindabad!\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   <span style=\"font-size: medium;\">\n   </span>\n  </b>\n  <br/>\n  With Revolutionary Greetings,\n  <br/>\n  Pratap\n  <br/>\n  Spokesperson\n  <br/>\n  Central Regional Bureau\n  <br/>\n  Communist Party of India (Maoist)\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "Let us defeat Imperialism.
