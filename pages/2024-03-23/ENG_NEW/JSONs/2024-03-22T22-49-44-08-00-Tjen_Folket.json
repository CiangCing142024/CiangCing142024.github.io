In addition, this platform will be built with Ithaca Energy. They are owned by Israeli Delek Group. Which is blacklisted by the UN and is a company that contributes to the illegal Israeli settlements. We require the government to follow up its self -esteem report for Equinor. There, they write that companies like Equinor should follow science -based climate goals, cut emissions in line with these, and that they will enter into cooperation with actors who respect international humanitarian law. That's what we stand for here today. That Equinor has a room for maneuver that they should use. They should end the Rose Bank platform and should end the cooperation with Ithaca Energy. \u201d\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kZDPEZ8gwt93CoV7S1oUZONLUea5DtLzAgH3eLW7RnBcoD48bJnF3mBl7Ll-6R8aZcYYePr0NEEuySYrF8w6GNNvJfO3pX3MqrWC6nojMQaMMQ6nsYryDIJey3q9vERSPkdyD5-VrbhWokts68x8gWM\" srcset=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kZDPEZ8gwt93CoV7S1oUZONLUea5DtLzAgH3eLW7RnBcoD48bJnF3mBl7Ll-6R8aZcYYePr0NEEuySYrF8w6GNNvJfO3pX3MqrWC6nojMQaMMQ6nsYryDIJey3q9vERSPkdyD5-VrbhWokts68x8gWM\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Several participants in the action were also interviewed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  An activist explains why such demonstration forms need:\n </p>\n <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n  <p>\n   \u201cBecause it is very tragic. The politicians do not listen to us. They have no respect for opinion in Norway and the will of the people. And when you resort to more disobedient and desperate methods. Like strike and civil disobedience. Everything is needed to end the genocide and the occupation. \"\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Another activist explained it like this:\n </p>\n <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n  <p>\n   \u201cIt's about Equinor's reputation. If people are going to see what Equinor is doing we have to take a seat, we have to scream loudly. It is not enough. We don't think they want to talk to us even if we try it. The environmental movement has tried it many times. Equinor is not an actor you can have a dialogue with I think. \u201d\n   <br/>\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The activist explains why dialogue with Equinor is not working:\n </p>\n <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n  <p>\n   <br/>\n   \u201cBecause the entire company is built on the principle of the entire environment can be utilized and also that vulnerable people can be exploited. Yes, they may have a dialogue with us, but Equinor cannot exist if they do not do such things. \"\n  </p>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n   <img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/9PEe8sp37_A4dbW1BKKO8Dt6AEj05aVCT5-FdaRW3vlj8zrDAW9wyctPc6cIEdrKC-LDZTiKJwwoivk2FkwsLrCILXmXcFhcgmVgG8241cumU6GXULY58fbozYPx63fHFlI1X3AXrE6JkIXfN65gGS4\" srcset=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/9PEe8sp37_A4dbW1BKKO8Dt6AEj05aVCT5-FdaRW3vlj8zrDAW9wyctPc6cIEdrKC-LDZTiKJwwoivk2FkwsLrCILXmXcFhcgmVgG8241cumU6GXULY58fbozYPx63fHFlI1X3AXrE6JkIXfN65gGS4\"/>\n  </figure>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  <br/>\n  The activist ended with:\n </p>\n <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n  <p>\n   \u201cIt is very nice to gather the environmental movement and the Palestinian movement here today. It is very important. To explain and show that these problems have something to do with each other. I think solidarity is what determines whether a movement survives or collapses. We need a critical mass. That's the whole point in what we do. I am very proud to see this collaboration. \u201d\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  After 9 o'clock, the action ended after there were no longer cars to see in the area. The shareholders succeeded in revealing the collaboration state -owned Equinor has with Israeli Ithaca Energy, which contributes to the occupation. At the same time, a signal was sent that the companies cannot work as normal while contributing to an ongoing genocide.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kh_dhoXIk_tld24t62mrUOJ3iodyvSgyIYhJGPBTTLEVajyK0_ujrC-gS5qcUwdvCSiPcu5xe-a6ardmWYWY3etJZS5FbGGp09ILNluUQbR-23A0dONfzwLZEWvtJIsl61BRopJv8T_2_lHL3ZODEFw\" srcset=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kh_dhoXIk_tld24t62mrUOJ3iodyvSgyIYhJGPBTTLEVajyK0_ujrC-gS5qcUwdvCSiPcu5xe-a6ardmWYWY3etJZS5FbGGp09ILNluUQbR-23A0dONfzwLZEWvtJIsl61BRopJv8T_2_lHL3ZODEFw\"/>\n </figure>\n</section>\n", "source": "https://tjen-folket.no/2024/03/22/bergen-aktivister-blokkerte-equinor-for-palestina/", "type": "article", "title": "Bergen: activists blocked Equinor for Palestine", "description": "Earn Folket Media was present at a demonstration outside Equinor's office at Sandsli in Bergen.
