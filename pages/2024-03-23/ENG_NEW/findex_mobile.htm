  15 people are killed in Gaza, six of them children, 35 people are injured and 12 buildings are destroyed. In total at least 31,726 people have been killed by the state of Israel since the beginning of the current genocidal campaign. More than 73,792 people have been injured and more than 8,000 are missing, and half of homes in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged.

  While the imperialists act as if what happened in Gaza was some kind of natural disaster, where all they try to do is give a small help, what is happening is not a mystery. Even UN agents, dominated by Yankee imperialism, say
  <a href="https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1770068341551452168">
   implicitly
  </a>
  that the state of Israel are using starvation as a weapon of war.

  War laws, how often the imperialists regularly deny unless they serve their interests, are clearly defined and are well known to all soldiers of any army. The ruptures of these laws are considered war crimes.
  <a href="https://www.icrc.org/es/doc/resources/documents/treaty/treaty-gc-4-5tdkyk.htm">
   Article 55
  </a>
  of the fourth convention of Geneva clearly declares that the state of Israel is responsible for the needs of the people under their occupation:
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-325fb4ad8e1e3783f219ec00eff58b9e">
  “
  <em>
   To the entire measure of its resources, the occupant power has the duty to supply the population in food and medical products; Especially you must import food, medicines and any other necessary article when the resources of the occupied territory are insufficient. ”
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1b8957417381caed71362d68c1ed7cc7">
  The facts on the situation in Gaza, clearly show that the state of Israel is committing a war crime breaking this law.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-24ebad4b1b808d34ca6ffb0520f03bb5">
  On January 26, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) made a

  <em>
   “The State of Israel must, according to its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, in relation to the Palestinians in Gaza, take all the measures in their hand to avoid the commission of all acts of face to what was said in article II of this convention.

   denunciated
  </a>
  This despite the fact that ICJ's criteria is that Israel continues to block Gaza deliberately. Among the various methods, the state of Israel does so as follows: blocking help by creating bottlenecks only allowing help through two crosses; imposing a bureaucratic inspection system which delays trucks, on average for 20 days; and rejecting the necessary supplies such as fuel, generators, protective material and communications equipment, stating that this can only be used for military purposes.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b339d147e4593f1a5603bb38acb049be">
  But not only neglecting to provide the employed population with the necessary supplies, also blocking other parts of doing so, the state of Israel is also eating a war crime breaching article 23 of the Fourth Convention of Geneva. This article requires states that "the free step of all shipping of medicines and health material" for civilians and "will also allow the free step of any shipment of indispensable food, clothes and tonic reserved for children of less than fifteen years and for women or parturients. "
  <a href="https://www.icrc.org/es/document/protocolo-i-adicional-convenios-ginebra-1949-proteccion-victimas-conflictos-armados-internacionales-1977">
   Paragraph 2 of article 70
  </a>
  of the additional protocol for conventions expands this obligation:
  <em>
   "2. The parties in conflict and the high contracting parts will allow and facilitate the quick and unblocking step of all shipments, materials and relief personnel provided in accordance with the provisions of this section, even in the event that such assistance is intended for the civil population of the adverse part. "
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3bc6ebec3890468b3fe4295ca7a75da6">
  Paragraph 1 of article 54 of the additional protocol I to the Geneva conventions defines the use of starvation as a gun of war, as a war crime:
  <em>
   “
  </em>
<em>
   1. It is prohibited, as a war method, to make civilians suffer hungry. ”
  </em>
  Subsequently in paragraph 2 of the same article, establishes that:
  <em>
   "2. It is prohibited to attack, destroy, subtract or use the indispensable assets for the survival of the civilian population, such as food items and agricultural areas that produce them, crops, livestock, facilities and reserves of drinking water and the works of Irrigation, with the deliberate intention of depriving of these assets, for their value as means to ensure subsistence, civil population or adverse part, whatever reason, either to make civilians suffer hungry, to provoke your displacement, or with any other purpose.

  While they ignore the obvious war crimes committed by the state of Israel, the imperialists, acting as if it were a natural disaster, try to give the impression that they want to help the people of Gaza with insufficient measures such as air throws of material. When these

  After failing the parachutes, they are still a drop in the ocean for the Palestinian hungry. German imperialism has deployed two transport aircraft to launch help on Gaza, however these aircraft can only transport 18 tons each. This is less than the capacity of a truck, which usually has about 20 tons. While the population of Gaza needs around 500 help trucks every day, they have only entered Gaza 2,874 trucks in February, less than 100 per day. The current trend is that this amount of help is decreasing.

  The Mediterranean, Africa and the Middle East are the other front 
 of war lit by the interimperialist dispute, with troops 
 military of imperialist governments on the ground to strengthen the axis 
 of terror, together with their Zionist ally, against the Arab peoples 
 with Palestine in the center.

  This 
 war front is strategic for the Italian imperialist state, ce 
 The governments and the so -called are repeating it until nausea 
 "Analysts" close to the Italian military-industrial apparatus, e 
 The Meloni/Crosetto/Tajani government is precisely on interventionism 
 Italian imperialist who focuses a lot, Meloni swelled it 
 so much so as to push the press enslaved to baptize it “Piano 
 Mattei ”, to give him an apparently strategic guise for 
 Instead, hiding the reality made of refusals contracted to 
 reactionary governments, of profits derived from the robbery of resources 
 energy and from the goods that pass through the area, of imposition 
 of the iron heel of the imperialist armies to crush the 
 aspirations of peoples and dominating the world trade that passes 
 in the Red Sea.

  In 
 This context on Sunday 17 March was held in the visit to Cairo del 
 President of the Council of Italian Ministers, Meloni, together with 
 President of the European Commission, von der Leyen, always 
 available when he has to support the racist policies of 
 Antimmigrati rejections in the company of the Government Capa of 
 Italian (nobody can and must forget the massacre of migrants a

  The 
 Cairo from the EU is considered "reliable partner", a 
 "Mediterranean security pillar", as we read 
 in the joint declaration.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Furthermore 
 The adjective "historical" could not miss this time even 
 in defining political, commercial, military agreements. Each step 
 politician of the Meloni government rests on empty words that cloak the 
 His imperialist, neocolonial politics.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This 
 of the European partnership was one of the legs on which the

 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  With the 
 Agreements with Libya, Tunisia and Albania, the Meloni government pursues the 
 same way also with Egypt his policy to prevent the 
 departures of migrants fleeing hunger and wars with concentration camps where 
 lock them up, a policy strengthened by the Meloni/planted government 
 of criminalization/repression of the NGOs engaged in the rescue in 
 sea.
 </p>
<p p="" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   “The crisis of Gaza 
 It is at the top of our concerns, "said Meloni but,, 
 Since he did absolutely nothing to stop the genocide 
 of the Israeli Nazisionist state against Gaza and all of Palestine 
 occupied and bombed, the so -called "concerns" of his and the 
 governments are only for preventing the departures of migrants e 
 suffocate the support also armed with the resistance of the people of the 
 Yemen, defined by the "Ribelli Houthi" press, which, in the name of 
 that solidarity with the Palestinian people, affects the interests 
 of imperialism that instead supports the terrorist n ° 1 of the area, 
 the Nazisionist state of Israel and attacks the goods of the 
 Imperialists passing through the Red Sea.
  </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   THE 
 regimes asserted for imperialism thus become a sting 
 indispensable and imperialist governments of them spin rivers of 
 money. In Italy this pompously call it "Piano Mattei" 
 and the model that the Italian government is proud of is that 
 signed with Sieda's Tunisia last September, also, 
 Not surprisingly, baptized by Meloni and von der Leyen.
  </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The fire 
 of the war - or rather - of the genocide in progress in Palestine from 
 part of the Naziosionist occupant of Israel, supported 
 from western imperialism with the US on their heads and with the role 
 Active, accomplice, of the Italy of the Meloni government, has broken down in 
 Middle, for the support of the resistance of Yemen to 
 Palestinian resistance and with the influx of weapons, military, US/EU 
 in the Red Sea with the aim of extinguishing political solidarity 
 and military of the peoples to the Palestinian cause and for open support 
 to the Nazisionist genocide.
  </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Hold up 
 Al-Sisi means first of all to run to help him to support 
 The whole apparatus of domination of the coup, from the military to the banks, 
 who brought the Egyptian people to their knees to which they now do 
 add the migratory waves from Gaza and Sudan, created by 
 same imperialists.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The rejections of the 
 migrants will be one of the themes of the G7 so it is a central question for 
 An anti -imperialist struggle.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   The initiative 
 European follows the economic support that Egypt is 
 insured by the United Arab Emirates and the Monetary Fund 
 international (IMF). Between the end of February and the beginning of March 
 Cairo received 10 billion dollars provided by a fund 
 Emiratine. A project that provides for an initial investment of 35 
 billions of dollars and which will allow you to replenish the coffers of the 
 State, on which they burdened the effects of the war in the strip 
 of Gaza. On 6 March, the IMF announced that it wants to increase 
 from 3 to 8 billion dollars the value of the loan that will provide 
 to Egypt in exchange for the economic reforms that, translated, 
 It means downloading with repression, with imposition, the whole 
 austerity policy of the Egyptian reactionary regime against his 
 same people.
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   On the situation 
 Egyptian economic weighs a debt that, according to World data 
 Bank of September 2023, amounts to 164.5 billion dollars. The rate 
 of annual inflation rose to 36% in January, without possibility 
 of contraction within a short time - also because the central bank 
 has decided to make the pound exchange rate flexible 
 Egyptian (now exchanged at 50 per dollar, against the 30 average of the 
 2023).
  </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
   Help 
 economically the coup at Sisi means, as a counterpart, 
 obtain his involvement in the repression of migrants and, for 
 Italian imperialism, this also means the profits related 
 to the exploitation of energy resources, strategic topic for 
 the imperialist countries, which for this reason are scanning and there are there 
 dragging into the world slaughterhouse.

    For Italy 
 imperialist represented by the Meloni government was 
 sign an agreement with the Golder at Sisi precisely coinciding with 
 The hearing of the trial for the death of Giulio Regeni, the young man 
 Italian researcher, killed and tortured horribly by the services 
 Egyptian secrets of which he is headed by Sisi, and this hearing began the 
 March 18 in Rome.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    Nothing can put 
 The relations between Italy and Egypt are under discussion, they do not count 
 massacres or human rights violations, indeed, are strengthened 
 the civil business and, above all, the military one that has grown 
 dizzyingly, with the Fincantieri and the 
 Leonardo.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    On this the 
 Egyptian president at Sisi, in the presence of Eni's AD, Claudio 
 Descalzi, declared that "the assassination was committed for 
 ruin relations with Italy "and" to damage Egypt " 
 and, aimed at Descalzi, “knows why they wanted to damage the 
 Relations between Egypt and Italy? So that we did not arrive here ”. But 
 Not only have they arrived so far, they also went on.
   </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    In the last five 
 years the Italian war industries exported to the strength 
 armed with Al Sisi, the former head of the Egyptian Golder Army, from 
 Little re -elected triumphantly for the third time, for the value 
 total of two billion and 39 million euros. According to the 
 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), in fact, 
 For 2024 3 billion dollars would already be at stake for 
 the purchase of twenty-four Eurofighter Typhoon-2 hunting hunting 
 of Cairo.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
    So, behind the 
 propaganda of this government, there is the substance of politics 
 Italian imperialist: antimmigratic profits and rejections.
   </p>

    And against it it is

     Epistle of the poets that will come
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">
    Manuel Scorza
   </p>
<p>
<em>
     Maybe tomorrow the poets ask
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Why we do not celebrate the grace of the girls;
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Maybe tomorrow the poets ask
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Why our poems
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     They were long avenues
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     where the burning anger came.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     I answer:
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Everywhere we heard the crying,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Everywhere we were a wall of black waves.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Was it going to be poetry
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     A lonely dew column?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It had to be perpetual lightning.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     While someone suffers,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The rose cannot be beautiful;
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     While someone looked at the bread with envy,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Wheat cannot sleep;
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     While it rains on the beggars's chest,
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     My heart will not smile.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Kill sadness, poets.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Let's kill sadness with a stick.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Do not say the romance of the lilies.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     There are higher things
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     What to cry lost loves:
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The rumor of a town that awakens
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It's more beautiful than dew!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The glowing metal of its anger
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It is more beautiful than the foam!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     A free man
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     It is more pure than the diamond!
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The poet will release the fire
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     of his ash prison.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     The poet will turn on the bonfire
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     Where this gloomy world is burned.

  In recent months, more than 4,326 hectares of land were affected by terrible forest fires caused by the landowner or arising as a phenomenon of the Seiaje season. In addition to this, in various regions of Oaxaca such as the central valleys, Mixteca and Costa, mainly, a water crisis that threatens whole populations, and now also to hospitals and public schools has been observed.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The clear example is the situation of the General Hospital “Dr. Aurelio Valdivieso ”, in the middle of Oaxaca capital, which on February 22 had to suspend tasks to run out of water. Obviously a hospital cannot work without providing minimal health conditions for patients and medical personnel, and for this the drinking water service is indispensable. In this regard, the Human Rights Ombudsman of Oaxaca initiated a background notebook and issued precautionary measures where he asks
  <em>
   "Comprehensive actions to the State that avoid producing damage of difficult or impossible reparation to detriment to the right to citizenship."
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Now, in the same capital of the entity, there is talk of at least 6 public schools that have had to suspend tasks and return to the online classes to the total shortage of water in its facilities. The most recent have been the Morning Elementary School "Carlos A. Carrillo", located in the Reforma neighborhood, and the morning elementary school "Enrique Pestalozzi", located in the center of the city. Leave childhood without access to drinking water within its schools also attentive against their right to education and health, among others contemplated within the best interests of childhood.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Until a few weeks ago the shortage of drinking water was concentrated in the popular colonies generally located on the periphery and the hills of the city, nothing new. For decades there are dozens of colonies and neighborhoods called “irregular settlements” where the poor people do not have access to drinking water or other public services; In the same situation there are hundreds of schools in those same neighborhoods. The different governments in turn have systematically ignored this situation, leaving the solution in the hands of the residents who have had to hire private pipes that take advantage of the era of the era to speculate with water prices.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  But now that the water crisis has reached the downtown area of the city and the "good" colonies such as Reforma, San Felipe, etc. The situation has become a scandal; Even more when visible public institutions such as the General Hospital and the aforementioned schools must have suspended work at the shortage of water.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At the same time in Oaxaca, cooling companies and breweries continue to work normally, as are large hotels, restaurants, vice centers and even spas that prepare for Holy Week and beautiful tourism. None of these are lacking water at all.
 </p>
<p>
  Are we facing a phenomenon of drought or looting? You answer.
 </p>

<p>
  After an agreement with the government, the National Congress today approved a project of the new high school. The project has undergone some modifications, but maintained the essentials of the content was criticized for months in strikes and protests of teachers and students across the country, as hundreds of hours for optional subjects without scientific content and models harmful to complete school education .
 </p>
<p>
  Within the one approved by the House, is:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
   Loss of hours of scientific training: In regular education, the division will be 2,400 hours for compulsory subjects and 600 hours for optional subjects. In other words, the loss of 600 hours in traditional and essential disciplines in high school for “formative itineraries”, mostly composed, especially in public schools, of disciplines without scientific content, such as “computational thinking”, “life project And similar aberrations. In technical education, the division will be 2,100 hours for compulsory subjects, with the possibility of 300 of them being compatible between basic general training and technical education, and 1,200 hours for the chosen technical course.
  </li>
<li>
   Discipline umbrella: fusion of different disciplines essential to student education in “large areas”, made mandatory. They are: languages and their technologies, which integrates Portuguese language and literature; English language; Arts (multiple languages and expressions); physical education; mathematics and their technologies; Natural Sciences and their Technologies, which will bring together important disciplines such as biology, physical and chemistry in a single great umbrella; and applied human and social sciences, which will do the same with philosophy, geography, history and sociology.
  </li>
<li>
   Formative itineraries: In the new project, each regular (non -technical) school should offer at least two formative itineraries. These optional disciplines should contemplate at least one of the above areas, but there is no clear specification of how much content or menu should be related to scientific areas, so that it leaves the space for anticientific courses like those that have been massively implemented in schools that They adopted the measure in the last year; In technical schools, there is the option of training the technical and professional training course;
  </li>
<li>
   Formalization of Distance Learning: The project has established that formative itineraries can be taught at a distance, while the basic general training workload can be offered in person and, exceptionally, “mediated by technology”. There is not yet a regulation that specifies how mediation will be given.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Far-right celebrates
 </h4>
<p>
  After approval, parliamentarians of the far right were rushed to celebrate the text agreed between the government and the congress. The new chairman of the House Education Commission, the notorious reactionary Nikolas Ferreira (PL-MG), was one of those who praised the approved project. In a note published on social networks, the deputy cynically stated that he will maintain high supervision by applying the measure and the “demands of our students”.
 </p>
<p>
  The comment is a blatant derision: approval directly contradicted the interests of students and teachers who criticized and condemned even in important mobilizations across the country throughout the last year. Instead of a reformulation in neither, teachers and students required the total revocation of the measure.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Changed, but left the same
 </h4>
<p>
  In the new approval, all the content criticized by the students do not even remained. In strikes, student occupations, and protests, education professionals and students required the end of “formative itineraries” and the return of the schedule for regular disciplines and condemned the widespread confusion caused by the fusion of multiple scientific disciplines in widespread. Distance learning was also, as a rule, rejected in the demonstrations. Entities such as the National Executive of Pedagogy Students (Exnepe), who coordinated campaigns and fights against Nem, even classified the reform as the “most serious attack on public education in recent years”.
 </p>
<p>
  Denunciations after the application of the measure also reveals how it does not even favor the precariousness of teaching work, with professionals subject to increasing exploitation, in exhaustive hours and work not related to their areas of training, the precariousness of teaching, especially the public and Free, with the offer of an anti -cinientific and pragmatist teaching (not technical education, such as propagands figures such as Nikolas Ferreira), consequently, school dropout.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Fight must be resumed
 </h4>
<p>
  Even so, the government has never really considered to meet the requirement to revoke the neither and opted for conciliation with the measure. Last month, the Minister of Education, Camilo Santana, said he expected to approve the measure “this semester, because to implement changes in high school to 2025 need to be approved this semester, because it needs to have the time for the networks to be prepare for change. Approval is essential this semester in the House and Senate ”.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, the climate that can be expected is to resume students' struggles against Nem and the coming attacks on education promoted by the celemented reactionaries and conciliators on duty.

 Lenin says that to develop the political consciousness of the proletariat, it is necessary to bring the denunciation of every manifestation of will and oppression to the working class.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  But of course, does it act immediately after the problem "How to do it? Do we have enough forces to do it? Is there a terrain for this work in all other classes? Will it not mean this or will not lead this to a renunciation of the class point of view?".
 </p>
<p>
  Even more justified questions if we look today, under the conditions of organization, numbers and paintings of the communist organization, and in particular of ours. Questions to which the easy answer that comes is No.
 </p>
<p>
  But Lenin's answer is other. He starts from the assumption that the communists are primarily "theoretical ... propagandists, agitators and organizers". And he adds: "But very little is done in this sense. Too little compared to what is done for the study of the peculiarities of factory life", indeed - we say - of the attention that lends itself to the life and struggles of the other sectors of workers. Lenin insists that there are
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 companions, committees, etc. who even sink into the specialist study of trade union struggles, while they do not do, or do to extremely limited extent, the work that Lenin asks to actually raise the consciousness of workers and workers in struggle.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Their commitment made in the trade union struggles forgets that - as Lenin says - "it is not social democratic those who in fact forget that the communists support any revolutionary motorcycle and that, consequently, we must expose, underline the general tasks before all the people, without hiding even for a moment our socialist beliefs ", and educating in our work in the factory and proletarian struggles the workers and the proletariat in general to deal with all general problems and put themselves at the forefront of all democratic political struggles that develop In society, first of all, in the initial phase, with position sockets.
 </p>
<p>
  The forces to do this are there. The alternative that economists and economist mentality in the communists' ranks suggest to us is to "develop a tradunionist policy". And on this Lenin is stakeholder:
  <b>
   "The tradunionist policy of the working class is precisely the
   <i>
    Bourgeois Politics
   </i>
   of the working class ".
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Even in the other sectors and movements to which we turn, the action of the communists does not consist so much in directing the struggle for their immediate interests - for example the struggle of the students - but in bringing the position of the communists, the position of the Party of the working class; Because only in this way is Lenin realize: "We must transform social democratic militants into political leaders who know how to direct all the manifestations of this struggle" and are able to dictate in this struggle "a positive action program to students in agitation, To the representatives of the dissatisfied Zemstva, to the members of the indignant religious seven, to the masters affected in their interests, etc. ".
 </p>
<p>
  This is to be a revolutionary vanguard and an expression of the workers' vanguard that we have called to take a stand, and through it to begin to react to all forms of political and social oppression of the bourgeoisie, its state, its government.
 </p>
<p>
  If this is, therefore, the task of the communists, permanent of the communists, if it is understood that this is a task to be fulfilled from the beginning of our activity, one can understand the attention that at this point Lenin places on the actual forces that You have, and consider the inevitable type of activity for granted at the beginning: "We actually had very few strength. Then it was natural and legitimate to be determined entirely in the work between the workers and seriously blame any removal from it, then the only purpose It was to strengthen in the working class ".
 </p>
<p>
  Here too, however, the problem is: with what conception, with what practice, with what propaganda and agitation do you jump entirely among the workers and strengthen ourselves in the working class? With trade union policy, tradunionist, with its economist's development, or with communist policy, albeit at the beginning of the process of roots and organization for the construction of the party? With the idea that in the working class this work cannot be done, which comes after we have conducted the trade union activity and consequently to the development of it, or with propaganda and agitation, albeit in the very difficult conditions that are there today in Fila of the working class?
 </p>
<p>
  Here too Lenin is very precise: "The ideal audience for political complaints is precisely the working class, which needs first of all and above all of a lively and complete political knowledge and which is the most suitable for transforming this knowledge into active struggle, even if this does not promise any "tangible result".
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, this is the only way that the working class has to become a point of reference for the struggle and opposition of all the layers of society. And this is the growing role that the working class, first with the avant -garde only with the active struggle, can allow us to "become a political force in the eyes of others". And to become this "you have to work a lot and with tenacity to raise our conscience, our spirit of initiative and our energy". And - insists Lenin - "It is not enough to attack the avant -garde label on a theory and a rearguard practice".

  The Madrid popular movement managed to avoid the eviction of the CPK (Kolelectivized political center) La Bankarrota, which was scheduled on Wednesday, March 20. The eviction was scheduled at 08: 00h and the presence of the UIP (Police Intervention Unit), the riot. The Buitre “Arguijo” Fund wanted to expel the masses that were organized to conquer it, which in its day snatched the financial entity Caja Madrid. But the police, a faithful prey dog of the financial capital (embodied this time in the vulture background "argue"), I cannot dislodge the center.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2ad6116eaf4ec54313d7997f5f53a403">
  The presence of the masses was greater and better organized than the State's repression forces could think. Seeing that there was not enough police presence to execute the eviction, those responsible for eviction sent to the Judicial Commission to delay it and mark a new date (even without schedule, that we know, today). In this way the eviction was avoided: with the organization and mobilization of the masses, which before 08:00, presented themselves in the surroundings willing to put their body before the riot units. Although this victory is temporary and the financial capital will try again to snatch the building, we are sure that the popular movement will defend, once again, these physical spaces of political organization of the working class.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-81220136960a497065038e35b73e5ac8">
  The CPK La Bankarrota has been a physical center of political organization of the masses, especially those of the Moratalaz neighborhood, which is where it is located (Palacios Encomienda street, number 46). In the call to defend the social center, CPK itself wrote: “
  <em>
   During the last 9 years, the Bankarrota has served as a meeting space for multiple groups of Moratalaz and Madrid. From here evictions have stopped, they have been able to raise funds for repressive expenses, very interesting talks and debates have been made, it has served as a political refuge for many organizations
  </em>
  ”.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-206adddb063cdc5b8154877ba09e83cf">
  The defense of the CPK La Bankarrota is a breath of fresh air in a month of intense heat. On March 13, the Railway (also in Madrid) and the CSO L’Obrera (Sabadell) was evicted. A day later, on 14, CSO Loira (Zaragoza). In fact, this concatenation of repressive acts is such that a good part of the popular movement considers that this March has begun one "
  <em>
   War against social centers ”.
  </em>
  This war will be a long one, with evictions to be won and others to be lost, but the struggle must continue until there is a
  <em>
   Ten, one hundred, thousand social centers!
  </em>
  [slogan that was heard in the mobilization that avoided the eviction].
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c6a0d153e5222992405a41c5994f5ccb">
  The author of this article considers that this
  <em>
   guerra
  </em>
  It is part of the crisis and decomposition process of imperialism, and militarization of states. In this specific case, the offensive against social centers is within the logic of the Spanish state militarization process. Moreover, taking into account the maximum importance of the housing sector in our country, where financial capital is particularly more aggressive than in other sectors of the economy. It is enough to remember that the financial capital skips all bourgeois legality when required. The best example is that their most reactionary shock troops (landslide companies) are openly fascist pseudo-paramilitaries.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6e1d2961a81fee07dbe72905d10afef0">
  We will be alert until you know which eviction is.

   The green-black state government of the CDU and the Greens promised the parents and children in North Rhine-Westphalia better all-day care at primary schools.
  </a>
  The state government planned a law that guarantees a secure claim for all -day care in schools. This law would not only relieve parents and in particular mothers and enable them to better reconcile wage labor and raising children or to have a little more free time in stressful everyday life, but would also guarantee the children better school and extracurricular support. And in general, the law would make a positive contribution to the otherwise increasingly overloaded school system.
 </p>
<p>
  The state law was originally planned as a necessary addition and accomplement to the federal law decided in 2021 that formulated a legal claim to all -day care in primary schools. From the school year 2026/27, the law would be implemented with the enrollment of the first graders and would then gradually be introduced by 2029/30 to the fourth grade. The law in North Rhine -Westphalia should then regulate how the all -day tour should be implemented by whom and which content and supervisory standards must be taken into account when filling the positions.
 </p>
<p>
  Instead, the state government breaks its promise to the parents and children in the country and is limited to so-called "guidelines", which reproduce nothing but the legal entitlement of the Federal Law and ruminate the status quo. A full -day place will include eight hours per school day. How this will be implemented and who will be responsible for the care should be decided on site, according to the state school minister Dorothee Feller.

  On the 8

   th
  </sup>
  of March a combative and anti-imperialist contingent took part to the demonstration organized by Fosse aux Lyons and CFP. This contingent expressed their support to the heroic Palestinian national resistance and especially the women of Gaza. The protesters carried a banner with the slogans “Support for our sisters in Gaza who fight against imperialism and patriarchy! Palestine will win!” and shouted slogans in support of armed struggle, against Zionism and imperialism. Several speeches took a stance against US imperialism and Zionism, and also French imperialism and its treatment of the Mahorese women was condemned. Nouvelle Epoque reports that the contingent was well received among the masses.

The panel was attended by women representatives of the League of Poor Peasants of the Northeast (LCP-NE), a representative of the Committee for the Defense of the Agrarian Revolution (CDRA) of the José Ricardo Revolutionary Area and a teacher from the Elizabete Teixeira People’s School. During the event, a daycare service was organized in order to allow peasant mothers to take part. Following the Internationale, the principles of the People’s Women’s Movement were presented and there was reading and discussion about the origin of the 8

  of March, a part of the MFP bulletin. At the end, it was discussed and defined how women could increase their participation in the struggle to recover water sources and land from the old Frei Caneca plantation. In this way, the plenary session led the formation of an agitation and propaganda committee to recover water sources and organize a daycare service so that women can actively participate in recovering the land. The session ended with the Anthem of the Revolutionary Fighters and many slogans from the warriors of the southern forest of Pernambuco.

  by members of the ruling classes, with posters published accusing some of the women of vandalism, as well as intimidation and detention carried out by the police against women for such reasons as wearing green or purple scarves. Now women’s organizations are denouncing that the old State is quick to repress the protest of women but don’t punish the murderers and rapists of women. Posters have been put up and slogans have been painted by revolutionary women condemning the criminalization of protest.

Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2.

Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.

In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3.

The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/><br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5. The decision shall be in writing and shall contain a full and reasoned statement of the Trial Chamber's  findings on the evidence and conclusions. The Trial Chamber shall issue one decision.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3. Where paragraph 2 applies, any representations under article 75 shall be heard during the further hearing  referred to in paragraph 2 and, if necessary, during any additional hearing.  4. The sentence shall be pronounced in public and, wherever possible, in the presence of the accused.<br/><br/>38 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 7.   PENALTIES Article 77   Applicable penalties 1. Subject to article 110, the Court may impose one of the following penalties on a person convicted of a crime  referred to in article 5 of this Statute:  (a) Imprisonment for a specified number of years, which may not exceed a maximum of 30 years; or  (b) A term of life imprisonment when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual  circumstances of the convicted person. 2. In addition to imprisonment, the Court may order:  (a) A fine under the criteria provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) A forfeiture of proceeds, property and assets derived directly or indirectly from that crime, without  prejudice to the rights of bona fide third parties. Article 78   Determination of the sentence 1.

In imposing a sentence of imprisonment, the Court shall deduct the time, if any, previously spent in  detention in accordance with an order of the Court. The Court may deduct any time otherwise spent in  detention in connection with conduct underlying the crime.  3. When a person has been convicted of more than one crime, the Court shall pronounce a sentence for each  crime and a joint sentence specifying the total period of imprisonment. This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2. The Court may order money and other property collected through fines or forfeiture to be transferred, by  order of the Court, to the Trust Fund.  3. The Trust Fund shall be managed according to criteria to be determined by the Assembly of States Parties.  Article 80   Non-prejudice to national application of penalties and national laws Nothing in this Part affects the application by States of penalties prescribed by their national law, nor the law of  States which do not provide for penalties prescribed in this Part. <br/><br/>39 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 8.   APPEAL AND REVISION Article 81   Appeal against decision of acquittal or conviction or against sentence 1. A decision under article 74 may be appealed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence as  follows:  (a) The Prosecutor may make an appeal on any of the following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact, or  (iii) Error of law;  (b) The convicted person, or the Prosecutor on that person's behalf, may make an appeal on any of the  following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact,  (iii) Error of law, or  (iv) Any other ground that affects the fairness or reliability of the proceedings or decision. 2. (a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 (a) and (b), execution of the decision or sentence shall be suspended  during the period allowed for appeal and for the duration of the appeal proceedings.

Either party may appeal any of the following decisions in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence:  (a) A decision with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility;  (b) A decision granting or denying release of the person being investigated or prosecuted;  (c) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under article 56, paragraph 3;  (d) A decision that involves an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of  the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and for which, in the opinion of the Pre-Trial or Trial  Chamber, an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.<br/><br/>40 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3. If in an appeal against sentence the Appeals Chamber finds that the sentence is disproportionate to the  crime, it may vary the sentence in accordance with Part 7.  4. The judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall be taken by a majority of the judges and shall be delivered  in open court. The judgement shall state the reasons on which it is based. When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at the time of the  accused's death who has been given express written instructions from the accused to bring such a claim, or  the Prosecutor on the person's behalf, may apply to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of  conviction or sentence on the grounds that:  (a) New evidence has been discovered that:  (i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially  attributable to the party making application; and  (ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have  resulted in a different verdict; (b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the  conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;  (c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has  committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to  justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46. 2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Requests for cooperation and any documents supporting the request shall either be in or be accompanied by  a translation into an official language of the requested State or one of the working languages of the Court,  in accordance with the choice made by that State upon ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.  Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part. Article 89   Surrender of persons to the Court 1.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

The Court shall have the authority to provide an assurance to a witness or an expert appearing before the  Court that he or she will not be prosecuted, detained or subjected to any restriction of personal freedom by  the Court in respect of any act or omission that preceded the departure of that person from the requested  State. <br/><br/>46 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3. Where execution of a particular measure of assistance detailed in a request presented under paragraph  1, is prohibited in the requested State on the basis of an existing fundamental legal principle of general  application, the requested State shall promptly consult with the Court to try to resolve the matter. In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

(a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.  (b) Where, however, the request from the Court concerns information, property or persons which are  subject to the control of a third State or an international organization by virtue of an international  agreement, the requested States shall so inform the Court and the Court shall direct its request to the  third State or international organization.  10. (a) The Court may, upon request, cooperate with and provide assistance to a State Party conducting an  investigation into or trial in respect of conduct which constitutes a crime within the jurisdiction of the  Court or which constitutes a serious crime under the national law of the requesting State.  (b) (i) The assistance provided under subparagraph (a) shall include, inter alia :   a. The transmission of statements, documents or other types of evidence obtained in the    course of an investigation or a trial conducted by the Court; and   b.

If the documents or other types of evidence have been obtained with the assistance of a    State, such transmission shall require the consent of that State;   b. If the statements, documents or other types of evidence have been provided by a witness     or expert, such transmission shall be subject to the provisions of article 68. (c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j). Article 95   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of an admissibility challenge Where there is an admissibility challenge under consideration by the Court pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  requested State may postpone the execution of a request under this Part pending a determination by the Court,  unless the Court has specifically ordered that the Prosecutor may pursue the collection of such evidence pursuant  to article 18 or 19. Article 96   Contents of request for other forms of assistance under article 93 1. A request for other forms of assistance referred to in article 93 shall be made in writing. In urgent cases, a  request may be made by any medium capable of delivering a written record, provided that the request shall  be confirmed through the channel provided for in article 87, paragraph 1 (a).  2. The request shall, as applicable, contain or be supported by the following:  (a) A concise statement of the purpose of the request and the assistance sought, including the legal basis  and the grounds for the request;  (b) As much detailed information as possible about the location or identification of any person or place  that must be found or identified in order for the assistance sought to be provided;  (c) A concise statement of the essential facts underlying the request;  (d) The reasons for and details of any procedure or requirement to be followed;  (e) Such information as may be required under the law of the requested State in order to execute the  request; and  (f) Any other information relevant in order for the assistance sought to be provided. 3. Upon the request of the Court, a State Party shall consult with the Court, either generally or with respect to  a specific matter, regarding any requirements under its national law that may apply under paragraph 2 (e).  During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/><br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a  sentence of imprisonment shall be borne by the Court.  Article 104   Change in designation of State of enforcement 1. The Court may, at any time, decide to transfer a sentenced person to a prison of another State.  2. A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

<p>
  When Luiz Inácio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on.
 </p>
<p>
  While investigations prove that a considerable part of the High Command of the Armed Forces and senior officials, even in minority, mobilized to consummate the military coup, president Luiz Inácio reiterated his guidance: not to promote acts or events condemning the 60th anniversary of the coup of 1964.
 </p>
<p>
  To prove the error of this government policy, it would be enough to mention how the reactionary sectors of the ruling classes received it. Representing the military right, the ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mourão had no doubts: “He’s right, that’s the past,” he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Estadão [newspaper], used to criticizing Luiz Inácio, was quick to defend him: “Lula acts correctly” by refusing to talk about the 1964 coup in its 60 years, in line with “an imperative of governability in a context of wounds waiting to heal” and “it is also a way of honoring the current military command, also architect of pacification”, he stated in the editorial “Lula’s accommodation with the military” (March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estadão, which has already advocated for the government to reopen the Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances (CEMDP), something that Luiz Inácio refuses to do, capitulates by echoing this government’s cowardly complicity.
 </p>
<p>
  Only the reactionary ideologues – committed above all to the continued exploitation of the people and the Nation – and the opportunists, whose mentality has been emasculated by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of the popular masses, believe that appeasement will lead to the stabilization of the country.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the results of the elections (2018) by taking away Luiz Inácio from the race, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote on that candidate in the Supreme Court.
  </p>
<p>
   As we see: long before Bolsonaro took the presidency – and independently of him – the latent wound of the coup was again manifesting itself acutely, especially because it had not been properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with the gorillas and transition with the Amnesty military regime of General and Unrestricted Amnesty, led in which there was no punishment, no change in the high military officials, nor in the training curriculums, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which they followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as “democratic revolution”, and when it was removed from the front of management of the old State, it took back the belief that the Armed Forces were the Moderating Power and guarantors of the “Democratic State of Law” – and, therefore, also guarantors of its restriction or even suspension, as Bolsonaro shamelessly tried to do.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    When Luiz Inácio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on. When the masses rise up in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, the gorillas, as the Moderating Power they believe in, will rise again threatening the Country with military intervention to save the Nation from “disintegration”. Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and weakened, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup escalation.
   </p>
<p>
    Appeasement with the military leadership only feeds the coup!
   </p>
<p>
    For genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, as well as the popular masses in struggle, there is no other path left than to forcefully raise the campaign to denounce the 60 years of the ignominious coup of 1964 and the coup, whether in the form of institutional rupture or in the form of “Moderating Power”. Compromises with fascists and coup plotters are not acceptable – which would only lead us to coup and fascism.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 15 ter6  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (Security Council referral) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraph  (b), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 5. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/><br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/><br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Article 65   Proceedings on an admission of guilt 1. Where the accused makes an admission of guilt pursuant to article 64, paragraph 8 (a), the Trial Chamber  shall determine whether:  (a) The accused understands the nature and consequences of the admission of guilt;  (b) The admission is voluntarily made by the accused after sufficient consultation with defence counsel;  and  (c) The admission of guilt is supported by the facts of the case that are contained in:  (i) The charges brought by the Prosecutor and admitted by the accused;  (ii) Any materials presented by the Prosecutor which supplement the charges and which the  accused accepts; and  (iii) Any other evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses, presented by the Prosecutor or the  accused. 2. Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

(a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State.

Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/><br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall, as appropriate, apply to requests from States Parties to the Court. In  that case, the Court shall bear the ordinary costs of execution.  Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.  Article 102   Use of terms For the purposes of this Statute:  (a) "surrender" means the delivering up of a person by a State to the Court, pursuant to this Statute.  (b) "extradition" means the delivering up of a person by one State to another as provided by treaty,  convention or national legislation.<br/><br/>50 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 10.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4. If no State is designated under paragraph 1, the sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a prison  facility made available by the host State, in accordance with the conditions set out in the headquarters  agreement referred to in article 3, paragraph 2. In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a  sentence of imprisonment shall be borne by the Court.  Article 104   Change in designation of State of enforcement 1.

A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

The sweeping away of the old world brings the flags of tomorrow: socialist Catalonia federated in the Spanish Socialist Republic with the red flag of communism in the center.

<p>
  The President of the Generality, Pere Aragonès, announced last Wednesday, March 13, that the regional elections were expedited to May 12. What should be the opinion of the revolutionaries on this matter? With this opinion article we aim to clarify some fundamental questions.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   The parties of the Catalan bourgeoisie have betrayed the Catalan proletariat and people again and again
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The torrent of mobilization and fury of the Catalan national liberation movement, whose qualitative leap we saw on October 1, 2017 with the holding of the referendum declared illegal by the Spanish State – and its subsequent repression – has led to nothing. We must learn a lesson from what happened.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   “Thank goodness ours govern and not the PP and Vox” they say in the TV3 gatherings. The reality is that ERC, Junts and PSC govern exactly the same as PSOE, PP and Vox. The Catalan bourgeois politicians are class enemies of the proletariat and enemies of the people. They seek independence only for their economic interests, they do not hesitate to crush the proletariat and they absolutely do not care about the Catalan language and culture.
  </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
    The national liberation movement at the crossroads:
   </strong>
<br>
<strong>
    follow the bourgeois path or the proletarian path?
   </strong>
</br></h2>
<p>
   There are two paths in the Catalan national liberation movement: the bourgeois path and the proletarian path. The two paths are completely different in class interests, method and objectives.
  </p>
<p>
   The bourgeois path serves the Catalan bourgeoisie, which seeks the independence of Catalonia from the Spanish State to become imperialist itself, continue oppressing its own people and take the leap to oppress other peoples in the world. The bourgeois path keeps the proletariat and the people in poverty, as it has done for centuries. Increase in prices and increase in the CPI, labor exploitation, increase in rents, evictions and police violence, etc. The Catalan bourgeois politicians in Barcelona have governed in the same way as the Spanish bourgeois politicians in Madrid. The bourgeois path urges the masses to participate in the electoral farce, seeking to extinguish the people’s desire for democratic rights and freedoms and spreads racism and chauvinism against the people (both the Spanish people and the oppressed nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia).
  </p>
<p p="">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
     Boycott the electoral farce!

    During the last few years, revisionists and opportunists of all kinds have called on the masses to participate in the electoral farce, to voice their political demands in parliament and to continue down the bourgeois path. The bourgeois path only serves the bourgeoisie. You cannot change the bourgeois State from within, you cannot change a machine of oppression from within. Much less can independence be achieved by participating within the institutions of the Spanish State (Generality, Provincial Councils, City Councils, …) and being part of it.
   </p>
<p>
    In an article published in Servir al Pueblo, it was explained, in a summarized way, why to apply the boycott. We reproduce it in full:
   </p>
<p>
    “
    <em>
     1. Why to boycott the elections?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because we chose the revolutionary path and socialism, the power of the working class against the bourgeoisie. The participation in the elections, directly or not directly, has nothing to do with the path to the socialism (proletarian revolution).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because the elections inside the Bourgeois State are a farce. This is the reason that we call them electoral farce or electoral farce of the bourgeoisie. There are not a farce because are rigged, but because don’t matter what you are gonna vote: there is no any democracy. All the really important decisions, absolutely all of them, are being decided in other ways and not in the parliamentary one.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because with the elections we chose the government, but not the State or the ruling class. The turn government is just the administrator of the interests of the financial oligarchy, the imperialist bourgeoisie, which is the ruler of the Spanish State. There is no substantial difference between all the governments of the Bourgeois democracy in the recent history (approximately, since 1975).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     2. Why to vote is useless to stop fascism?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because the recent fascistization of the State (more presence on the streets and in the mass media of fascist parties/organizations, more influence of reactionary ideas, etc…) is the logic consequence of the militarization of the Spanish State. Since 1980, as approximate date, the States began to militarize themselves. Inside the plan of militarization of the Spanish State, the fascistization is a consequence of this. Therefore, a bigger presence of the fascism is not because of a electoral success. Is quite the opposite: the electoral success of reactionary forces and fascists is because of the fascism and the reaction being more present in the society, consequence of this militarization and fascistization of the States (and, in this case, of the Spanish State).
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – There will be not more or less repression to the working class movement depending on the turn government, or at least, because of the decision of the party in the government. In other words, the bigger or smaller repression is because of the plans of the financial oligarchy, and not because of the plans of the bourgeois leader of turn. During the last years of progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, we have suffered repression in the general strike of the metal in Cadiz and Vigo; the imprisonment of the political prisoner Pablo Hasel; there have not repeal the “Ley Mordaza” [Translator’s note: the main repressive law in Spanish State, which the social-democrats promised to repeal]; they have been committed the genocide against the African masses in Melilla; they have committed thousands and thousands of evictions; they have infiltrated national policemen inside the social and political movements, etc.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     3. Why is useless to vote the less bad option?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     – Because the less bad option is not any option. Vote to PP, PSOE, Vox or Sumar doesn’t change anything, all of them are administrators of the financial capital. None of the parties of the parliament challenge nor the bourgeois order, neither the Spanish imperialist. During the last years of the progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, the life conditions of the working class became worst in all the aspects. We are gonna reward the administrators of the financial capital voting them again with the excuse of “stop the fascism” to allow them to worsen our life in the next years?
    </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
     –
    </em>
<em>
     Because vote the less bad option doesn’t protect civil, social or trade-unionist rights. Which rights we have recovered with the progresist government of coalitin between PSOE and Unidas Podemos? They have break up the union movement and have repressed the movements of the combative masses. The prices are increasing much more than wages. The alleged winning of rights for the proletarian woman and the LGTB collective is a ghost in a paper, meanwhile the hate crimes non stop their increase. What have done the government for the proletariat?”

     The Catalan proletariat must
    </strong>
<strong>
     struggle
    </strong>
<strong>
     side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat
    </strong>
</h2>
<p>
    The Catalan proletariat will be completely free not only when its national rights are respected, but when it is liberated as a social class. And that involves the destruction of the Spanish imperialist State, the old bourgeois State, and the generation of a new power, the new proletarian State. The Catalan proletariat cannot fight alone against the Spanish imperialist State. It must fight side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat as class brothers against the common enemy: the Spanish State, Spanish imperialism.
   </p>
<p>
    This titanic task involves the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Spain as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, mainly Maoist, Party with the universally valid contributions of Chairman Gonzalo. A militarized Party prepared to take political power with People’s War and with the perspective of shaping the dictatorship of the proletariat as a federal Socialist Republic where the proletariat of all nations struggle, as class brothers and ultimately, until communism.
   </p>
<p>
    Thus, and only thus, the Catalan proletariat will be free. And the first step cannot be other than delegitimate the electoral farce, discard illusions in bourgeois democracy and preparing for the battles that will come in the struggle against the Spanish State.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 5. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/><br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/><br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected.

The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

The Trial Chamber shall ensure that a complete record of the trial, which accurately reflects the proceedings,  is made and that it is maintained and preserved by the Registrar.  Article 65   Proceedings on an admission of guilt 1. Where the accused makes an admission of guilt pursuant to article 64, paragraph 8 (a), the Trial Chamber  shall determine whether:  (a) The accused understands the nature and consequences of the admission of guilt;  (b) The admission is voluntarily made by the accused after sufficient consultation with defence counsel;  and  (c) The admission of guilt is supported by the facts of the case that are contained in:  (i) The charges brought by the Prosecutor and admitted by the accused;  (ii) Any materials presented by the Prosecutor which supplement the charges and which the  accused accepts; and  (iii) Any other evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses, presented by the Prosecutor or the  accused. 2. Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2.

The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances.

If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at the time of the  accused's death who has been given express written instructions from the accused to bring such a claim, or  the Prosecutor on the person's behalf, may apply to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of  conviction or sentence on the grounds that:  (a) New evidence has been discovered that:  (i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially  attributable to the party making application; and  (ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have  resulted in a different verdict; (b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the  conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;  (c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has  committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to  justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46. 2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

If the statements, documents or other types of evidence have been provided by a witness     or expert, such transmission shall be subject to the provisions of article 68. (c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j). Article 95   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of an admissibility challenge Where there is an admissibility challenge under consideration by the Court pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  requested State may postpone the execution of a request under this Part pending a determination by the Court,  unless the Court has specifically ordered that the Prosecutor may pursue the collection of such evidence pursuant  to article 18 or 19. Article 96   Contents of request for other forms of assistance under article 93 1. A request for other forms of assistance referred to in article 93 shall be made in writing. In urgent cases, a  request may be made by any medium capable of delivering a written record, provided that the request shall  be confirmed through the channel provided for in article 87, paragraph 1 (a).  2. The request shall, as applicable, contain or be supported by the following:  (a) A concise statement of the purpose of the request and the assistance sought, including the legal basis  and the grounds for the request;  (b) As much detailed information as possible about the location or identification of any person or place  that must be found or identified in order for the assistance sought to be provided;  (c) A concise statement of the essential facts underlying the request;  (d) The reasons for and details of any procedure or requirement to be followed;  (e) Such information as may be required under the law of the requested State in order to execute the  request; and  (f) Any other information relevant in order for the assistance sought to be provided. 3. Upon the request of the Court, a State Party shall consult with the Court, either generally or with respect to  a specific matter, regarding any requirements under its national law that may apply under paragraph 2 (e).  During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/><br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.  Article 102   Use of terms For the purposes of this Statute:  (a) "surrender" means the delivering up of a person by a State to the Court, pursuant to this Statute.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4. If no State is designated under paragraph 1, the sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a prison  facility made available by the host State, in accordance with the conditions set out in the headquarters  agreement referred to in article 3, paragraph 2. In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a  sentence of imprisonment shall be borne by the Court.  Article 104   Change in designation of State of enforcement 1. The Court may, at any time, decide to transfer a sentenced person to a prison of another State.  2. A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  Representatives of the peasant families who recently occupied Fazenda Ipê, in Machadinho D'Oeste, northeastern Rondônia, denounced a brutal attack on camp, promoted by a band of paramilitary and police, on March 7, 2024.
 </p>
<p>
  The camps were surprised by several men without uniforms who invaded the camp through the woods. The paramilitary pack raised, beat the workers and handed them to police officers waiting for a soybean area with several vehicles and even a helicopter. The peasants thought they would be imprisoned, but suffered a new session of physical aggression, this time by the police; Only a camp was taken arrested.
 </p>
<p>
  The helicopter was probably the same one that acted in the Machadinho region, since 03/05, was linked to the Federal Police, as you can see in the video:

<p>
  Peasant representatives suspect that one of the principals of this crime is the “IVO da Ipê” landowner, which is said to the owner of Fazenda Ipê - public lands for land reform - caught by his father -in -law, already deceased, owner of the Ipê logger , in Jaru.
 </p>
<p>
  “Ivo do Ipê” is a former peasant enemy, responsible for the murder of peasant Ivo Martins, from the Cristo Rei area, in Cacaulândia, according to complaints made by leaders of the Land struggle to the Ministry of Agrarian Development in February 2003. Peasants also also It is responsible for the cowardly murders of companions Tonha and Serafim, on August 1, 2003. They were leaders of various camps in the Machadinho region and were victims of an ambush, when they returned from an Incrade Ariquemes, marked by emergency by the agency federal.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  New case of repression of the just struggle for land
 </h3>
<p>
  This new attack on peasants, in early March, adds to several others in the region, promoted by a far -right landowner consortium that has acted with paramilitary groups in conjunction with Old State official troops.
 </p>
<p>
  On February 28, a police helicopter had flew over several areas of struggle for the land in Machadinho. Peasants of at least 3 localities reported the flyfish of this aircraft, which left the municipality early and only returned to the late afternoon. Peasant leaders in the region fear that this is part of some joint planning between landowners and police for a wave of repression of peasants in struggle for the right to land.
 </p>
<p>
  Last week, peasants in the wall, on the RO-237 highway, also in Machadinho, gathered to prepare the resistance against a new eviction order, unjustly issued by the judiciary. Public Land, has a Federal Justice Order to remove the farmer since 2012 - for that they have never come, to remove the peasants, they have poured about 3 times.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘We will not leave our lands!’
 </h3>
<p>
  On the other hand, organized peasants reaffirm their decision to resist their land and prepare each other more and more united, organized and combative.

  Throughout the auditorium, the flags of the organization adorned the flags and banners with slogons about the struggle for the redistribution of land. Right at the access road hung a banner »
  <strong>
   Out with the earthenwork! For titulation of our belongings!
  </strong>
  "The tone struck the event. Inside the auditorium there were other banners who condemned soil deprivations, mining on a large scale and called for peasant unit. The signatures came from occupiers from various communities such as Gleba Campina, Povoado Vilela, Caranandeua and Jaraquara communities and the peasant association Povoado de Maracacuera in Carutapera Municipality.

<strong>
   The country
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   March 21, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Filipino people are burning with rage at the US-Marcos regime over its all-out fascist oppression throughout the country, especially in the countryside. The peasant masses are outraged that amidst widespread misery and hunger, the reactionary regime is intent on fascism and land grabbing.
 </p>
<p>
  Desperate to “finish off” the revolutionary armed resistance of the Filipino people, the US-Marcos regime’s armed tentacles is carrying out a rampant terrorist and fascist rampage throughout the country. Marcos and the AFP are set to make one false declaration after another that provinces have become “insurgency-free,” especially in areas that have long been targets of foreign corporations for mining, plantation and energy projects. At the behest of US imperialism, the AFP is also in a hurry to “end” the armed struggle of the Filipino people so that the US military can fully employ the AFP in its war of provocation against China which is likely to intensify in the coming year.
 </p>
<p>
  Marcos and the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) have recently ordered an all-out war. The declared aim of this war is to dismantle all NPA guerrilla fronts by the end of March, destroy all NPA combat units by the end of June, and destroy all regional Party committees before the end of the year. Thousands of military troops, alongside police combat troops and tens of thousands of paramilitaries armed by the AFP, have been dispatched to ravage the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of villages are being garrisoned by Marcos’ fascist minions. Oppressive soldiers are controlling people’s lives and livelihoods, silencing them and trampling on their rights and freedoms. Checkpoints and food blockades, prohibiting people from working in their fields or swidden farms, armed soldiers occupying barangay centers, going house to house and forcing people to “surrender,” harassing young women or even married women, all-night drinking, beatings and altercations, indiscriminate firing of guns—this is how people perceive the rotten soldiers. Amid drought and disasters, fascist soldiers are like pests who bring nothing but disaster to their communities.
 </p>
<p>
  Using powerful weapons such as drones and jet fighters, helicopters and howitzers, Marcos’s terrorist soldiers are bombing mountains and fields, indiscriminately firing night or day, destroying the forests and poisoning waters, shattering the peace and causing deep trauma to the people, especially children, pregnant women and the elderly. These result in unnecessary number of lives lost, contrary to all principles and laws of civilized warfare.
 </p>
<p>
  The evil aim of Marcos is to instill fear in the hearts of the people and force them prostrate while allowing their land to be grabbed by big foreign capitalists and their partner comprador bourgeoisie and big landlords. But instead of falling on the ground, the people are more and more roused to stand up and fight, and tread the path of armed revolution.
 </p>
<p>
  In the guerrilla fronts across the country, the units of the New People’s Army (NPA) continue to enjoy deep and widespread support from the peasant masses. Military officers of the AFP and the reactionary state are furious that despite their intensified all-out war which has lasted for almost seven years, the peasant masses continue to provide political and material support to the Red fighters. Young farmers, as well as young students, workers, as well as professionals continue to join the people’s army.
 </p>
<p>
  The people’s desire to carry forward the armed struggle continues to burn. Amid fascist attacks perpetrated by the armed minions of the US-Marcos regime, and oppressive policies that worsen their plight, it is becoming clearer to the minds and consciousness of the peasant masses that they completely have nothing if they do not have the New People’s Army on their side to defend their lives and rights, and to fight with for their land and livelihood.
 </p>
<p>
  In recent years, the NPA has suffered losses and setbacks in various parts of the country due to the errors and weaknesses of conservatism and complacency with its previous accomplishments. Instead of boldly treading the path of continuous expansion and invigoration of the armed struggle, the scope and mass base of guerrilla units were reduced, and units became passive and vulnerable to enemy encirclement. Under the guidance of and inspired by the Party, the NPA is determined to rectify errors and move forward on the path of strengthening and galvanizing the people’s war.
 </p>
<p>
  In the spirit of the rectification movement, the NPA must more vigorously wage armed struggle in all parts of the country. Utilizing the broad mass movement in guerrilla warfare, they must use all weapons—guns and rocks, spears and punji traps, shotguns and landmines—and carry out large or small tactical offensives that can be won against weak and isolated parts of the enemy. Strike at the enemy’s fascist troops and all its tentacles by way of rendering justice for the people and inspiring their resistance. Only by waging widespread armed resistance can the NPA consolidate, overcome setbacks and strengthen.
 </p>
<p>
  Since its establishment, five and a half decades ago, the NPA has served as the true people’s army in promoting the revolutionary aspirations of the Filipino people for national democracy. On its coming anniversary on March 29, let us celebrate its accomplishments for the past 55 years, pay tribute to all the martyrs and heroes, and reaffirm the determination to advance the protracted people’s war, without fear of sacrifices and hardships, to achieve ultimate victory in the future.

      From 
 This experience that Marx theorizes the need for dictatorship of 
 proletariat
     </b>
     . The proletariat cannot only take power, 
 To keep it, he must exercise a dictatorship towards the bourgeoisie who 
 he defeated, otherwise the bourgeoisie organizes himself and resumes his own 
 candies. And precisely from the great lessons of this short but intense 
 first experience of the proletariat who was born the need for 
 dictatorship of the proletariat.

     Another one 
 important lesson that Marx and Engels draw is the problem of 
 State.
     <b>
      The bourgeois state is not enough to take it from the class 
 worker in his own hands and transform it, but it must be reversed and 
 build a new state, totally different, compared to the principles, 
 to the class it represents. And the Municipality began to do this.

     For 
 The revolutionary communists, for the avant -garde workers the Municipality 
 It must be more alive than ever. This great first experience of the 
 working class provides theoretical, political, ideological lessons, e 
 practices that show that
     <b>
      The proletariat has only one solution 
 conquest of political power with the revolution,
     </b>
     and that with 
 power in his own hands the proletariat with his "decrees" 
 addresses and solves fundamental problems of the masses in a few days 
 which today seem unresolved.

<p>
   Ready for war." This is what the German army is should become 
again. For this, the Ministry of Defense, which reports to the german 
defense minister Boris Pistorius, has now presented a concept paper as a
 proposal in which initial measures are set out to drive forward in the 
rearmament of the german military
  </p>
<p>
   The document is entitled "Bundeswehr of the Future". Bundeswehr is 
the name of the german military. The document lists various points that 
need to be implemented in order to make the German army "fit for war" 
again. One of these points is the strengthening of the military 
branches. Military branches are a part of the armed forces divided into 
various specialized areas. In Germany, the military comprises three 
branches. The army, navy and air force. In the future, however, there 
will also be a fourth branch of the armed forces, which concerns the 
area of "cyber and information space".
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, there will also be restructuring in the command of 
operations aimed at strengthening centralization. An "operational 
leadership command of the Bundeswehr" is to be created in future. All 
Bundeswehr operations, whether at home or abroad, would then be 
centrally controlled and coordinated by this command.
  </p>
<p>
   Furthermore, under the motto: "The Bundeswehr as a whole must be 
geared towards an emergency", it is demanded that the Bundeswehr must be
 put in a logistical position to be able to make war at any time.
   <br>
   To
 this end, the military administration should already be planning ahead 
for "emergencies". Accordingly, requirements such as infrastructure, 
personnel, material, etc. should be identified and made available.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Even if only in passing, the document also raises the issue of 
military conscription. The document proposes structural and process 
changes, particularly in the area of personnel. The structures should 
operate "largely smoothly" and "especially in
   <br>
   situations of extreme turmoil and great coordination effort on the part of the state
   <br>
   be
 able to fold up." To this purpose, a coordination center is also to be 
created to "control the personnel growth capability". This should be in a
 position to "quickly ensure that personnel requirements are met". In 
other words, in the case of war, they conscript masses of young people 
as cannon fodder for the German bourgeoisie.
  </br></br></p>
<p>
   The creation of such a coordination office is also relevant for a 
future reintroduction of a compulsory military service. It is well known
 that the German Minister of Defense, or one could rather say Minister 
of War, Pistorius, is a vehement campaigner for the reintroduction of 
compulsory military service. In this context, it also makes sense that 
he is calling for the creation of structures that would be able to 
operate immediately after the introduction of such military 
conscription.
  </p>
<p>
   Ultimately, it can be said that the German bourgeoisie is 
increasingly calling for war.  The introduction to the above-mentioned 
document already makes it clear, that it is not about using the german 
military as a defensive army.
  </p>
<p>
   So they write:
   <br/>
   "Germany, as a globally networked nation in all 
respects, will therefore have to be able to counter threats and 
destabilization at home, in Europe and in the world at all times in the 
future. To this end, the Bundeswehr also provides politicians with 
instruments for action."
  </p>
<p>
   Even if there is always talk of "defending" Germany, it is much more 
about defending the economic interests of German imperialism with fire 
and steel all over the world against the oppressed people and 
imperialist competitors. A fact that is confirmed by germanys actual 
military operations.

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central 
Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and 
others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to
 celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit
 and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies
 upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose
 the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize 
Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the 
imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson 
for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India 
(Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical 
Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat 
Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” 
Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack 
the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, 
accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating 
exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, 
Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation 
through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged 
promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and 
socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

    In a "joint motion for decision-making" by the EU Parliament, the Austrian MPs agreed to finance 0.25 percent of GDP (around 1.17 billion euros) for war in Ukraine annually at the end of February 2024. In addition, military support from Ukraine and the further upgrade of Austria was decided. The original document states that
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "That all Member States of the EU and all allies in NATO should support Ukraine militarily with at least 0.25 % of their GDP annually (...)"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (1). NATO and EU go hand in hand as far as the enforcement of the war interests of the "western" imperialists concern - and Austria goes with it! Matthew Karnitschnig, journalist of the US policy magazine politico, formulated the NATO plans for Austria as follows:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     “Austria is a country of 'Mr. Karl' that serves all sides to commit to western ideals, while in silence it is looking for paths to continue to benefit from the friendly relationships with Moscow. (…) Today Austrian neutrality is little more than a convenient excuse to avoid responsibility (…) Austria is a free -rider of its neighbors and the USA (…) to this day. Unless the outside world forces it, either by shaping or raw violence. ”
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (2) Explanations like this let a shower pull over our backs and give an indication of what will bloom us as an EU member and "NATO partner". The ruling Austria, who largely participate in this course, see it differently. The Austrian Army Brigadier Robert Brieger, currently chairman of the EU military committee, even finds the debate about atomic armament of the EU "Legitim" (3).

    The military upgrade in the EU is aimed at "war economy". In the above-mentioned EU "decision-making application" it is stated that defense production is significantly increased and that arms production must be given priority for Ukraine. In addition, the application for a resolution asks the EU and its member states to

    While military expenses are to increase by 85 percent in the period 2022 to 2027, which is plus 2.3 billion euros, for example, health expenditure decreases by 52 percent and 2.9 billion in the same period. The savings in the healthcare system are also a result of the EU fiscal package and the EU Commission. Nick Witney, a former head of the EU armaments office, explained some time ago why the EU interferes with such questions of national budget policy:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "Few MPs want to justify their electorate why their taxes for combat helicopters should be used instead of hospitals (...) Military operations cost money and risk human life (...) Only an iron political will, underpowered, can ensure that this can ensure that this Strategic orientation against short -term inconvenience. "
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (5) These "short -term inconvenience" are now tough reality and the signs are on further deterioration. Social mining, dismantling of democratic rights and upgrade are the program of the hour that the masses are imposed by the rulers. This program requires a decisive rejection, resistance and struggle - against NATO, EU and the ruling Austria!

Description: After a first advance for the official elimination of neutrality was dropped relatively quickly about two years ago, the complete hollowing out neutrality has been practiced in rapid steps since then. In words, politicians of various strings defend neutrality, while in deeds they rarely pay attention. The restoration of neutrality becomes the demand for those who face these developments - and that is many! In February this year

    A survey was published in February of this year, according to the 51 percent of the following:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "Austria's neutrality is hollowed out"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (1). Around 80 percent are for maintaining neutrality. This means that the absolute majority of the population is against the abolition of neutrality. The adherence to the rulers practiced in words therefore plays the role of fraud and the soothing of the population. Because while reigning politicians don't want to burn their fingers, alumni are not so squeamish. The former Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik serves the platform attack on neutrality:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "Our favorite garment is the camouflage cap, which is called neutrality in this country"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (2). Former Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel (ÖVP) says:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "Neutrality does not offer any protection."
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (3) A circle (former) SPÖ diplomat that has been advising the SP boss Babler since the beginning (the so-called "initiative of democratic foreign policy") says:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "The neutrality is often exaggerated in the SPÖ"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    and speaks against
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "Nostalgic neutralism"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (4). The ORF, currently a whipping of a new start of the debate about NATO accession, propagates the platform "ours Security.org". So far, this spread two "open letters"
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "The Federal President, the Federal Government, the National Council and the population of Austria"
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    in which a debate about the abolition of neutrality is required. In addition to numerous entrepreneurs and diplomats, the supporters of this initiative also include, for example, Othmar Karas (ÖVP), Johannes Kopf (board member AMS) and various well -known faces of the SPÖ, such as Rudolf Fußi and Robert Misik. All of these examples make it clear that the formal adherence to neutrality, while at the same time, is already part of their abolition. Defense Minister Tanner formulated:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     "(...) The neutrality is not called a military alliance
    </span>
</span>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
      for the foreseeable future
     </span>
</span>
</span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     to join "
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (5). Various "interpretations" for neutrality are also on the agenda: While Tanner replaces the word "everlasting" with "for the foreseeable future", others particularly emphasize the purely "military" character of neutrality. Of course, this is of course also a pointed freezing to enforce political interests.

    In the current location, it can not only be about maintaining neutrality as a law, but also the actual compliance, i.e. the restoration of neutrality. All of the bourgeois parties are not an alternative, since they only represent different shades of a hollowing out neutrality. The task of fighting and restoring neutrality lies on the shoulders of the masses, the population. Not the ballot papers in an election, but only the active merger and struggle will bring success. The defense of neutrality today means to enforce the interests of people against those of the rulers.

  Hundreds of fighters have responded to the call of the "Thessaloniki Organizations - Colleges" and members of the Palestinian Community of Thessaloniki, to condemn and denounce the Palestinian People's Genistian People's Political Policy to the Palestinian People's People's Genocide in the Strip of Gaza. Thousands of bombs, hunger and illness. They gathered and demonstrated to denounce the Western patrons of the fascist state of Israel, the US-NATO and EU imperialists, but also the increasingly deeper involvement of our country in the slaughter in Palestine.

  Before 7pm, people began to concentrate on the statue of Venizelos, which began to fill the space. Microphone played revolutionary Palestinian songs, and the organizers' announcement was read. Particularly moving was the moment when the poem of a murdered Zionist bombs, Palestinian of Gaza, was read.

<div style="text-align: left;">
  Very encouraging was the participation of several dozen Palestinian refugees and members of the Palestinian community of Thessaloniki, which gave pulse and militancy both to the gathering and the following demonstration. This day is of particular importance to the Palestinian people as it is the memory of the Battle of Al-Karama, which took place on 21/3 of 1968, against the Zionist troops. At the same time, as it is World Day Against Racism, the organizers wanted to underline the fair struggle of the Palestinian people against the apartheid regime that has imposed the Zionist state of Israel for more than seven decades. A regime that in recent years has escalated the policy of racial divisions at the expense of Palestinians and Arabs throughout historical Palestine.

The participation with the banner of the Physicist Student Association, which continues to occupy the law on private universities by responding in practice to the recent MAT invasion of Students and the arrests of students as well as a more comprehensive effort to terrorize the student struggles, was also positive.

   Tina Modotti's life (Udine, Italy, 1896 - Mexico City, 1942) was marked by some of the most important historical events of the first half of the twentieth century: the economic emigration of the Europeans in America, the birth of silent cinema on the The western coast of the United States, the post-revolutionary agricultural movements in Mexico, the rise of political murals, the recovery of Mexican indigenous culture, the emancipation of women in the public sphere, the contrast between Stalinisti and Trotzkisti after the Russian revolution of 1917 And the Spanish civil war.

   In September 1928 he became the companion of Julio Antonio Mella, a young Cuban revolutionary, with whom Tina lives a deep love and at the side of which intensifies the work of committed photographer and political militant. In 1930 Modotti was expelled from Mexico for his communist activities. He lived for several years in the Soviet Union, where his photographic activism became activism. In the mid -thirties, the Soviet Communist Party sent it to Spain. During the civil war, he organized the evacuation of "war children", coordinated the management of military hospitals and carried out propaganda missions. After the defeat of the Republicans in 1939, he crossed the Pyrenees together with thousands of exiles. Exhausted and disillusioned by the outcome of the Spanish War, he had to leave Europe again. He died in 1942 in Mexico City.

   The country

<p>
<strong>
   March 21, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Filipino women bear the worst effects of the neo-liberal policies imposed by US imperialism and its puppet state in the past four decades. Due to policies of liberalization, deregulation and privatization, they are further marginalized to the fringes of society, where they are forced to endure informal, insecure and jobs with slave-like wages.
 </p>
<p>
  The majority of women belong to the most exploited and oppressed sectors of society—workers, farmers and indigenous people, the rural and urban poor. In the past decade, more than half of them, age 15 and older, have not been counted as part of the labor force because of the nature of the jobs they perform. Among them are the millions of housewives who engage in farm work and accept “sideline” jobs while burdened with heavy housework and childcare. In 2022, about 20 million were excluded from the labor force, unemployed and underemployed.
 </p>
<p>
  Seven out of every ten women considered employed are in the service sector. Jobs here are classified as “low-skilled” and are irregular. This is despite women’s relatively higher educational attainment.
 </p>
<p>
  In the manufacturing sector, 90% of women are “irregular” and very few (2.7%) are under unions. A significant number of women are in factories of big foreign capitalists within the export processing zones, making them part of the international assembly line (what imperialists call the global value chain). Foreigners are said to “prefer” female workers because of their docility, skill in detailed work such as assembling semiconductors or sewing, and flexibility in overtime. The truth is, these qualities are not inherent in women, but arise from desperation resulting from the acute employment crisis, which capitalists and labor agencies exploit.
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore, they are generally paid less, compared to men. In the clothing industry, for example, their wage levels are generally 17%-25% lower.
 </p>
<p>
  Manufacturing companies pay literally small change to urban poor women who they contract wholesale to perform some part of the assembly work. They are what the International Labor Organization calls “home-based” industrial workers. Some of their jobs are small-scale sewing, embroidery, assembling small household items, food manufacturing, making handicrafts and tourist decorations and others.
 </p>
<p>
  Among freelancers, women in digital jobs earn 18.4% less, compared to men. This is due to the “traditional view” that women are more suited to the type of jobs that are “less complex” such as encoding, as opposed to “more complex” and higher value-added jobs such as digital design which is said to be “more suitable” for men.
 </p>
<p>
  In agriculture, women farm workers receive 8% to 15% less wages, compared to the already meager wages of men. (Both daily wages are lower compared to the wages of service and industrial workers, and all wages are insufficient for their families’ needs.) More often than not, women (and children) are not paid because their role in production are considered “extensions of housework.”
 </p>
<p>
  To support their families, many women leave their children behind, go out of the country to work as maids, nannies and other jobs that expose them to extreme exploitation, oppression, violence, and in some cases, their deaths. In 2022, 1.10 million women (60.2%) emigrated, compared to 726,000 men (39.8%). Despite this, the average remittances of female migrant workers are lower (₱61,000) compared to men (₱126,000).
 </p>
<p>
  In rural areas, women farmers suffer widespread landlessness. A very small number (6.1%) have sole or shared ownership of land. They bear the brunt of the problem of high prices of farm inputs, low prices of produce and losses during calamities. A large majority are in debt to moneylenders and microfinance institutions, not only for production, but for the daily needs of their families.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We want to put in the center 
 Some aspects behind the mobilization for Palestine 
 which developed in our country and which collects a whole series 
 of necessity and indications compared to what is the perspective 
 international peoples to free themselves from imperialism against the 
 war plans and the imperialist war and the genocide that take place 
 in Palestine, but which also take place in other countries, where they are, e 
 Popular wars develop.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Palestine is 
 an opportunity for proletarians, for the communist forces and is part 
 of the work that we must also carry on in our country for 
 unmasking what is behind us, the inhumanity of this 
 imperialist/capitalist system that must be reduced because O 
 socialism or barbarism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Every day the 
 Palestine gives us this indication. Until where this comes 
 imperialist system that performs the worst crimes and performs them 
 daily towards the masses, towards the proletarians, towards the peoples who 
 they raise their heads.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is why today is 
 it is necessary to continue the mobilizations against the genocide of the people 
 Palestinian. And you must never lose sight of - and forget - 
 why this genocide takes place by Israel and the 
 coverage of imperialism mainly uses, but also the 
 complicity of many other imperialist countries, including ours 
 government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This genocide 
 It takes place as an response to the resistance action of 7 
 October. On October 7th he has
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 indicated the way to all peoples who 
 The only solution is to raise your head and fight with everyone 
 The means necessary for liberation from apartheid, Zionism, 
 generated by the imperialist system.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Palestinians do not 
 They are as the "beautiful souls" of the movement or parties would like 
 reformists who always want them as passive victims of the domain 
 Israeli colonial, but the great action of October 7 of the forces 
 of the Resistance has put the use of violence by the party at the center 
 of the oppressed, of the colonized, in their struggle for theirs 
 Liberation against the oppressors. And this is frightening to all 
 governments and imperialist bourgeois in the world.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So there is a 
 link between resistance and imperialist war, within a 
 International context of crisis of imperialism and its 
 attempt to get out through the interimperialist wars, while i 
 oppressed peoples, the exploited, the proletarians, the workers do not have 
 nothing to lose that their chains and organize their war of 
 people to wipe out governments, imperialist states at the service of 
 profits of the masters.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When peoples 
 they break the monopoly of the violence of the bourgeoisie, this is afraid 
 Because the spectrum of its end is agitated as a parasitic class.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We, in this 
 General, international context, and within our country, 
 We have to do our part of communists. Particularly in ours 
 country, in the perspective that the example of the Palestinian resistance is 
 The resistance that also serves here in Italy. Palestine is 
 The example of the peoples who fight. The liberation of the people 
 Palestinian is the liberation of all the oppressed. We have to go down 
 in the square with this spirit, bring it to the mobilizations to tie 
 solidarity to the Palestinian people, to the fight against those who all 
 days it does not give us guarantees: to workers, the work, to young people 
 of the future, to students only school-schools.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are in 
 means of this movement of Palestine to bring us the 
 our contribution, our proposals for this struggle to become 
 more and more effective and becomes more and more a political struggle against 
 The fascist government Meloni, against today's business committee 
 of the imperialist bourgeoisie who is doing business and is an accomplice 
 with weapons and is an active accomplice of the genocide and is one of the 
 Greater sponsors of Netanyahu and the fascist/Nazisionist government 
 Israeli.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this they are 
 Solidarity committees for Palestine necessary, in which the 
 Palestine support forces must join the committees and the 
 Palestinian associations on the path of internamentalism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Just as it is 
 Also in the center also the battle for a delegation 
 international that starts those who are also the 
 Responsibility of imperialist governments, such as the Italian one.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These words 
 phase order are necessary after the mobilization of 23 and 24 
 February at national level: the strike day of the 23rd who has 
 seen a part of workers take the field, particularly in the 
 logistics alongside Palestinian solidarity and the day of 
 24 with a large event in Milan compacting a part 
 of the forces that define themselves in communist, antimperialist, classy, 
 solidarity with the struggle and resistance of the Palestinian people, without 
 if and without but.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

  Of all this 
 perhaps the Meloni government is more aware of it than in these weeks 
 It is no coincidence that after these initiatives of 23 and 24, he replies by raising the 
 level of repression, how the leaf frame has happened 
 with which one would like to define terrorist who struggles for liberation 
 of their people: Anan, Mansur, Ali, is a precise message that the 
 government wants to send to intimidate all the forces of the Palestinians e 
 of the solidarity that have mobilized.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But there 
 they will be able to extend and be more and more 
 incisive in work, in every place, in every city where we are 
 present, because there are increasingly appropriate mobilizations to 
 These developments. This is what we are doing, even in the 
 Specific reality of Bergamo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One of 
 main issues is to return to the factories, it is that 
 to return to the workers to make them deploy, to make him take 
 position, to actually take the field, to try to 
 explain the link between Palestine/War/Government, because the 
 Palestine resistance is our best ally against one 
 war that returns home and that is generating a regime of 
 modern fascism, of repression, of increase in the deaths at work, of 
 not satisfaction of any need of the masses, health, of 
 work, of the future and perspective. Only war.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fact ours 
 Government is at war in the Red Sea against the people 
 Palestinian. For this we support and operate because the 
 initiatives, direct actions of reporting, mobilization against 
 university and their ties with Israel, against factories such as the 
 Leonardo or many others that in Italy produce weapons that are given 
 To carry out the massacre in Palestine, against a fascist government that 
 prohibits the manifestations and passes out to be in defense of the semutes, 
 Just him who represents the black thread of this country. To the government 
 In Italy there are the friends of the Nazis, those who say that the 
 Jews must be put to the stake and want to silence the movement 
 of the struggle of the Palestinians. Today in Italy there is a government that pushes 
 to war, to the imperialist war, for the interests of the great 
 weapons and all that is connected with the clash 
 cheap in place worldwide: oil and gas.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There is not only the 
 Leonardo, there is Eni, there is the Tenaris Dalmine who provides the pipes 
 To pierce in front of Gaza and take away oil to the Palestinians e 
 give it to the Israelis. These are all connivances that must be 
 reported and broken.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are part 
 of all the oppressed peoples, of the proletarians who want to build the 
 their right war to end it with these unjust wars, with 
 These wars that enrich few for profit and lead us 
 misery, exploitation, fascism and repression in 
 All countries in which they are present.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The best help 
 To the Palestinian people is to hit our government and everyone 
 his dirty interests, of the masters of the multinationals of 
 arms factories, but also to contrast the lies of lies of the 
 press, of the alleged media, of the whole apparatus of the State and the 
 its institutions that want to do nothing but equate the struggle 
 of Palestinians as as anti -Semitic, when in reality they are 
 making a new holocaust, because this imperialist system is 
 founded on the abuse of human dignity, on cancellation 
 of the rights of the peoples, on the cancellation of the rights of 
 workers and their lives to always keep them in slavery.

  Along with the other changes that the Ministry of Education brings this year, it is planning to make the management of absences more strictly and impose stricter penalties for what the Ministry naturally defines as a "infringement"! It plans to impose financial and criminal responsibility on students who are involved in occupations and their parents!
 </p>
<p>
  The aim of the ministry is to terrorize parents and students and to suppress the student struggles. This move is the continuation of a series of terrorism and repression measures that have implemented in the past, such as police raids in schools, telecommunications and continuous terrorism from the addresses for the potential consequences after an occupation, abstinence, or abstinence, or abstinence, or abstinence Any other act is opposed to the climate of discipline the ministry wants. Measures that implemented directly to break squats, and sometimes it didn't even take it since only the threat of their implementation was sufficient.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   They make the penalties stricter in the penalties and tighten the absences by restoring the 50 unjustified and 50 justified, in order to terrorize students for the penalties that will wait for them! So all these terrorism measures the ministry passes because it is afraid of student struggles! And he is scared because he knows what they can do!
  </p>
<p>
   So we must not let any of the new measures pass. We have to fight and overthrow them. Neither a national diploma, nor private universities, nor penalties! We have to organize with assemblies, squats! With our struggles we can overturn all the measures that are aimed at terrorizing us, but overall and overthrow the black future they are preparing!

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The economic press of yesterday's newspapers reported that to 
 Unilever Group of 59.6 billion, the new management to conquer 
 the trust of investors and recover profit margins, has 
 declared the intention to slide the ice cream section, a sector 
 seasonal and with a more complex logistics. And to prepare a 
 7500 jobs cut.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In its 
 simplicity this political economic news opens up to a great 
 truth that today is useful to return to the fact that interests 
 of the masters are antagonists, irreconcilable to those of the workers, 
 of all proletarians. Simplicity of course does not mean trivial, 
 We can see it if from another point of view we observe the state 
 of the working class today.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Individualism 
 does enormous damage into factories, a way of being and thinking 
 that the workers have absorbed and that leads to say: “The struggle puts 
 At risk the workplace or mortgage, I have to think about mine 
 situation".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is life 
 In the capitalist society that is at risk, that should 
 scare. We die of profit, poverty, for racism. There is not 
 a sector, an aspect of life, working, social, cultural, 
 that the popular masses cross, that it is saved, that it is not hard, a 
 frightening risk or under attack of the reaction. And today still 
 more in the general trend to a global enlargement of conflicts 
 with the enemy of our house, imperialist and modern fascist, 
 Meloni government, which drags us every day that passes into these 
 wars.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In statistics 
 For poverty, workers who do not do 
 they do more to reach
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 the end of the month. The increase in prices is 
 certified especially in the food sector. It is spent more and 
 A quantity of minor expenditure takes home, and these cuts, which 
 They are real privations, the proletarians make them heavily 
 also on one's health.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Cuts, 
 privatization, increase in costs, structures under organic, when 
 they are not closed, they make you sick, they make you die for lack of 
 prevention, of care. And what to say about 
 House, work, social services, school?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this is 
 closely connected to the factory, how the class acts e 
 reacts in the great factories, to the need for political work 
 in factories.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In factory today 
 Bourgeois ideology submits workers to production 
 capitalist, he makes them "stay in his own shell", to use the 
 Words of a worker. How do you feel different from others if you talk about 
 politics, war, investments in government bonds up to 
 € 50,000, which were excluded from the ISEE by the new government, if 
 Do proposals look at you like an alien.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “Everything here 
 added you are still well " - it is said - the salary and the place 
 fixed they produced a poisoned fruit. Each for themselves and everyone 
 We pay, submitted to the living and work conditions imposed by 
 capitalist system that has its center in large factories. 
 Factories where the response level is low, even to attacks 
 directed to working conditions, in the salary, instead of work, 
 to health and safety, union rights, the plans of 
 renovation or relocation that touch all aspects.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Accomplice 
 the absence of a confederal opposition union movement, the 
 his action is of control over workers instead of challenging their interests. Action that overall 
 feeds the subordination and passivity of the workers. I'm a 
 example of this the trade union agreements that bind the salary and the 
 productivity, and often also safety, to the promotion of funds 
 supplementary for pensions and healthcare rather than the defense of services 
 public, disputes on words of renounced and confined orders 
 to the single factory. And clearly, even more, the absence of 
 Activities against the government, against war, for Palestine.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   On the one hand, 
 Therefore, an ideological bombardment that attacks the 
 working class.
  </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   On the other the 
 class forces, revolutionary, today small but with only one 
 Alternative: bring with revolutionary optimism
  </b>
  work 
 necessary towards workers so that the factories must and can 
 return to being a center of socialization and organization of 
 class, through the political struggle to subtract the working class 
 to the influence of bourgeois ideology, in perspective 
 revolutionary, in the perspective of the reconstruction of the party 
 Communist.

  An instrument of 
 This work is the counter -information rossusaia which now comes out how 
 Online and weekly newspaper, printed and spread to the concierge. 
 In the current situation, in which the forces are limited, the militants 
 They are few, this means in concrete terms 
 to the workers the general political situation, the situation of all 
 the classes of the population, the situation of the movements that yes 
 translates into knowledge for the workers of what really happens, to make it food of class political consciousness. And among these, 
 As he also remembered in the first part of the counter -information of 
 Today, today there is solidarity alongside the Resistance 
 Palestinian who cannot be missing in the activity towards the workers, who 
 must not submit to the backward part, perhaps to earn a 
 easy mass consensus, that is, without breaking with positions 
 current.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Other 
 Indispensable instrument is the workers' training, training 
 ideological to fight against the dominance of bourgeois ideology 
 inside the class, as we have seen, against the cult of the 
 spontaneity that suffocates the development of proletarian consciousness.

 In the fo we are 
 resuming and using Lenin's text what to do? as a weapon 
 basic for the fight against economism, which also affects today in 
 decisive way in separating the communists from the avant -garde 
 worker and the workers' avant -gardes by the communists. The economism is the 
 primacy of the union struggle on political struggle, the primacy 
 of the trade union organization on political organization. A job 
 study to be applied to the activity, to our activity, the 
 theory as part of the battle, where the militants are also 
 tools and target of the theoretical struggle, militants who incur 
 In errors also spontaneously than curbing the development of consciousness, as can also be understood by Lenin's steps that puts in 
 guard regarding the union struggle and political struggle.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Dice Lenin:
  <i>
   “There are two policies, tradunionist policy and politics 
 social democratic, given that economists do not deny the absolute 
 politics but continually deviate from the Social Democratic conception, 
 that is, revolutionary, towards the tradunionist conception of the 
 politics, the union conception of politics. And it is not about 
 give the same economic struggle or that to the struggle 
 economic is already political struggle and that this is the 
 method of leading to workers to politics through claims 
 tangible, on the contrary. The revolutionary take advantage of the agitation 
 economic not only to present claims of all kinds, 
 but also first of all to claim the suppression of the regime 
 autocratic
  </i>
  ”.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today, in this 
 march context towards a modern fascist regime, everything 
 it becomes politics and therefore training as a guide becomes necessary 
 to action and compared to the tasks of revolutionary policy, 
 Class agitation, propaganda, organization. Without doing the 
 our part for a systematic party study as we can do 
 the battle and bring the problem of training between the class 
 worker who, as Marx says, has a successful element, the 
 number, but the number does not weigh on the scale except when united 
 In community and is guided by knowledge? Because political activity, work for the proletarian revolution of the party 
 Communist MLM is the purpose of our struggles we organize, the reporting of the counter -information and crosses 
 All tools of daily activity.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Training is one 
 study agent, linked to daily practice, which allows 
 at the forefront of taking a step forward. Today the current problem is not to do 
 The revolution, but embody the first step to take it. The first step 
 It is to build the avant -garde forged by the theory and the program 
 necessary to do it. And that in the fire of the struggle in close link 
 with the workers and the masses, it is able to transform these books 
 in a practical tool, in an indication that gives us strength 
 necessary to reverse the course of a horrible world e 
 undertake the real struggle for a new world, founded on 
 reversal of the dominant classes and the construction of proletarian power, popular with its most advanced class, the working class, the one that 
 It can really change production, the social system and build 
 a state suitable for transforming the economy into economics to the service of the 
 people. A socialist economy.

  After the second round of negotiations in local public transport also canceled the second negotiating round of the union's strikes, they also submitted a cheek of "offer" in the third round of negotiations.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The central demands of the work buyers are:
 </p>
<p>
  1. Decoupling of the TV-N from the state collective agreement, especially when it comes to any wage increases and reduction in working hours.
 </p>
<p>
  2. Increasing working hours from previously 38 hours to up to 44 hours a week, without the possibility of a (tax -free) free -term compensation as before.
 </p>
<p>
  3. Absolute obligation to peace for three years, i.e. ban on strike for questions that have not yet been regulated in the collective agreement.
 </p>
<p>
  After the end of the talks, the work buyers finally claimed that they had never presented such an "offer".
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  While the trade union bureaucracy, also in Persona Paul Schmidt, continues to try to drive a reconcilable course, the mood among the workers in public transport, especially in Leipzig, is explosive. Instead of the negotiations, the ver.di actually negotiated with the work buyers about their "offer" until the conversations were finally declared failed.
 </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  There are also reports that fog candles are ignited in the circles of the fighting colleagues. Colleagues have also been demanded that trade union officials should withdraw.
 </p>
<p>
  Today it shows again that the strike is successfully managed by the workers in local transport. The Leipzig LVB was even unable to implement an emergency schedule today.

  Earn Folket Media was present at a demonstration outside Equinor's office at Sandsli in Bergen. Protesters blocked the driveway to the office's parking lot. It was a collaboration between the environment, and the climate movement and Palestine activists. The protesters demanded that Equinor stop cooperation with the Israeli company Ithaca Energy and stop the development of the Rosebank oil field.

  According to the protesters, similar actions are carried out in Oslo, Florø, Stavanger and London. The demonstration was a collaboration between Palestine's action votes, Stop the oil exploration and extinction Rebellion. The protesters were present early in the morning. With Palestinian flags and posters and banners with the text "Equinor has dirty ties - oil and Israel hand in hand".

  The protesters began at 07.30. They held several appeals and shouted slogans. Before 8 o'clock it had built a long queue in the area. And the police were thus forced to show away these cars to prevent the queue from building up. As the clock approached 9, the area was almost empty for cars.

<p>
  Earn Folket Media has interviewed several of the participants and a spokesperson for the action.
 </p>
<p>
  A spokesperson for the action explain why they demonstrate:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “Today, action votes from Palestine, Stop the oil exploration and extinction Rebellion Norway have joined forces to demonstrate against the Rosebank oil platform that will have catastrophic environmental consequences. In addition, this platform will be built with Ithaca Energy. They are owned by Israeli Delek Group. Which is blacklisted by the UN and is a company that contributes to the illegal Israeli settlements. We require the government to follow up its self -esteem report for Equinor. There, they write that companies like Equinor should follow science -based climate goals, cut emissions in line with these, and that they will enter into cooperation with actors who respect international humanitarian law. That's what we stand for here today. That Equinor has a room for maneuver that they should use. They should end the Rose Bank platform and should end the cooperation with Ithaca Energy. ”
  </p>

</figure>
<p>
  Several participants in the action were also interviewed.
 </p>
<p>
  An activist explains why such demonstration forms need:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “Because it is very tragic. The politicians do not listen to us. They have no respect for opinion in Norway and the will of the people. And when you resort to more disobedient and desperate methods. Like strike and civil disobedience. Everything is needed to end the genocide and the occupation. "
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Another activist explained it like this:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “It's about Equinor's reputation. If people are going to see what Equinor is doing we have to take a seat, we have to scream loudly. It is not enough. We don't think they want to talk to us even if we try it. The environmental movement has tried it many times. Equinor is not an actor you can have a dialogue with I think. ”
   <br>
</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The activist explains why dialogue with Equinor is not working:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
<br>
   “Because the entire company is built on the principle of the entire environment can be utilized and also that vulnerable people can be exploited. Yes, they may have a dialogue with us, but Equinor cannot exist if they do not do such things. "
  </br></p>

</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>
  The activist ended with:
 </br></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “It is very nice to gather the environmental movement and the Palestinian movement here today. It is very important. To explain and show that these problems have something to do with each other. I think solidarity is what determines whether a movement survives or collapses. We need a critical mass. That's the whole point in what we do. I am very proud to see this collaboration. ”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  After 9 o'clock, the action ended after there were no longer cars to see in the area. The shareholders succeeded in revealing the collaboration state -owned Equinor has with Israeli Ithaca Energy, which contributes to the occupation. At the same time, a signal was sent that the companies cannot work as normal while contributing to an ongoing genocide.

    Now things are different: for days the debate 
 politician revolves around a single word of the leader of the parliamentary group of the 
 SPD, Rolf Mützenich. Last week, at the Bundestag's lectern, he formulated the 
 Next question about Ukrainian policy: if it wasn't time not only 
 talk about how to fight a war, "but also to think about how to freeze 
 A war and ...
    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">
     "freeze". 
 - This expression caused the Federal Minister of Defense, Boris Pistorius, 
 member of the SPD, he responded clearly on Monday during a trip to 
 Foreign: "In the end, this would only help Putin." I should not have 
 a peace given and "no peace that leads to that -or a high fire or 
 to a freezing- in which Putin emerges stronger at the end and continues the 
 Conflict when you please, "said Pistorius.

 receiving "without peros" support.

    In 
 previous speeches of the traffic light coalition on the appropriate amount or

 initially as the hesitant and later as the one driven by the FDP and the

 Delivery of the combat car "Leopard" 2 "decided to do it late. 
 In this sense, Mützenich even did a favor, because Scholz could present himself

    . Last Thursday, the 
 leader of the SPD parliamentary group, Rolf Mützenich, caused a stir with a 
 Speech at the Bundestag. In the plenary he spoke of "freezing" war 
 in Ukraine and subsequent peace negotiations with Russia. Mützenich described 
 of "malicious" the criticism of the opposition and the politicians of the 
 traffic light to Foreign Minister Olaf Scholz: the leader of the SPD parliamentary group 
 had been criticized several times for his choice of words, even for 
 part of the traffic light matches. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Annalena

 Government and strongly shook his head. The Greens and the FDP denied

    Klingbeil himself said Sunday afternoon in the 
 Arden Miosga Interview Program: "I think reduce speech

 speech".
    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">

 of the party,
     <u>
      It is an "incredibly controversial situation" in the

 a legitimate question and is not only in its position: ultimately, the 
 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj would also demand peace negotiations, 
 According to Klingbeil. ZELENSKYJ effectively calls for peace negotiations, but to 
 same time cites the withdrawal of the Russian army as the basis for 
 Conversations from the occupied territories of Ukraine. This is totally 
 opposite to the idea of "freezing" the conflict, as Rolf Mützenich had asked. 
 A "freezing" would mean keeping the current status quo, it is 
 Say, keep the areas occupied by the Russian army. Klingbeil: there is no

  We have now entered the sixth month of the Genocystic slaughter of the Zionist state of Israel against the people of Palestine in the Gaza Strip. The unstoppable daily bombings turn the area into ruins full of murdered civilians, while the Israeli war council was approved and the invasion of Rafa. At the same time, Israel uses hunger as a weapon against the Palestinian people, but also as many analysts point out, as a tool for pressure in negotiations with Hamas. In the same direction - the pressure - is used by the Zionists and the threat of the invasion of Rafa, which also reflects the will of the extreme reactionary group of Zionists ruled by Israel and has incorporated the practices of German Nazis into its policies.
 </p>
<p>
  Maximum aim of the Zionists, to use genocidal policy as a means of massively displacing Palestinians by the Gaza Strip. This goal, despite the suffering of the Palestinian people, is not easily achieved at all, not mainly because it finds the reactionary Arab regimes opposite to "do not load the problem". But because the people of Gaza persistently refuses to abandon the place where they live and become a refugee for the second time.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
<strong>
    USA: involvement and targets
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The subtitle does not refer to the US involvement in the massacre that evolves through continuing and massive power with every murderous iron from Zionist Israel. This continues and will continue, and is probably a lever, rumors that the US may stop military aid to Tel Aviv.
  </p>
<pem>
   The highest national priority now is to tackle the barbaric Zionist aggression and the genocidal and starvation war of the occupation against our people in the Gaza Strip and to deal with the crimes of its settlers on the West Bank and under Occupation Al-Kund . Jerusalem) -especially in the al -ACSA mosque -and the significant dangers facing our national case -at the forefront of which the evolving risk of displacement is located
   ».
  </pem>
</p>
<p>
  The Americans seem to want with a double replacement (Israeli, Palestinian Authority) to resurrect the plan of a Bandustan state for the Palestinians, the protectorate of Israel, the Arab regimes and of course their own and in the second year to open the way In the forefront of the Israeli-Arab regimes approach, aimed at Iran and in the background of Russia and China.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, as they are, they use "humanitarian aid" to obtain metaphorically and literally direct access to the Gaza Strip. With the Greek Cypriot leadership, double slavery in the US and Israel, and faithfully following the ruling class of our country, it has turned Cyprus into a Xionist vineyard and at the same time laying US plans for their presence in the region. Let us note here that through the "Amalthea" operation, only 200 tonnes of food were transferred to the lane, which can be carried by 10 trucks from land, at the same time that Israel refuses to enter the lane of hundreds of trucks from the crossing of Rafa.

  The Minister of Education of Germany says schools must prepare students for the possibility of war, at the same time that the local bourgeois political system is dancing to the rhythm of June. European Council President Charles Michelle proclaims that "if he wants peace, Europe needs to be prepared for war" and that we need to "go into war economy" while at the same time, the long -haired delusions and lies for lies for lies. The "Europe of the Peoples" are re -employed by the rulers to drag their peoples to the upcoming electoral farce. So here, domestic starry is getting ready to wear the "democratic" of the costumes, at the same time as plans to dress the world of work and youth in variations whenever required.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
    Continuing to the contradictions and inherent impasses, therefore, the European imperialist building is moving towards the ballot box to highlight its decorative instrument, to make it clear from its disgusting face, which has been widely revealed. For fiery reasons for "democracy" and "participation", the leaders of the imperialist metropolis are preparing to appear, who recently landed the army on the streets against the uprisings of their peoples and criminalized every expression of solidarity with the heroic. The protagonists of anti-communist memorandums and the equation of communism-nazism, which again nourish the darkest darkness of the past of human history, which have normalized fascism and war in the daily lives of their peoples, are preparing to talk about the "future". Political representatives of local capitalism are also followed by their feet.
   </p>
<p>
    Both the ND government and the other opposition bourgeois parties, then, are taking positions in view of the European elections. It could not be done otherwise, since beyond the need to integrate the people into the imperialist European ideals who have been called upon to serve over time, they also realize that they have to prove their attachment and give all sorts of credentials to Europeans 'patrons' "At a time, in fact, great geopolitical turmoil and strong imbalances in the latter's relations with the other transatlantic pillar of the country's dependency, American imperialists.
   </p>
<p p="">
<p>
     That is why, as shocking the grandeur of a parent who has lost his child and struggles for justification, so unforgivable is his miserable exploitation in the context of imperialist contradictions or the need for European bosses to consider their slaves! Even more, they are devastating for the working class, the people and the youth. The illusions that have been cultivated lately by the bourgeois opposition of SYRIZA, PASOK, the New Left and others, but also by the forces of the varied Left, that the EU and the EU and Her parliament is about the "guardian angel" of popular rights, that we will punish the "bad" government of Mitsotakis addressing the "good" Europeans who protect us.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, another that the left of the defeat and submission do not want! Characteristic of the case of the KKE, which is in a hurry to close the youth struggle to wear its electoral tie, with the local elections finished, turned her eyes there and all her action has revolved for months around the "mother" of battles. " Some organizations have even arrived to draw on Eurobonds in the midst of student uprising! All of them, in front of the election and delusions, are running once again to give their legitimacy to the ballot box of imperialist wolves and to assist in the struggle of the sovereigns against the "curse" abstention!
    </p>
<p>
     Because the forces of the system of dependence and exploitation are well aware that in today's phase they are marching in the incandescent territory of social wrath and indignation that is increasingly expanding and multiplying on existing terms of volatility of the urban political scene. Thus, in the tricks produced by the geopolitical position of our bourgeoisie, but also, in relation to the previous one, in the vibration of a diverted bumpy economy, which stands weak in front of "extrinsic threats", according to a recent report by JP Morgan, The data of the rage of the "below" will be constantly added.
    </p>
<p>
     The massive disapproval of the cover -up of the Tempi Inquiry Committee is precisely. With poverty and poverty spread out, with capitalist accuracy kneeling the social majority, with the government announcing the end of various benefits and passes and submission to "fiscal stability", with the people being exiled to hospitals and hospitals and hospitals. Any ability to access health care, with the long -awaited increase in the minimum wage proven to be a mockery that has already disappeared, it is clear that waves of dissatisfaction are being formed in the popular masses, which can be controlled, as long as they are struggling to be trapped in the ballot box. and in painless or even dangerous solutions.
    </p>
<p>
     The brutality of the repressive forces against students who insist on occupations against the Pierrakakis law, threats to imprisonment against the "unruly" teachers who deny evaluation proves that the lawmakers will be more and more often resorted to "To halt the social processes that are evolving, because they simply have no choice. "In front of the law the road is not allowed" is the message they seek to send, because this outlet is scared!
    </p>
<p>
     We have to strengthen this way out! By gathering the forces and fighters who insist that nothing is over, that the struggle for the overthrow of the Pierrakakis law must continue, that the common front of the common front of workers and youth. With the coincidence of those tendencies who refuse to legitimize the miserable construct of the Eurocup of the imperialists, shouting everywhere the choice of the electoral farce, showing the path of the mass struggle against the EU and NATO bonds. To finally serve the prospect of the confrontation of the working class, the people and the youth with the regime of imperialist dependence, the prospect of revolutionary overthrow of exploitation and social liberation!

<p>
  After completing the work of the House of Inquiry Committee on the Crime of Tempi, based on the publicity of the signatures issue and with the recent black anniversary and anger of the world expressed in the strike on 28 February, the climate of the climate. It was burdened for the government and made it difficult for the concealment operation.
 </p>
<p>
  The government, as expected, went on the offensive and moved on two main axes: First, it accused the opposition of instrumentalizing the tragedy and using the dead and the pain of their relatives in its political confrontation with it (political leeches, government spokesman Marinakis described them). And secondly, she presented herself as the only one responsible who could really satisfy the demand of the relatives, but also of all the people, for full clarification of the case and punishment of the guilty with real and objective evidence.
 </p>
<p>
  Mitsotakis himself moved in these directions in his interview with SKAI TV. Taking the well-known, apparently elaborated by his communication team "human" style, he said that he did not forget the sights and smells the next day, when he went to the scene of the crime, the debris of which was imposed by the human need to support the cranes somewhere to lift the wagons and retrieve the bodies. His humanity was exhausted somewhere there, because he was very cynical when he said that the railway is as safe as it can be, without ruling out, in fact, more deaths in the future...
 </p>
<p>
  The same directions were followed, with relatively aggressive tones, the government in the debate in Parliament on the finding of the examination, namely ND! A finding that he found no other responsible despite the human factor and ... the evil at a time when they were brought up and became looming mistakes and omissions that led to the conflict.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, the ND turned all over the people. He knows that the crime of Tempi has caused his anger, which has repeatedly expressed on the street, at very massive rallies, but even in the one and a half million signatures, despite the objections we have about them.
 </p>
<p>
  What worries her, much more than she wants to show, is that this wrath of the world accumulates and concerns almost all aspects of his life. One of all the issues that opens up daily on the people's and youth rights can become the drop that will make the glass overflow, with unpredictable consequences.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, in the issue of Tempi, it wants to achieve two conflicting goals: to conceal the crime, to rid its ministers and itself from political responsibilities and to calm the anger of both relatives and people. And the pie and the dog grass, that is, something that if she has hoped to succeed is only because of her domination in the urban political scene and, above all, because of the absence of a popular movement so massive, contemplative and relentless that she will force her to do back.
 </p>
<p>
  In the debate in the House, her superiority was obvious, not only because she dared and went on the counterattack, but also because "
  <em>
   Group fire
  </em>
  "Against her, who was written in the press, probably not even touched by SYRIZA, PASOK, New Left and Freedom Cruise were far from expressing the popular feeling of concealment. And how could they, after all, have to be held accountable for what they did or did not do when they were in government positions, preparing the road that led to the crime.
 </p>
<p>
  As for the KKE, he defended his proposal for the establishment of the Inquiry Committee, which was implemented, saying that he had no illusions because he knew his limits, but was validated because the effort was revealed, new elements came to light, but also fueled. The mobilizations of people and youth! If it weren't for the exams would the strike and rallies be less crowded on 28 February? Discourse distortion of reality, with goals that are not present…
 </p>
<p>
  However, pressure is being exerted on the government on the EU side, following the intervention of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and the questioning of parliamentary immunity and the law on ministerial responsibility, which has opened up the whole debate on whether European legislation takes precedence over the relevant Article 86 of the Constitution. Also, after Karystianou's speeches in the European Parliament, it was decided to keep in operation the competent EU committees for the control of the judicial process, which, however, is progressing very quickly, by Greek standards.
 </p>
<p>
  The question is where. Pressures by the EU do not have the ... pure intention of the administration of justice to a member state that is suffering in this area. But they are moves on the political-geopolitical chessboard, aiming for a member state that is increasingly bound to the chariot of the great transatlantic ally and suffers in the field of ... dedication to the Union.
 </p>
<p>
  In any case, the most substantial pressure that can be exerted on the government is by the people through their mobilizations. Because as Karystianos herself said at some point, the justification will be not to happen again. Whatever this means, we will fill in…

   The case of the deceased is not unique. On the contrary, it is the usual and describes the regularity of the people as a result of the chronic attack of the system in the popular right to equal, complete and free care. Prime Minister Mr. Mitsotakis is proud of upgrading the NHS by advertising the absorption of funds by the recovery fund for renovation of buildings, while Minister Georgiadis is photographed with the first patient to be operated on afternoon. In fact, Georgiadis argues that only 1% disagree with paid surgeries and the rest of the health and people have been waiting for it for decades!
  </p>
<p>
   This is not an attempt to convert white into black. The reality is reality and the people do not chew puppy. However, they are aware of the limits of the political submission of trade unions and reformist forces and have weighted the reaction of the "below". They know, of course, that they cannot have a popular acceptance of a series of measures that make it even more difficult for the labor terms of health care and force the people to put their hand in the pocket even deeper to find their health.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
     The people will pay a new hike for diagnostic tests per referral. One euro for laboratory and three for imaging, with the aim of repaying clawback. The clawback is essentially money that did not pay doctors and diagnostic centers for exams already performed by EOPYY coverage due to fiscal adjustments. Mitsotakis' successful surpluses at the discretion of the imperialists are robbing the care of the people.
    </p>
<p>
     The increases in medicines have already been preceded by paying in addition to the contribution even when the insured receives the cheapest generic (see pp. 957). This, according to the "small" government, unravels the pension of the elderly, who usually take more than one medicine. Especially in cases where the cheaper drug is not even selected, as shortcomings have been normal after the export prohibition has been lifted and pharmacies are supplied by drugs from the dropper warehouses. On the side of them, the payment of five euros for the vaccine for COVID19 in pharmacies is established.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, but certainly not finally as the same policy will continue as long as sufficient popular resistance is formed, the personal physician will be paid. The personal doctor is declared to be a barrier to patients' access to hospitals. Together with the patient's electronic folder, the government is trying to seal the NHS environment to upgrade its ability to restrict access and broaden charges. He stumbled upon both in the reluctance of doctors' participation due to low earnings and intensification. The electronic dossier is proceeding with EU funding and compulsory implementation in hospitals. The obstacle to the non -participation of private doctors due to low earnings is passed by paying the patient the patient. Most likely it is that the patient will not even be able to visit the personal doctor who will refuse to access the hospital. Barrier to the barrier ...
    </p>
<p>
     The continuity and intensity of policy that will ruin labor rights for health care and the right of the people to free and equal to all care is a given. What we should constantly concern to us is how to build resistance on the part of the popular forces in the direction of getting a barrier to this policy. Skopelos of sold union leaders and the political line of reformist forces, with the KKE, are recognized obstacles in the development of this direction. But given the general popular discontent, which can fuel significant resistance outbreaks.

   From its initial phase and throughout its journey to its present form, the EU has been and exists as a venture of Europe's imperialists. It is a coalition to serve and promote interests and aspirations before all its imperialist pillars. It is the incomparable contradictions between these imperialist forces that set boundaries in the "unity" of the project, which is anything but historical law. Brexit was a clear manifestation of these contradictions, which today occur between its two main pillars (France-Germany) and are transferred to their satellites, but are also fueled by US involvement in a number of countries and bourgeoisie in today's coalition. of "27".
  </li>
<li li="">
<li li="">
<li li="">
<li>
      All of the above are already reflected in the political systems of all EU countries, which are facing the depreciation of the labor-like masses and are shifting in reactionary direction, and with the emergence (even in government roles) of far-right forces. Forces fueled by the general attack on the proletariat and the peoples, by the escalation of politics that stifle freedoms and democratic rights, the policy of wars and preachs of nationalism, hatred and division of peoples. At the same time, in the imperialist countries (France, Germany, but also Italy), the emergence of these far -right forces is also an expression of dissatisfaction with the megalistic class that are squeezed by imperialist competitions and seeking answers by promoting the most aggressive nationalism.
     </li>
</li>
</li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The "great upheaval" in view of the June European elections and the criticality attributed to them by imperialists and bourgeois forces are actually referring to all the above issues. The sovereign forces seek to exploit the Europes as a tool, on the one hand to renovate it - overall in the consciences of the peoples - "idea" of the EU, and on dealing with problems in each country's political systems. It is very characteristic that all far -right forces are zealous in the election campaign and support the "idea" of the EU, without a trace of "isolation". They thus prove again their complete bowing both in the imperialist context and the needs of the bourgeoisie that each is mentioned.
 </p>
<ol start="6">
<li li="">
<li li="">
</li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
  That is why all parties in the system (from the far -right to the so -called center -left) bombard the people demanding to forget, ignore the suffering that has accumulated and accumulates from the country's integration into the EU/EMU, and to seek (with them or with them or other negotiations) in this future! That is why in the name of the "cooperation of the peoples" that the EU is representing, its country and its seas are transformed into a tomb and a prison of the uprooted pieces of peoples, to protect European borders from the oppressed. With the same invocation (of the "cooperation of the peoples"), the country is ordered in a war and hatred position with the peoples of the region to serve its Euro -Atlantic patrons!
 </p>
<ol start="8">
<li li="">
<li>
    Based on all of the above, it is also obvious than the sun that the big struggles, demands and interests of the working-bodies of Europe cannot "meet"-and much more justified-within the prison of the peoples that the people that the people European imperialists have formed and heard in the name of the EU! The class rights and the revolutionary perspective of the masses cannot be expressed in an instrument such as the European Parliament, which is not the conquest of the peoples, but an imperialist construction. In the complaint of this construction and the struggle against the EU lies the path of "meeting" the struggles, the internationalist solidarity, the development of the mass struggle of workers and peoples. This struggle forms the terms of revolutionary perspective to the extent that it is emancipated by the political context defined by the capitalist-imperialist system, to the extent that it refuses to be chased in this political context and opens its own paths.
   </li>
<li>
    In our country, prolonged election campaign in view of 9

<li>
     The wide popular aversion and dissatisfaction with the policy of the ND government, the policy of the system and all the parties that support it - from the so -called center -left (SYRIZA, PASOK, Cruise, New Left) and from the far -right (Velopoulos, Niki) - It does not fit into the "official gallop" of the European elections. It should not be perverted by blackmailing the acceptance of imperialist dependence on the EU.
     <strong>
      The people have no reason to share the upheaval and reactionary processes of the political system. It has every reason to continue on the path of mass struggles and every reason to deny Eurocalp, to abstain from it. Because she
     </strong>
     The electoral stance corresponds to the promotion of the necessary position "Outside Greece from the EU". Why this electoral attitude highlights the
     <strong>
      total denial

     The US and European imperialists, the refusal of the "one -way" of poverty, poverty, exploitation and wars, which ensures the country's dependency.

     <strong>
      Abstinence from the European elections
     </strong>
     We seek coordination with racing, leftist, revolutionary forces in Europe. On the same basis, we also seek in our country the wider promotion of this direction, coordination, co -ordination and jointly forming a political campaign to promote the position "Outside Greece from the EU", for denial and opposition to Europalpe and the reactionary aspirations of the parties and forces of the system.

   The obstacles for the students of the poor and popular layers are multiplying. The government is trying rapidly to unfold the agenda of the attack on schools. It is reported that the National Bachelor's Degree will be "inaugurated" by students who will study in the First High School in the following school year, who will have to face a high school examination of the Pan -Hellenic, with the issues of the Bank and the Bank of Themes in all three classes of the High School. Special gravity coefficient per class (larger in the 3rd and smaller in the 1st High School), while at the same time providing the number of admissions to higher education from the universities.
   <strong>
    With the law on private universities, the hard class framework continues to be implemented, in which the children of popular families will not only be thrown outside the universities but also by the General High Schools, promoting the government as an alternative to channeling to the Professional education and apprenticeship.

Next to the students who have given a massive and militant struggle for months so that the Pierrakakis law would not pass. Next to teachers who are terrified because they claim labor rights and crawl in trials for their trade union action. The struggle against the education of the few and the chosen is a matter of struggle for the whole people.

  The invasion of Police Forces at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki at noon on Saturday 16/3 to evacuate the occupations that were held in sections and the arrest of 49 students is a serious example of the system's revanchism.
 </p>
<p>
  Using damage outside the "Library" in the former biological hangout (which has been evacuated for 2 years since it was evacuated, still ... a library), police forces stormed into the site of the time when action took place as part of the occupation of S. PHI. Geology, arresting mass students, who attributed accusations of disturbing common peace and apathy. Indeed, the arrested students were held in GADTH until Monday 18/3, telling them that "ahead of the 2 months holding the occupation, 2 days of booking are nothing." It is clear that the real reason for this repressive operation is no deterioration of a building or "illegal energy". They were only looking for one occasion, up to that of ... "nuclear rifle", or whatever they could be dug up, to justify the invasion and the brutal repression.
 </p>
<p>
  The timing of evacuation and arrests of arrests in the FAI is no accident. In a phase where the student movement is in retreat, the system has found the opportunity to take the "rematch", to hit whatever flaws and resistors have remained in the schools. It is not, after all, the first evacuation of the occupation that the student movement has seen in its two -month struggle against the most voted on Pierrakakis law. The evacuation of the occupation of Law in Komotini, the Law of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and the Rector, a few weeks ago showed government moods. Even at the University of Athens Student Homes (FEPA) they invaded, arresting 3 students and attributing them 3 categories. The system is afraid of the student youth that, for 2 months, is on the streets and is fighting. In particular, it does not tolerate students who, even after the law is passed, insist on getting on the way to overthrow him.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   He is called, on the other hand, to put them with his false friends. Under the responsibility of the main reformist forces (KNE-ARIS) who declared a cessation of the movement, but also by all others who see the struggle to overthrow the law as something "utopian", the students who have been motivated by persistence all the time, They were left untouched. On the one hand, they refer to "diverse actions beyond the occupation", which they seem to not even include ... the demonstration. Indeed, in the majority of clubs nationwide, these forces are now rallying the frames of "anti-occupation", while with the force (until not at all) supported solidarity mobilizations to the arrested students. On the other hand, Ara and a series of other forces come out with the flag of "to keep the law on paper". As if we did not see with the minimum introduction base what was happening with the laws that were "left on paper". At some point their system applies them!
  </p>
<p>
   So, in these rationales, the student movement must stack its legs and continue the fight for the overthrow of Pierrakakis. Continue with re -General Assemblies, which will make decisions to continue the struggle with new occupations and demonstrations. The student movement has shown that it can overturn even voted laws, and no power - component or reformist - can deny it!
  </p>
<p>
   And that is what will be the real response to terrorism and repression. This is what will be the real response to the non -existent accusations of the 49 arrests of the RA and the threats of disciplinary persecution and student deletions. The student movement can only be "protected" and respond to terrorism! With mass general assemblies that will make solidarity decisions to the detainees, they will demand their acquittal and make decisions continued until the victory!

<p>
  Ukraine's possible defeat will highlight the weaknesses of Western mechanisms. And this is something that exacerbates a sense of strategic impasse, especially for European imperialists.
 </p>
<p>
  The situation on the Ukrainian front is such that it no longer dictates scenarios for the evolving conflict, but for the next day. Having Moscow the initiative of movement, the agonizing question is not where it will stop, but where it wants to stop. The centers of the West estimate, and justified, that its goals are no longer limited to the border of the four provinces attached.
 </p>
<p>
  European (if) security has many versions and varied events. Recently, the timeliness has been monopolized by Macron's threats (lionism), which begin with the "bomb" statement that NATO forces should not be ruled out to Ukraine.
 </p>
<p>
  It didn't take much time since June 2022, when Macron stated: '
  <em>
   I am convinced that the role of France is that of a mediating force
  </em>
  "! Today, despite his ambiguities and old -fashioned, he constantly throws oil on the fire ... "
  <em>
   We are not in a straight conflict with Russia but we cannot let her win
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   We are not in war with Russia, but it is waging war against us
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   If Russia wins this war, Europe's credibility will be reduced to zero
  </em>
  »Etc. For Moscow, such a demonstration of power (albeit rhetoric) by the head of the French state, in addition to a type of bluff, can be considered a "trolley" of Western intentions.
 </p>
<p>
  However, Macron's anti -Russian bids may have other extensions. The bourgeoisie has seen its "credibility" decrease in recent years in a traditional sphere of influence: West Africa. Whether the eastern edge of Europe can be a compensatory field of action of French imperialism is very doubtful. However, more or less, Macron tells the countries of A. Europe that France does not have the suspensions of Germany and is willing (and capable?) To replace US guarantees at national or even European level! This intention was updated at the recent trilateral German, France and Poland summit in Berlin.
 </p>
<p>
  For his part, German Chancellor Saltz, after clarifying that countries supporting Ukraine are not in war with Russia, was sufficient in Brussels' declarations regarding Europe's help to Ukraine. Is the issue to what extent it controls its three -party government? In the extreme pro -Nursery and anti -Russian statements by Foreign Ministry Berbok (Greens), Germany's Minister of Education Vacinger (Liberals) were added, who, in an interview with the Funke Group newspapers, proposes the preparation of the students (in the context of the pupils). War ... it even imagines it as part of everyday life!
 </p>
<p>
  There are not many. Or the West will move towards a complete conflict with Russia or try to halt it by negotiations, mitigating any costs. If the second is true (which does not mean the immediate end of the war), the terms will basically be dictated by Moscow. It is obvious that both sides do not approach a ceasefire in Ukraine in the same way. It is not only that this should start with the acceptance of the new borders and the consolidation of any acquisitions, but they should also respond to their long -term strategic goals. In such a scenario it is estimated that the Russian delegation will reach the table with a sense of strategic advantage. For the Kremlin it is a key condition that the negotiations will not define a new "frozen conflict" or "a break for Ukraine re -equipment".
 </p>
<p>
  The Russian president (who was not particularly struggling for his re -election) does not seem to put the consultations on the forefront. In his public festive speech (on his election victory and the anniversary of Crimea's attachment), he reiterated warnings to the West for the use of nuclear in any "official" development of Western troops in Ukrainian territories. These Putin warnings are not made in the void. The background is long -term and the controversy exceeds the borders of Ukraine. It became clear by Russia that a possible West-Russia negotiation would not be limited to its "territorial" as its future neutrality and demilitarization. And may require safeguards concerning all A. Europe
 </p>
<p>
  In the estimation of Western analysts, it appears that the US would be enough for Russia to leave Ukraine without other territorial conquests. Putin's appeal is considered to be the dismissal of Nuland, number 3 to the State Department, with a field of responsibility in Ukraine for at least ten years. However, this action could also be considered an indirect assumption of Russia's achievements in Ukraine!
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   All of this reflect fears of the correlations that are going to be shaped, as developments, and the uncertain of their end in both the battlefields in Ukraine but also gauze as well as throughout the Middle East. There are uncertain parameters that form an unprecedented situation, raising more issues of re -evaluation of imperialist relations. A state of fine balances, reflecting the interests of the dominant imperialists both peripheral and the world stage as a whole.
  </p>
<p>
   A situation that, highlighting its multifaceted dynamics, may be the reason for the inevitable and violent adjustment of US strategies and priorities. A situation where "continued politics by other means" will tend to become a rule.

 Some divisions of the Royal Army: the armistice is signed on 8 September, 
 At dawn of 9 September the king, badoglio and the high military positions 
 They abandoned the capital and the army found themselves without directives. A part of 
 soldiers tried to counter the German army and, together with organized civilians 
 from the anti -fascist parties, he stands at Porta S. Paolo where you resist as long as the

   Already in the high school years he was an anti -fascist assets. With Leonardo 
 Jannaccone, Corrado Nourian and Nino Baldini constituted, in 1939, a 
 group called "Marxist unification", which he attracted soon 
 The attention of the fascist police. Arrested in 1941, after release 
 Bentivegna joined the Communist Party in 1943. With the armistice and the 
 training of the patriotic action groups, he was among the most valiant protagonists 
 of the Resistance, both in Rome (assault on German soldiers in Piazza Barberini, 
 Attack on a fascist procession in via Tomacelli) that in the Casilina area,

  In our long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br/>
  history of class struggle for all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at the same time that
  <br/>
  despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the
  <br/>
  British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the
  <br/>
  success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to
  <br/>
  the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat
  <br/>
  Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we
  <br/>
  have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded
  <br/>
  with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly
  <br/>
  opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including
  <br/>
  Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack
  <br/>
  the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them
  <br/>
  and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.
  <br/>
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br/>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire
  <br/>
  economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
  <br/>
  native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br/>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their
  <br/>
  Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and
  <br/>
  displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to
  <br/>
  face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
  <br/>
  Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure
  <br/>
  was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more
  <br/>
  and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly
  <br/>
  implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to
  <br/>
  the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India,
  <br/>
  Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro-
  <br/>
  imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over
  <br/>
  the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country
  <br/>
  through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and
  <br/>
  communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today
  <br/>
  the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br/>
  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out
  <br/>
  from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has
  <br/>
  abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the
  <br/>
  resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
  <br/>
  India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the
  <br/>
  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green-
  <br/>
  Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous
  <br/>
  people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis
  <br/>
  ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive
  <br/>
  deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from
  <br/>
  the Adivasi region. People's resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are
  <br/>
  being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific
  <br/>
  news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until
  <br/>
  and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid
  <br/>
  on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
  <br/>
  developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the
  <br/>
  people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this
  <br/>
  enemy's machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and
  <br/>
  women's organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists
  <br/>
  to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
  <br/>
  seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideals of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in order to expose the
  <br/>
  treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

     In the 
  Very central via Indipendenza of Bologna, the police today loaded and 
  Pushed university students for days in mobilization.
    </span>
</span>

</p>

<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Yesterday 
  In Bologna, university students had protested in front of the 
 Academic Senate to ask for the end of the censorship against 
 those who mobilize against the war in Palestine, to demand the 
 boycott of agreements with Israel and the military sector 
 industrial.
    </span>
</span>

<img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-170586 alignleft" height="300" src="https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2024/03/Bologna-universita-Palestina-striscione-300x300.jpg" srcset="https://assets.contropiano.org/img/2024/03/Bologna-universita-Palestina-striscione-300x300.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     The 
  Academic Senate refused to terminate the agreements in the field 
 military and war, expressing himself with yet another vaga formula e 
 smoky, substantially reiterating the need to respect the 
 regulations and the ethical code which, as regards the dual use, yes 
 I limit to "minimizing any damage" ...
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     We want 
  And we demand a concrete commitment of the University that goes to terminate 
  All agreements with the Leonardo group, with NATO and with the partners 
 of the Zionist government of Israel ”wrote the 
 Students to change the course of the Bolognese university.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     The 
  mobilizations in our country show that getting the boycott is 
  possible and we can do it only through the struggle, as happened yesterday 
 to the academic Senate of the University of Turin, where thanks to the 
 mobilization has been able to obtain non -participation 
 of the Torinese University to the new Maeci of cooperation tender between Italy and 
 Israel".

     But 
  Today Minister Bernini arrived in Bologna for the inauguration 
 of the academic year and the students mobilized to do 
 hear, also in light of the Minister's statements against

     The 
  procession of the students who arrived in via Indipendenza tried to 
 reach the headquarters of the Manzoni Theater where the ceremony took place with 
  Minister Bernini, but found a deployment against him 
 of the police who soon went to the de facto roads by loading e 
 pushing the students. The procession reappeared the files and is 
 directed in a university area.

<span>
<span>
      There 
  protest was also revealed within the theater where it was present 
 A group of students with the Palestine flag. Francesca 
 representative of the Student Council, intervened shortly before 
 of the intervention of the Minister of the University, Anna Maria Bernini, with 
 Kefiah around the neck. “For months we have been witnessing the systemic censorship of 
 voices from the Palestinian community and what are the 
 requests of student mobilizations ”denounced the 
 Student.

  NATO troops, together with their political staffs are on the territory of Yugoslavia, distributed in BiH, Croatia and Macedonia.
 </p>
<p>
  The NATO Pact created American imperialists in cooperation with the Imperialists of Western Europe in 1947. Concerned about the great victories of the Soviet Union, the creation of the Socialist Tabor, the victory of the Red Army in China and the most more powerful anti-Colonial and anti-primerial movements in the third world countries, as an aggressive military block against the Soviet Union, China and Liberation Movements in Colonies. From the very beginning of his creation he formed as a stroke military fist, which was supposed to won the Soviet Union and other socialist countries militarily and to restore capitalism in them. Direct NATO interventions in Vietnam, Latin America and Africa are known.
 </p>
<p>
  At the end of the 1980s, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact was disbanded, and the countries in the composition of the Soviet Union, as well as the countries of Eastern Europe, liquidated socialism and went through the restoration of capitalism.

<p>
  When the main opponent of the NATO Pact was disappeared - Warsaw Pact, it seemed to be normal to dissolve the NATO Pact. Instead, the NATO pact is even more reinforced, conveniently, the most perfect types of weapons and increased the military budgets of the NATO member. Using economically, diplomatic, political and military pressure makes everything to expand, not only to all countries of Eastern Europe, but also on all the countries of the former Soviet Union and thus reaches Russia's borders. It is the goal of being completely insulate that Russia, they put it on their knees and the countries of the former Soviet Union create a kind of semi-coloni, to use their huge natural resources unobstructed, to gain abundance of cheap labor and spacious market. It is obvious that the NATO pact remains an aggressive military force of imperialism and it seems everything in order to provide the rule of imperialism throughout the world, but only to economic and financial resources in the world's military force.
 </p>
<p>
  NATO Pact is the reactionary military force of American imperialism, the most dangerous enemy of the socialism and the people of the third world countries.
 </p>
<p>
  Why did NATO's troops come to Yugoslavia?
 </p>
<p>
  The United States and the NATO Pact, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the other only superpowers, the only global force in the world. One of the strategic goals of the United States and the NATO is not allowed to get out of the events in the world to escape their control and start developing their influence or against them. They still watched the war in Slovenia, Croatia for several years, and especially in BiH, they did not consider to intervene. However, they concluded that the continuation of the war in BiH would inevitably led to its expansion to Kosovo, Macedonia and the entire Balkans and to enter Turkey and Greece, two important NATO members against the other. The NATO Pact then decided to send troops and stop the war in BiH. They forced Milosevic and Tudjman to sign the Dayton Agreement.
 </p>
<p>
  One other element seriously influenced that the application of the Dayton Agreement, as well as the intention to resolve Kosovo and enable longer and more stable peace in the Balkans. The rush of the United States and NATO is caused by the possibility of "exploding" Turkey soon, and with it the entire East, they may be found in the war with the entire Muslim world that now counts about a billion and one hundred million people.
 </p>
<p>
  What is the attitude of the work party in connection with the presence of NATO in Yugoslavia?
 </p>
<p>
  Party of Labor considers that this should be considered without emotion and assess whether the presence of NATO is used in the NATO presence or harms the people of Yugoslavia. The team before there were cases in history when the interests of the imperialist, if it was a joint enemy, could coincide with the interests of the people. This happened in the Second World War when the Soviet Union concluded a pact with the two largest imperialistic forces of that time - the United States and English for the fight against the common enemy of Hitler's German.
 </p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, nationalism affects wide masses in Yugoslavia. Greater Serbian and Great Rhine Chauvinists, in fact, with their policy of the war and endangering the U.S. and NATO global interests and NATO's arrival in Yugoslavia. The fact is that in Yugoslavia, just because of these widespread nationalist consciousness, they could not organize forces that would oppose the disastrous, chauvinist politics of Milosevic and Tudjman. The fact is that they did not arrive NATO troops and the force of their weapons stopped war, would probably have been thousands of thousands of dead, new destruction and new crimes during the two years.
 </p>
<p>
  The act of stopping the war was positive. Efforts to apply the Dayton Agreement, ensure the unique BiH, return all refugees to their homes and that the penalties of war criminals, the PR is considered the interest in the people of Yugoslavia. Application of the Dayton Agreement and resolving Kosovo issues A missing blow to the Great Serbian conquerable war policy, and the nationalism in Yugoslavia, which was the main substrate of that policy. That is why the PR in this situation is not against the presence of NATO for now, because at this moment it is in the interest of the people of Yugoslavia.
 </p>
<p>
  But, if even after the establishment of peace in BiH and resolving these basic problems, NATO troops will be remained in Yugoslavia, the Party of the work will be considered for occupiers, which will really be. Then the PR as a true patriotic party will organize a political and other fight against NATO presence, all the way to the armed fight for the liberation of the Earth from the occupier.

     CUT Congress from February 26 to March 1, 2024
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   A few weeks ago the VIII Cong Congress was held in the city of Bogotá, prior to this, the Congress of Youth and that of CUT women was held.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    Meanwhile, the Cut Congress did give him a decision and by delegates, with the aggravating man who arrived the documents already made and machine to show a majority that approved them. They also invited the Minister of Labor and the Deputy Minister, despite being criticized by the base workers, because although they were unionists, they are now part of the State institutions that are at the service of the capitalists regardless of their intentions.
   </p>
<p>
    It is obvious that, if they do not allow them to speak to those who dare to criticize, union democracy is not being exercised, and a always majority approves the conclusions that are already machined from above. In this way, the new delegates, especially from other cities, believe that this is the way of working in the trade union movement, ignoring that union democracy is too much from being that, because the minority must be allowed to defend their positions.
   </p>
<p>
    That is why trade unionism, managed by bourgeois ideology does not serve the collective interests of the working class, so far it has only served to promote those bureaucrats in state positions, it has served for many leaders to turn the union into their Minor box, while the workers are orphaned and at the mercy of what the patterns want to do with them.
   </p>
<p>
    That is why from these pages we have been denouncing that bourgeois policy of conciliation and concertation of classes, which are precisely the foundations of the CUT.
   </p>
<p>
    In the political statement that presented as a final conclusion of the VIII Congress, it is claimed that the salary increase approved for this year was an achievement. Surely none of those bureaucrats earns a minimum wage, nor do they have The most brutal persecution for the bosses, most of the CUT bureaucracy no longer feels what it is to live with a pyrric minimum wage. That is, these bureaucracies do not represent the majority as they know, and do deceive and handle the workers preventing them from organizing with class independence and building their own organizations.
   </p>
<p>
    The political statement of the CUT is just one more speech, but what they defend there is pure demagogy; That bureaucracy has become a machinery that does not allow it to be changed from the inside, it is similar to a tiny state, impossible to change because the State since it was created has the function of guaranteeing the privileges of the classes that have economic power, And in the case of the CUT, from birth it was tied by the ideology and politics of the bourgeoisie, which made it the engendro that is today.
   </p>
<p>
    It is an immediate need for trade union organizations to cease to be behind a trade that can do the bureaucracies of union plants. The trade union movement must fight for their organization with independence of class and from the streets, with the complaint and protest to tear the vindications of the people to the bourgeoisie; But it is essential to act organized and centralized, under principles that represent its class, which returns to solidarity strikes.
   </p>
<p>
    But this must be worked as aware and with a lot of commitment, understanding that the claims are solved collectively, really organized in independent federations, that they are the foundations of a true independent central for its ideology and politics at the service of workers and not of employers , a central one that directs the struggle of workers in improving their conditions, but not to stay as salaried slaves, but to have the strength to fight against capitalism, against wage exploitation and the construction of a new society, socialism .
   </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
     Advance the restructuring of the trade union movement!

     Mayora Carmelina Yule Paví - March 20, 2024

</div>
<p class="has-text-align-right">
<em>
    The day I die, the day I am not in the territory, you do not stay there, do not be afraid to die. After they are fighting with their hands, with their cane, it is the greatest pride they can have, not like them, that they are cowards who hold a weapon and with that weapon they want to intimidate us, but no, do not let themselves bend, be they brave, talk
   </em>
   «, Said María Teresa about the legacy left by her mother Carmelina.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Since Saturday, March 16, several acts of violence against the NASA community have been presented in the rural area of the municipality of Toribío (Cauca), there was killed the indigenous leader Carmelina Yule Paví, 52, was injured when he accompanied Members of the Indigenous Guard to rescue a minor who had forced to be recruited by the Dagoberto Ramos Front of the Central General Staff (EMC) of the FARC dissidents. Subsequently, the Indigenous Community and Guard rescued 2 girls who had been kidnapped. During the funeral of Mayora Carmelina, they were again victims of armed harassment by the same armed group.
  </p>

</p>
<p>
   The armed conflict generates massacres, forced recruitment, is favored by the lack of opportunities in education and work. The abandonment of the field by the State, leads rural communities to poverty; In particular, children and young people become cannon fodder, due to the war for the dispute of the gain of coca, poppy and marijuana crops.
  </p>
<p>
   This reactionary war, made by the different armed groups such as the paramilitaries, the armed forces of the State, the dissidents of the FARC, the ELN and common crime groups, has cost the lives of thousands of young people for decades and although in the new Government promotes the speech of "total peace", the war continues in the field, pointing to the extermination of the communities.
  </p>
<p>
   With this action, the decomposition of dissidents is demonstrated since they do not have a political base ennobled by socialism, which guides its cause against the enemies of the people; On the contrary, they have become a poster rather than massacra to their own people.
  </p>
<p>
   Hence, the requirement for the Government to meet its promises to generate sources of employment, to deliver land to the communities, provide the conditions for free and quality education for primary, secondary and university.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    The most urgent demands in this situation to Petro's government:
   </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    That the government protects the life of communities within the territories.
   </li>
<li>
    After the suspension of the bilateral and temporary ceasefire agreement in the departments of Cauca, Nariño and Valle del Cauca. Which means that the government resumes military actions against the dissent of the FARC, it is necessary that the indigenous guard be recognized as a government of territorial control of all regions with the legal and legislative legal, political, political rights.
   </li>
<li>
    Change illicit crops for lawful: that the production of coca and marijuana crops is legalized since they have become an industry where the profits are carried by local and foreign investors and it is the communities that put the dead.
   </li>
<li>
    That university academic training is promoted by building universities in the 10 departments of the South West.
   </li>
<li>
    That sources of employment are generated based on agricultural and technified mining production to take care of the environment, a situation that would avoid the migration of young people to the cities in search of employment and especially not to be part of the armed groups becoming perpetrators of His own communities.
   </li>
</ul>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   We reject Carmelina's murder.
   <br>
   No more kidnapping of young people, or forced recruitment.
   <br>
   Below the war against the people.
   <br>
   Neither the State, nor the politicians, only the people saves the people.

  Supreme Federal Court Minister Alexandre de Moraes ordered, on the afternoon of March 22, the pre-trial detention of the Army Lieutenant Colonel, Mauro Cid, after the leak of an audio in which Lieutenant Colonel launches criticisms Against the minister, the STF and the Federal Police (PF). The audios were published in full this morning by the magazine of the communication monopoly, see. In the afternoon, Mauro Cid was called to testify in the STF and was arrested for "breach of precautionary measure." The Supreme Court also threatens to cancel the award -winning plea agreement, but should maintain the validity of the evidence offered by ICD.
 </p>
<p>
  Cid's arrest warrant was served shortly after the award -winning report on March 22, which lasted 1h30. Cid was accused of “obstruction of justice” and “non -compliance with precautionary measures”.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  What the whistleblower's leaked audios say
 </h4>
<p>
  In the audios, Lieutenant Colonel accuses the PF to distort his words, take the phrases out of context and hide some contents of the statements intentionally. He states that the Supreme Court and PF has a “ready narrative” and just want to prove it at any cost, and were even coerced to say things I didn't know. “They are the law now. The law is over. Alexandre de Moraes is the law. He holds, he lets out, when he wants, as he wants. With prosecutor, without prosecution, with accusation, without accusation ”.
 </p>
<p>
  In another moment of leaked audio, Cid states that “Alexandre de Moraes already has his sentence ready, I think this is the great truth. He already has his sentence ready. It's just waiting for a while. The moment he finds convenient, denounces everyone, the PGR [Attorney General of the Republic] accepts, accepts and he holds everyone. ” Finally, Lieutenant Colonel also hosted Moraes hides episodes of 2022: “I talked about that meeting of Alexandre de Moraes with the president, they were disconcerted, disconcerted. I said, ‘Do you want me to say?’ ”
 </p>
<p>
  In the audio, Lieutenant Colonel also made a point of talking about how was what was most damaged because of the 2022 coup articulation, almost as the one that risked the “cause” most: “I fucked the most was me. Who lost something else was me. No one lost career, no one lost financial life as I lost. Everyone was already four stars, had already reached the top, right? The president had pix of millions, was a millionaire, right? ”He said.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-audio">
<audio controls="" src="https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sequencia-01.mp3">
</audio>
</figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Mauro Cid loses, Bolsonaro wins
 </h4>
<p>
  The leakage of the audios, in which the whistleblower claims to have been pressured by the investigators and that the questions were biased, objectively reinforced the position of the far right and Bolsonaro's rightist allies. These seek to “burn” STF Minister Alexandre de Moraes as “partial” to conduct the inquiry. Whether or not it is true what Mauro Cid said, the fact is that the suspicion is already planted. This does not mean that the evidence is legally annulled now, but politically, a possible arrest warrant is fragile in the short term.
 </p>
<p>
  It draws attention, however, that Mauro Cid has gained absolutely nothing with this leak. Lieutenant Colonel got sick and passed out as he received the prison voice. On the contrary, Bolsonaro wins. Allies and Bolsonaro's legal defense celebrated the event, even calling him “license plate”.
 </p>
<p>
  It is amazing how, among scammers and fascists, disloyalty and betrayal flourish like Bambus after the rains: Mauro Cid, the whistleblower, was all betrayed by his interlocutor, who leaked the audio that hurt him seriously. Cid, however, cannot complain: had delivered information that incriminated Bolsonaro to get rid of the prison. These people surrender each other, regardless of whether they were old allies. Mauro Cid cheated on and was betrayed. As Shakespeare wrote, in
  <strong>

  According to information revealed by journalist Denise Assis, from Portal Brasil 247, the purpose of the former army commander, Júlio César Arruda, by positioning tanks in front of the pocket camp in the Army HQ on the night of January 8-thus preventing, thus, preventing, thus preventing The arrest of the "green chickens"-was to protect the daughter and wife of the former commander Eduardo Villas-Bôas. The decision was accepted by Luiz Inácio, who prevarious with Arruda.
 </p>
<p>
  It has been suspected for a long time that the camp in front of the HQ was used temporary for reactionary and family members who took part in the
  <em>
   bolster
  </em>
  From 8/1, and that the tanks served as protection for its departure before the entrance of the Military Police (PM) troops. At the time, the official justification that repercussions the most in the press was that the PM entrance was postponed to avoid a “blood bath” as there were armed “green chickens” in the camp that could react. However, this is not the real version of the facts.
 </p>
<p>
  The truth is that Army Commander Julio Cesar Arruda discovered the presence of Maria Aparecida and Ticiana Villas-Bôas in the camp and that they had participated in the invasion of the Praça dos Three Powers. The then army commander contacted Gustavo Henrique Dutra, Planalto's military commander, to set up the shielding of the armor at the entrance of the barracks and prevent the PM from entering. Dutra also received the task of talking to Luiz Inacio, informing him and convincing him to suspend the order. Dutra spoke first with General Gonçalves Dias, then Minister of GSI, and convinced him to pass to the agent. In the conversation, Dutra reported to Luiz Inácio the presence of Maria Aparecida and Ticiana, warned the president that there was a risk of upheaval if their arrest was made, since the figure of Villas-Bôas is unanimous in the barracks. Luiz Inácio, thus, accepted the order.
 </p>
<p>
  Maria Aparecida Villas-Bôas, wife of the former commander, was an extremely active figure in the articulations by the institutional rupture. She often visited camps, even hindering on one of the visits that Villas-Bôas was with her and went to one of the military summit to discuss the coup.
 </p>
<p>
  The facts revealed explain the degree of the military crisis in which the nation is still plunged. After all, if the simple arrest of family members of a former commander could untie a process of breaking hierarchy and discipline in the barracks, the only certainty we can have is that this same hierarchy and discipline are extremely fragile. And in fact, they are: the troops have not changed, nor the essentials of their command. Who can believe that Brazil is really safe from an institutional rupture, as the liberals and opportunists suggest?

  On the afternoon of March 20, a demonstration took place at the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice (TJRJ).

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  At the time, the worker was imprisoned two months in a prison in the municipality of São Gonçalo and is currently in provisional release. Diego's colleagues and relatives require the end of the judgment against the motorcycle taxi driver and denouncing the criminalization of the black, poor and peripheral people promoted by the old state.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration began at noon and was attended by friends and family of Diego, as well as democratic organizations such as the Brazilian Center for Solidarity to Peoples (Cebraspo). At the time, the protesters raised posters and echoed phrases like
  <strong>
   Justice for Diego
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Mototaxi is not a bandit, stirred him messed with me
  </strong>
<strong>
   Worker is not a bandit, it was the PM who killed Amarildo
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  During the interventions, family members denounced the racist character of the police in the constant arbitrary arrests and operations against favela workers, pointing out that Diego's case is no exception, but a rule in a country where 44.5% of prisoners They have not yet been tried, according to data from the National Council of Justice (CNJ) in 2022.
 </p>
<p>
  Protesters also denounced the two weights and two measures used by the Old State Court. While suing, arresting, and criminalizing thousands of innocent workers, it acquit and free the military police who kill the people in the slums, as recently occurred with the acquittal of the police who murdered the worker Claudia Ferreira.
 </p>
<p>
  The judgment of Diego's case was postponed to April 1 at 2 pm due to the non -attendance of police officers who are part of the prosecution. The family invites everyone to participate in another act that will take place on this day at 12 noon in front of the Court.

   NOVA DEMOCRACIA REPORTS
  </a>
  that on Tuesday, March 19, the trial of the request for acquittal of the 23 political activists persecuted for their participation in the 2013 and 2014 demonstrations took place at the Court in Rio de Janeiro.
 </p>
<p>
  The trial lasted around 20 minutes and unanimously approved the acquittal of the activists. Outside the court, popular class movements, democratic entities and associations gathered to denounce the political persecution and demand the acquittal of the 23 activists persecuted by the old State for 10 years.
 </p>
<p>
  At the event, in addition to celebrating the result of the trial, speeches were also made against the criminalization of the popular struggle currently underway, defending the people’s right to struggle for their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The case against the 23 began in 2014, with accusations of “gang formation” and “corruption of minors”. The activists were sentenced to sentences ranging from 5 to 7 years in prison. The accusations and arrests linked to this process are part of the campaign of persecution and criminalization of the popular struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  It is worth highlighting that the criminalization of activists and young people who took to the streets to protest also included the participation of the press monopoly, which painted the young fighters as “terrorists” and “vandals”.
 </p>
<p>
  Igor Mendes, among others was imprisoned. He served almost 7 months. Several other people had to remain underground to escape the waves of arrests that were taking place.
 </p>
<p>
  During these 10 years of struggling against the absurd process, the people’s lawyers managed to completely prove the complete farce behind the accusations, which was not supported by evidence but by “testimonies” from undercover agents and other illegalities. that made up a process full of gross flaws.
 </p>
<p>
  The acquittal represents a political victory not only for the activists directly affected but also for all those who struggle, especially the youth, who dared to stand up in the heroic days of 2013 and 2014 against oppression and exploitation of the people. The outcome is also important due to the given current national situation, marked by a profound reactionarization of the State, which has been creating new laws and legal mechanisms to criminalize popular struggle and the right to demonstrate.

As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2.

The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information.

In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6.

The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2.

Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

"Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/><br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION Article 53   Initiation of an investigation 1. The Prosecutor shall, having evaluated the information made available to him or her, initiate an investigation  unless he or she determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed under this Statute. In deciding  whether to initiate an investigation, the Prosecutor shall consider whether:  (a) The information available to the Prosecutor provides a reasonable basis to believe that a crime within  the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being committed;  (b) The case is or would be admissible under article 17; and  (c) Taking into account the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims, there are nonetheless  substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice. If the Prosecutor determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed and his or her determination is  based solely on subparagraph (c) above, he or she shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  2. If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3. (a) At the request of the State making a referral under article 14 or the Security Council under article 13,  paragraph (b), the Pre-Trial Chamber may review a decision of the Prosecutor under paragraph 1 or  2  not to proceed and mayrequest the Prosecutor to reconsider that decision.  (b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1. The Prosecutor shall:  (a) In order to establish the truth, extend the investigation to cover all facts and evidence relevant to an  assessment of whether there is criminal responsibility under this Statute, and, in doing so, investigate  incriminating and exonerating circumstances equally;  (b) Take appropriate measures to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court, and in doing so, respect the interests and personal circumstances of victims  and witnesses, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and take into  account the nature of the crime, in particular where it involves sexual violence, gender violence or  violence against children; and  (c) Fully respect the rights of persons arising under this Statute. 2.

Article 55   Rights of persons during an investigation 1. In respect of an investigation under this Statute, a person:  (a) Shall not be compelled to incriminate himself or herself or to confess guilt;  (b) Shall not be subjected to any form of coercion, duress or threat, to torture or to any other form of  cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  (c) Shall, if questioned in a language other than a language the person fully understands and speaks,  have, free of any cost, the assistance of a competent interpreter and such translations as are necessary  to meet the requirements of fairness; and  (d) Shall not be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention, and shall not be deprived of his or her liberty  except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established in this Statute. 2. Where there are grounds to believe that a person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  and that person is about to be questioned either by the Prosecutor, or by national authorities pursuant to  a request made under Part 9, that person shall also have the following rights of which he or she shall be  informed prior to being questioned:  (a) To be informed, prior to being questioned, that there are grounds to believe that he or she has  committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (b) To remain silent, without such silence being a consideration in the determination of guilt or innocence;  (c) To have legal assistance of the person's choosing, or, if the person does not have legal assistance, to  have legal assistance assigned to him or her, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and  without payment by the person in any such case if the person does not have sufficient means to pay  for it; and  (d) To be questioned in the presence of counsel unless the person has voluntarily waived his or her right  to counsel. Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/><br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by modifying or adding  to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial notice of them.  7.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations.

The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4.

Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.  (b) Where, however, the request from the Court concerns information, property or persons which are  subject to the control of a third State or an international organization by virtue of an international  agreement, the requested States shall so inform the Court and the Court shall direct its request to the  third State or international organization.  10.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  On Thursday, last week, a dispute on land between people from Okuama, Ughelli South, and Okoloba, Bomadi, in Nigeria’s southern state of Delta, took place. The armed forces of the old State tried to intervene but received what they did not expect.

  The soldiers were responding to a call during fighting between some people connected to two rival factions of the feudal landownership. According to local media reports, there have been clashes repeatedly over land ownership in recent weeks, leaving several people dead. One man was abducted during that fighting, with the Nigerian military unable to get the man released.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not unusual that soldiers are sent to resolve conflicts in countryside, which often erupt over land or compensation for oil spills by energy companies in many Delta state communities.
 </p>
<p>
  But this time things went somehow different than usual. It is
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/top-stories/nigeria-16-soldiers-killed-in-delta-state-community-clashes/ar-BB1k5gJ4">
   reported
  </a>
  that when the soldiers from the 181 Amphibious Battalion, responded to a distress call and appeared at the scene, they were surrounded by the local youth and killed at the spot. Among the dead were a commanding officer, two majors, one captain and 12 soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  An investigation has been opened and “a few arrests have been made while steps [are] in place to unravel the motive behind the attack,” Defense Headquarters spokesman Brigadier General Tukur Gusau said in a statement.
 </p>
<p>
  It
  <a href="https://www.herald.ng/residents-flee-as-military-recovers-15-soldiers-bodies-in-delta/">
   has been reported
  </a>
  , that the masses have now fled the area when the army was sent in to recover the mutilated corpses and to take revenge – houses were set ablaze.
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   This incident shows once more the hatred the masses feel towards the ruling big-landlord-bureaucratic system and their repressive forces and on the other hand the impotence of these to prevail the old order, as an expression of the deep crisis imperialism is sinking in.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions.

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3.

The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2.

The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5. The decision shall be in writing and shall contain a full and reasoned statement of the Trial Chamber's  findings on the evidence and conclusions. The Trial Chamber shall issue one decision. When there is no  unanimity, the Trial Chamber's decision shall contain the views of the majority and the minority. The  decision or a summary thereof shall be delivered in open court. Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3. Where paragraph 2 applies, any representations under article 75 shall be heard during the further hearing  referred to in paragraph 2 and, if necessary, during any additional hearing.  4. The sentence shall be pronounced in public and, wherever possible, in the presence of the accused.<br/><br/>38 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 7.   PENALTIES Article 77   Applicable penalties 1. Subject to article 110, the Court may impose one of the following penalties on a person convicted of a crime  referred to in article 5 of this Statute:  (a) Imprisonment for a specified number of years, which may not exceed a maximum of 30 years; or  (b) A term of life imprisonment when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual  circumstances of the convicted person. 2. In addition to imprisonment, the Court may order:  (a) A fine under the criteria provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) A forfeiture of proceeds, property and assets derived directly or indirectly from that crime, without  prejudice to the rights of bona fide third parties. Article 78   Determination of the sentence 1.

The Court may deduct any time otherwise spent in  detention in connection with conduct underlying the crime.  3. When a person has been convicted of more than one crime, the Court shall pronounce a sentence for each  crime and a joint sentence specifying the total period of imprisonment. This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2. The Court may order money and other property collected through fines or forfeiture to be transferred, by  order of the Court, to the Trust Fund.  3. The Trust Fund shall be managed according to criteria to be determined by the Assembly of States Parties.  Article 80   Non-prejudice to national application of penalties and national laws Nothing in this Part affects the application by States of penalties prescribed by their national law, nor the law of  States which do not provide for penalties prescribed in this Part. <br/><br/>39 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 8.   APPEAL AND REVISION Article 81   Appeal against decision of acquittal or conviction or against sentence 1. A decision under article 74 may be appealed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence as  follows:  (a) The Prosecutor may make an appeal on any of the following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact, or  (iii) Error of law;  (b) The convicted person, or the Prosecutor on that person's behalf, may make an appeal on any of the  following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact,  (iii) Error of law, or  (iv) Any other ground that affects the fairness or reliability of the proceedings or decision. 2. (a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

Either party may appeal any of the following decisions in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence:  (a) A decision with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility;  (b) A decision granting or denying release of the person being investigated or prosecuted;  (c) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under article 56, paragraph 3;  (d) A decision that involves an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of  the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and for which, in the opinion of the Pre-Trial or Trial  Chamber, an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.<br/><br/>40 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3. If in an appeal against sentence the Appeals Chamber finds that the sentence is disproportionate to the  crime, it may vary the sentence in accordance with Part 7.  4. The judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall be taken by a majority of the judges and shall be delivered  in open court. The judgement shall state the reasons on which it is based. When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at the time of the  accused's death who has been given express written instructions from the accused to bring such a claim, or  the Prosecutor on the person's behalf, may apply to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of  conviction or sentence on the grounds that:  (a) New evidence has been discovered that:  (i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially  attributable to the party making application; and  (ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have  resulted in a different verdict; (b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the  conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;  (c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has  committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to  justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46. 2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

(c) The requested State may, on its own motion or at the request of the Prosecutor, subsequently consent  to the disclosure of such documents or information. They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j). Article 95   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of an admissibility challenge Where there is an admissibility challenge under consideration by the Court pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  requested State may postpone the execution of a request under this Part pending a determination by the Court,  unless the Court has specifically ordered that the Prosecutor may pursue the collection of such evidence pursuant  to article 18 or 19. Article 96   Contents of request for other forms of assistance under article 93 1. A request for other forms of assistance referred to in article 93 shall be made in writing. In urgent cases, a  request may be made by any medium capable of delivering a written record, provided that the request shall  be confirmed through the channel provided for in article 87, paragraph 1 (a).  2. The request shall, as applicable, contain or be supported by the following:  (a) A concise statement of the purpose of the request and the assistance sought, including the legal basis  and the grounds for the request;  (b) As much detailed information as possible about the location or identification of any person or place  that must be found or identified in order for the assistance sought to be provided;  (c) A concise statement of the essential facts underlying the request;  (d) The reasons for and details of any procedure or requirement to be followed;  (e) Such information as may be required under the law of the requested State in order to execute the  request; and  (f) Any other information relevant in order for the assistance sought to be provided. 3.

During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/><br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  on the war in Sudan portraying an initial analysis of the circumstances of the outbreak of the war.
 </p>
<p>
  Nearly one year afterwards the situation is sharpening. It is
  <a href="https://monde-diplomatique.de/artikel/!5987031">
   reported
  </a>
  , that the war-actions dramatically increased, due to massive arming of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) by the United Arab Emirates on the one hand and the “government’s” Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) by Egypt. It is
  <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/03/sudans-forgotten-war-new-diplomatic-push-needed">
   said
  </a>
  , that around eight million people are displaced inside the country as well as being forced to fled into neighboring countries additional to around 3 million refugees resulting from previous conflicts. Half the territory is controlled by either the RSF or the SAF. The government fled the capital Khartoum to Port Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  Negotiation attempts failed or resulted in non-lasting cease-fires. Since these failures international organization focus on the supply with humanitarian aid.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the battle is for centered around El Fasher, the capital of the region North Darfur, after the RSF was able to conquer Nyala, al-Dshunaina and Zalingei three of five regional capitals in Darfur region. In El Fasher around 1.5 million people live, one third being internal refugees. The outcomes of the battle on El Fasher seems to become a turning point in the ongoing war.

<p>
  While the burden lies on the masses of the peoples in Sudan, foreigners are profiting. In this aspects one can consider Egypt as the Yankees handyman, while the UAE seems to be a Russian proxy in Sudan, as most

  do.
 </p>
<p>
  In this sense the development of “DP World” is noteworthy. It was founded 25 years ago by the UAE state monopoly “Dubai World” as a maritime transport company. DP World started in 2016 to construct and run ports in Eastern Africa. First in Somaliland and Puntland, then in Senegal, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In October 2023 DP World took over the port of Daressalam in Tanzania for 250 million US-Dollar.
 </p>
<p>
  The UAE via its DP World was heading for the same port as the Russians – Port Sudan. So the UAE and the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group made up a joint-venture. Wagner transported arms paid for by the UAE with its troops in the Central African Republic to the RSF in Sudan. Since the Prigozhin incident and the restructuring of Wagner – we
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/02/26/two-years-of-russian-war-of-aggression-against-ukraine/">

  </a>
  – things became even more complicated. According to Le Mode Diplomatique today two different Russian groups are involved in arming the RSF. But the Kremlin is striving to overcome these issues by its new Africa Corps.
 </p>
<p>
  Due to the difficult situation with Wagner the UAE brought Libyan Chalifa Haftar in to play. Haftar organized air cargo from Bengasi to North-Western-Darfur. Additionally air-drops of weapons with parachutes were delivered.

  relations with the UAE were at an all-time high during his first visit to the Middle East since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Putin praised cooperation between the two countries as he met President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi in early December 2023, describing the UAE as “Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.” For the UAE, the strong ties with Russia is a “calculated risk” it is willing to take, a top UAE official

  On the other side the SAF are supplied via the sea to their residence in Port Sudan by Egypt. Egypt also directly intervened in the conflict, bombarding a Nile-River-Bridge in Khartoum in August 2023. Hundreds of Egyptian soldiers have been captured by the RSF and bombings of RSF positions by Egyptian fighter jets are reported,

<p>
  In this situation the scenario tends towards a complete collapse of central government, what will boost the current explosive situation at the Horn of Africa even more. On the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, the UN Security Council, aware of this situation, adopted a UK-drafted resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan during the month of Ramadan, a sustainable resolution to the conflict through dialogue, compliance with international humanitarian law and unhindered humanitarian access.
 </p>
<p>
  The UN Secretary-General, the UN Security Council, the African Union, and the League of Arab States joined forces to call for this Ramadan truce but Ramadan has started with further fierce fighting. Ali Karti, the Secretary-General of Sudan’s Islamic Movement has now announced that a truce with the RSF will never be accepted.
 </p>
<p>
  On top of the death and misery the war itself causes Sudan is on track to becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis, with around 18 million people already facing acute food insecurity, according to a
  <a href="https://sudantribune.com/article283302/">
   report
  </a>
  by the United Nations. 220,000 severely malnourished children could reportedly die in the upcoming months if they do not receive urgent assistance. A total of some 3.7 million children suffer from malnutrition in Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  The perspective is quite horrible. The UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan is only 4 per cent funded. Both RSF and SAF used hunger as a weapon of war. The RSF has looted humanitarian warehouses and besieged cities. The SAF-controlled Humanitarian Aid Commission has systematically banned movement of lifesaving aid to RSF-controlled areas.
 </p>
<p>
  The recent fighting is very likely to damage the spring harvest, which will increase the hunger even more. Also adequate medical treatment is seldom since prices of medics sky-rocketed by 600 per cent.
 </p>
<p>
  The armed conflict in Sudan, driven forward by the Imperialist puppeteers, will continue to great even more disorder in a region tarnished by war.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.  Article 10 Nothing in this Part shall be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of  international law for purposes other than this Statute.  Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/><br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/><br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions.

Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2.

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided.

A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2.

If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5. The decision shall be in writing and shall contain a full and reasoned statement of the Trial Chamber's  findings on the evidence and conclusions. The Trial Chamber shall issue one decision. When there is no  unanimity, the Trial Chamber's decision shall contain the views of the majority and the minority. The  decision or a summary thereof shall be delivered in open court. Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3. Where paragraph 2 applies, any representations under article 75 shall be heard during the further hearing  referred to in paragraph 2 and, if necessary, during any additional hearing.  4. The sentence shall be pronounced in public and, wherever possible, in the presence of the accused.<br/><br/>38 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 7.   PENALTIES Article 77   Applicable penalties 1. Subject to article 110, the Court may impose one of the following penalties on a person convicted of a crime  referred to in article 5 of this Statute:  (a) Imprisonment for a specified number of years, which may not exceed a maximum of 30 years; or  (b) A term of life imprisonment when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual  circumstances of the convicted person. 2. In addition to imprisonment, the Court may order:  (a) A fine under the criteria provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) A forfeiture of proceeds, property and assets derived directly or indirectly from that crime, without  prejudice to the rights of bona fide third parties. Article 78   Determination of the sentence 1.

The Court may deduct any time otherwise spent in  detention in connection with conduct underlying the crime.  3. When a person has been convicted of more than one crime, the Court shall pronounce a sentence for each  crime and a joint sentence specifying the total period of imprisonment. This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2. The Court may order money and other property collected through fines or forfeiture to be transferred, by  order of the Court, to the Trust Fund.  3. The Trust Fund shall be managed according to criteria to be determined by the Assembly of States Parties.  Article 80   Non-prejudice to national application of penalties and national laws Nothing in this Part affects the application by States of penalties prescribed by their national law, nor the law of  States which do not provide for penalties prescribed in this Part. <br/><br/>39 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 8.   APPEAL AND REVISION Article 81   Appeal against decision of acquittal or conviction or against sentence 1. A decision under article 74 may be appealed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence as  follows:  (a) The Prosecutor may make an appeal on any of the following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact, or  (iii) Error of law;  (b) The convicted person, or the Prosecutor on that person's behalf, may make an appeal on any of the  following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact,  (iii) Error of law, or  (iv) Any other ground that affects the fairness or reliability of the proceedings or decision. 2. (a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

Either party may appeal any of the following decisions in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence:  (a) A decision with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility;  (b) A decision granting or denying release of the person being investigated or prosecuted;  (c) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under article 56, paragraph 3;  (d) A decision that involves an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of  the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and for which, in the opinion of the Pre-Trial or Trial  Chamber, an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.<br/><br/>40 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3. If in an appeal against sentence the Appeals Chamber finds that the sentence is disproportionate to the  crime, it may vary the sentence in accordance with Part 7.  4. The judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall be taken by a majority of the judges and shall be delivered  in open court. The judgement shall state the reasons on which it is based. When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at the time of the  accused's death who has been given express written instructions from the accused to bring such a claim, or  the Prosecutor on the person's behalf, may apply to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of  conviction or sentence on the grounds that:  (a) New evidence has been discovered that:  (i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially  attributable to the party making application; and  (ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have  resulted in a different verdict; (b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the  conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;  (c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has  committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to  justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46. 2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/><br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

(c) The requested State may, on its own motion or at the request of the Prosecutor, subsequently consent  to the disclosure of such documents or information. They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j). Article 95   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of an admissibility challenge Where there is an admissibility challenge under consideration by the Court pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  requested State may postpone the execution of a request under this Part pending a determination by the Court,  unless the Court has specifically ordered that the Prosecutor may pursue the collection of such evidence pursuant  to article 18 or 19. Article 96   Contents of request for other forms of assistance under article 93 1. A request for other forms of assistance referred to in article 93 shall be made in writing. In urgent cases, a  request may be made by any medium capable of delivering a written record, provided that the request shall  be confirmed through the channel provided for in article 87, paragraph 1 (a).  2. The request shall, as applicable, contain or be supported by the following:  (a) A concise statement of the purpose of the request and the assistance sought, including the legal basis  and the grounds for the request;  (b) As much detailed information as possible about the location or identification of any person or place  that must be found or identified in order for the assistance sought to be provided;  (c) A concise statement of the essential facts underlying the request;  (d) The reasons for and details of any procedure or requirement to be followed;  (e) Such information as may be required under the law of the requested State in order to execute the  request; and  (f) Any other information relevant in order for the assistance sought to be provided. 3.

During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/><br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4. If no State is designated under paragraph 1, the sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a prison  facility made available by the host State, in accordance with the conditions set out in the headquarters  agreement referred to in article 3, paragraph 2. In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a  sentence of imprisonment shall be borne by the Court.  Article 104   Change in designation of State of enforcement 1. The Court may, at any time, decide to transfer a sentenced person to a prison of another State.  2. A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

    Now we should be registered for short -time work, which means that we are now getting ten percent less wages. The news stood everywhere that we would supposedly do this on a voluntary basis, but now we have to sign a company agreement. The news also stood that there are no dismissals. Nevertheless, 100 colleagues who were in temporary work had to go. In total, we are 1,000 colleagues who now get ten percent less wages. Our rent, purchasing and insurance are not 10 percent cheaper!

   It was a successful, militant and mass demonstration. Which has shown that the answer to the issue of persecution can and should take cinematic and central characteristics. After all, the government and the system are escalating their attack, with the new Criminal Code, the opening of the debate on the defrost of the Chrysochoid law on demonstrations, with the stroke of squatters and new persecution of trade unionists and militants.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
  The race continues. After all, at the end of the demonstration was the appointment with the new trade union meeting &amp; amp; Motion-Collectives-Neighborhood Movements (Tuesday 26/3 at 18:30 in the 3rd GEL Piraeus- Mavromichali 14-) that will decide the new steps to take.

<p>
  On Thursday, 21/3, a gathering of a complaint by the prosecution of the prosecution of teachers for their political and trade union action in Piraeus and other cities of all 49 students of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki took place in the center of Heraklion on Thursday 21/3.
 </p>
<p>
  As a racing moves of teachers, we proposed to the interventions in Primary and Secondary Education to invite the same day to Heraklion on this issue. We even suggested that we meet on Friday 15/3 to organize this concentration as best possible. This meeting was not made for various reasons. ELME not only did not participate but not even a resolution. The arguments of the SYNEK, the PEK and PAME were not only unacceptable but also ridiculous.
 </p>
<p>
  Eventually without particular fermentation and substantial intervention in schools, the gathering was made. Banners were involved in the racing movements of teachers, the left intervention, the left -wing concentration and the class course. Dozens of teachers and workers also responded. It was set up microphone, hundreds of notices were shared and there was a very good climate in the world's response. But in the end we couldn't make a demonstration.
 </p>
<p>
  We believe that our weaknesses and the possibilities that have been quite well in this mobilization must be concerned with all the forces we participated in. If we move more decisively in the next period for the serious issue of persecution (and not only) the result will be much better.
 </p>

 This day is established by the "EU" UN as World Day of Happiness. Indeed, so much concern about the essential bliss of mankind is not based. We will bend over the overweight. Is the excess of the agony of the good samaritas that we will put it? Rather, let's take the lead of the leader (at least in the Balkan south) Mitsotakis, to raise the country from 64th (out of 143 in total) of the international rankings, a little higher.
 <br>
<br>
 Of course, no matter how hard the blessed one (because some are grateful for him), unlikely to approach Israeli's jealous (estimates of the genocide) !! But his effort is rewarded, inquisitively ending.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Thus, the bullshit bullshit crushes in the wood and capture students in order to permanently lock the last success of establishing private high schools. As a consequence of which the people will be paid very much in the sea of "happiness" for the studies of their children (which they will not be able to) very much tuition in public universities.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Equally "surrounded" and at all, young people will make their way of life "leisure" with privatized and modernized trains. They will offer militant males their blood in a vortex of "rejoicing" to any war fronts the national prestige and nationalist task of embraced (submissive) with the imperialist American macabre designs. Just as the ancestors did "glorious" in Crimea, Sangari and Korea.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In a "blessing" parasite they will also conquer the heavenly eternity by saying goodbye to the futile world of matter (which the Christian bastard of society enjoys in mythical dosages) in the fire of the eye (achievement not directly of the current government) downpour. Companion will of course have the immortal (by religion) soul of the "careless" killed workers in employer hell. Where, with unstoppable "excitement", the Pentecostal Biologist is exhausted for the productive development of the place by fighting the daily battle with the non -capitalist and rather extraterrestrial monster of precision.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It is sufficient to not be seduced by demagogic, mischievous sirens, the Director of the oligarchy, painfully obtaining the popular "euphoria". Which stems from the deprivation of galloping policy of the welfare state of the welfare. With a "horrible" consequence instead of the "delicious" appeal to afternoon surgeries, the people will be forced to search for ... free treatment in hospitals and always at the expense of sacred resource savings. That is to say, the sacrifices for the purchase of defenders (which defense without introversion defense is spreading to the Red Sea) of the "pacifist" of death and a sense of security ... Syrian or Iraqi. Such, even granite confidence, utterly steadfast by the "jokes" of the threatening Putin Holocaust.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The "fascinating climate of ecstasy and care" of the people is enriched and completed with the hedonistic discourse of twelve -year -old girls, mixed with "gratitude" to their stapler. Who, with the bullshit of the impunity of the (bourgeois) law, issues them "altruistic" to the perverts, to win the needy girls "pleasantly" for living.
 <br/>
<br/>
 It is not enough that the Earth's ubiquitous sovereignty of capital and imperialists becomes a genuine nightmare the survival of the workers' masses, rather than we are at the same time unstoppable. They establish days of celebration and baptize each of the 365 witnessing days of the year under imaginative names. In a globe of hunger, pain, horror and clamor.
 <br/>
<br/>
 You hear happiness there. Where and by what criteria do the natural and moral perpetrators of the greatest crimes of the universe count it? In Gaza and Ukraine crematoriums or nearly nine million dead on the planet on the planet of acute starvation? Is it with hundreds of refugees at the bottom of Pylos or the 35,000 memories of the pandemic -only pandemic in Greece?
 <br/>
<br/>
 The peoples a single resurrected celebration should plan every day and moment. That of resistance to the barbarism and hypocrisy of the system. It is impossible to celebrate at the same time all together, bosses and slaves. Or the tyrants will feast on the unmistakable (officially) paradise, causing the masses of suffocating, despair, brutal repression and warlike masses or the peoples will breathe free, serene, creative, hopeful.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The pleasure of the few footpaths ruthlessly to satisfy the majority interests. While the happiness of many presupposes the defeat and crash of the class opponents of a handful of exploiters. Nothing in between is meant.
 <br/>

 The Minister of Education of Germany says schools must prepare students for the possibility of war, at the same time that the local bourgeois political system is dancing to the rhythm of June. European Council President Charles Michelle proclaims that "if he wants peace, Europe needs to be prepared for war" and that we need to "go into war economy" while at the same time, the long -haired delusions and lies for lies for lies. The "Europe of the Peoples" are re -employed by the rulers to drag their peoples to the upcoming electoral farce. So here, domestic starry is getting ready to wear the "democratic" of the costumes, at the same time as plans to dress the world of work and youth in variations whenever required.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  The parties concerned have agreed to continue the four-party Socialist Front of Nepal.
 </p>
<p>
  Top leaders of the CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand and the CPN (Maoist Centre), all participants in the Socialist Front of Nepal, held a meeting at the Prime Minister’s Residence, Baluwatar, on Friday morning. Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma, spokesperson for the Chand-led CPN, said that it had been agreed to continue the Socialist Front and advance the front’s programs.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same meeting, it was decided to try to get the CPN-UML to participate in the Socialist Front of Nepal. “From the beginning, our party was in favor of including other parties including the UML in the Socialist Front. However, due to the previous power coalition, UML was not accepting that,” Bishwakarma said. “Now, the environment has become easier after the change of power. Since they are also in the government, there has been a discussion about getting them to participate in the Front.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the changed situation, the parties have become hopeful that UML will participate in the Front. For this, a team including Chand, who is also the coordinator of the Socialist Front, held a two-hour conversation with UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli on Thursday. Bishwakarma said that Oli appeared positive. “He is positive. However, it is necessary to discuss some issues further,” he said.
 </p>
<p>
  “In today’s meeting, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav have been given the responsibility to further communicate with Oli,” Bishwakarma said.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  As we have already denounced (*), the Egyptian regime of Al Sisi is making a fence in the Sinai desert to lock the Palestinians on the run from Gaza, and thus facilitate the "ethnic cleaning" by Israel, in exchange for funding of the Ill.
 </p>
<p>
  The Egyptian regime is dominated by the military, who are also among the major capitalists of the country. "Pharaonic" affected business, such as the construction of the new capital (with enormous profits for themselves and for friends), have also magnified the debt of the state and now the only payment of interest on the debt weighs for over 10% of the GDP. Solution: print money, then create inflation, that is, cut the purchasing power of wages to maintain the profits of the owners, private, state and military.
  <br>
  In September 2023 the inflation had reached 40%, that is, the purchasing power of the already miserable wages and salaries had undergone a 40%cut.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Fearing the discontent for hunger wages also among public employees, the government has decreed the increase in the minimum wage from 4,000 to 6,000 Egyptian pounds (at the current gearbox, today 120 euros per month). For private employees, however, the minimum wage was brought to only 3,500.
  <br>
  In January, to workers who protested for the low wages, at Sisi he had the shamelessness of responding: “We don't eat? Let's eat. We don't drink? We drink, and everything works [and here he had made an obscene, sprinkling, comparison with the condition of the Palestinians deliberately hungry and thirsty by the Zionist state - ed.]. Are things expensive and some are not available? So?".
 </br></p>
<p>
<b>
   The response of the workers of the largest Egyptian factory, Misr di Mahalla al-Kubra's textile complex in the Nile delta, which has more than a century of history and struggles, arrived on February 22.
  </b>
<b>
   Discaning the protest slogans went on strike in 3,700.
  </b>
  Despite the intervention of the guards to prevent them from accessing the Central Piazzale, and the descenda in the field of the official union against the strike, the strike, supported by an independent union, has extended to at least 7 thousand workers.
  <br>
  The response of the masters and the government was: stick and carrot. Minimum salary at 6,000 le (a 70%increase), arrest of 13 "leader" of the strike (source: Labourstart), of which two still held on March 13, are also threatened with dismissal due to unjustified absence.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Evidently masters and government count on the continuation of inflation (still at 31% in January 2024), which will remain the increases, and the arrests are a warning to anyone, in Mahalla or elsewhere, came to mind to return to the struggle.
  <br/>
  But letting the strike continues without concessions seemed too dangerous to the government: he would have risked a generalized explosion because he knows that the strong increase in the cost of living has increased the pressure between the workers.
  <br/>
  An explosion that could connect to popular support to the Palestinian cause that is in Egypt, although the military regime does everything that may not to show it, and to the more general discontent for the heavy working and life conditions of millions of proletarians.
 </p>
<p>
  On the same days, in fact, hundreds of workers of a large construction company owned by the billionaire Talaat Moustafa, in companies with the Saudi family of the Bin Laden, fell into struggle.
 </p>
 They protested against the dismissal of permanent workers (especially those who have undergone accidents at work or have fallen sick) to hire workers with precarious contracts, and asking for the payment of arrears, a wage increase for caravan, safety measures and devices protection on construction sites, greater health coverage.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  In this case it is significant that the company guards, who a week earlier had intervened to repress a protest of the employees, a few days later they refused to enter service, complaining about being paid the 3000 (60 euros) per month For 14 hours of work a day, and have obtained an increase.
 </p>
<p>
  The Talaat Moustafa group, which has become a giant with orders for the new capital, is now participating in companies with the ADQ of the Emirates group in a 35 billion dollar project for the construction of a tourist city on the Mediterranean coast, on land privatized by military.
 </p>
<p>
  These episodes of workers are indicative of a social temperature that is going up to Egypt as in other countries of the Middle East and which could lead to new explosions if the economic crisis will worsen, in connection also with the anger caused by the genocidal war of Israel against The population of Gaza.
  <br/>
  It is no coincidence that the IMF offers Al-Sisi billions in exchange for work dirty with collaboration with Israel; While on their part Meloni and Von del Leyen promise 7.4 billion euros to Egypt because he does the equally dirty work of retaining emigrants to Europe, as well as for other lucrative business.
 </p>
<p>
  We allow ourselves to repeat it: the only true friends of the Palestinians attacked and oppressed by Israel to Gaza and in West Bank are the workers and the exploited of the region and the world, not the Arab capitalist governments who exploit and repress their workers and are ready to do Business by collaborating with the imperialist metropolis in the repression of Palestinians and migrants.

   Thousands of workers strike for the increase in wages in the Ghazl al-Mahalla factory
  </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  - Di Beesan Kassab, 25 Febbraio 2024
 </p>
<p>
  Ghazl Al-Mahalla's workers are on strike to obtain higher wages and more equipped bonuses.
 </p>
<p>
  About 7,000 workers met on Saturday morning in the central square of the Ghazl al-Mahalla industrial complex for a strike that has already lasted for three days.
 </p>
<p>
  They ask that their daily meal is increased to 30 the [= 0.57 euros], raising a choir in which the amount is said to barely cover "the price of a liter of milk".
 </p>
<p>
  They also ask for the application of higher wages, referring to a recent wage increase for the public sector based on instructions by President Abdel Fattoh Al-Sisi, in the midst of an inflationary wave that has raised the cost of living at national level . In other slogans, workers asked: "Where is Sisi's decision?".
 </p>
<p>
  The mega-phabbrica of public property uses tens of thousands of people in the sectors of spinning, textile and medical cotton, as well as a power plant on a huge area of land in Mahalla al-Kubra, in the Governorate of Gharbiya.
 </p>
<p>
  Until Sunday, the negotiations of workers with the parent company have failed, said the center for unions and services to workers in a release released on Saturday evening. The meeting was attended by a representative of the Presidency, of the Labor Office, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the President of the General Union of Filaure and Weaving.
 </p>
<p>
  Several men who work in the company were held on Saturday by the National Security Agency after being summoned to be interrogated by the safety body together with some workers, said Ctws, without specifying the number of prisoners.
 </p>
<p>
  The workers launched the strike on Thursday [February 22], they told Mada Masr, starting in the prevalence of female clothing factories, which historically were at the forefront of several famous strikes of the company.
 </p>
<p>
  Hanan*, supervisor of a clothing factory, told Mada Masr that the workers of his building began to mark slogans, finally interrupting the work while the songs spread from one factory to another.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the security staff sealed the exits to prevent women from pouring into the central square of the complex, known as Piazza Talaat Harb. This safety measure was also applied to the power plant, according to Abdullah* who works there.
 </p>
<p>
  The security staff unlocked the gates of the factory around 15.00 on Thursday, half an hour before the end of the morning round, to make sure the workers left the premises and did not meet inside, said Hanan.
 </p>
<p>
  The company's workers described the low wages as a cause of dissatisfaction.
 </p>
<p>
  The cost of living has increased throughout the country, with an inflation that will exceed 30% in 2024. A recent "presidential package", which will be launched starting from March, provides for an increase in the minimum wage for the 4,000 public sector At 6,000 per month, with increases ranging from 1,000 to 1,200 per various job categories.
 </p>
<p>
  Although it is owned by the state, the Misr Spinning and Weiving Company, which owns Ghazl al-Mahalla, does not fall within the context of the presidential package, told Mada Masr a source of the Ministry of Finance.
 </p>
<p>
  The wages of the company are instead guided by the decisions of the National Council for Salari, which last October raised the minimum wage of the private sector to 3,500 le.
 </p>
<p>
  But the increase in October did not serve to contrast the reduction of purchasing power caused by inflation. After more than 25 years of service, Abdel Aziz* told Mada Masr that his total gain does not exceed 4,000 a month. The figure is equivalent to about $ 130 at the official exchange rate, or about 80 dollars at the rate of the market parallel to the time we write.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdullah said that his salary is 4,200 Lee after 33 years of work with the company. Hanan, who is approaching the pension, receives a salary of about 6,200 he.
 </p>
<p>
  Several sources of work of the company said that days before the strike, Gharbiya governor had made a series of visits to inspect a convoy that provides subsidized assets to the company's workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdel Aziz added that during Wednesday's visit, the Governor inspected a medical convoy that supplies the workers and "a worker told the Governor that his salary does not exceed 3500 le".
 </p>
<p>
  According to a declaration of the Ctws published on Saturday, the workers now ask that the minimum salary is brought to 6,000 le, with wage increases based on the seniority of service and a reduction of tax appropriations.
 </p>
<p>
  They also ask that their daily allowance for meals increased to 30 le, for a total of 900 per month instead of the current 210 per month, with a song circulating during the strike in which it was stated that the amount covers a barely "the price of a liter of milk".
 </p>
<p>
  The Ctws declaration of Saturday [February 24] stressed that the members of the company's official trade union committee, affiliated to the Egyptian union federation aligned to the state, tried to dissuade workers from the strike and to intimidate them, but were expelled from the square .
 </p>
<p>
  A prominent figure of the company's official trade union committee declared on Thursday in Mada Masr, on condition of anonymity, that the committee "prefers negotiation to the strike, but supports workers' requests".
 </p>
<p>
  Ghazl Al-Mahalla acted as a catalyst in late 2006 for a rebirth of the union action at national level, when a strike of tens of thousands of workers in the factory reverberated in a movement of similar strikes in other factories in the country.

  Geneva - March 6, 2024
 </p>
<p>
  In a worrying development, the national security of Gharbia, in Egypt, would have retained at least five employees of the renowned textile company Ghazl El-Mahalla, despite the workers' decision to disperse their strike on February 29, 2024.
  <br/>
  The employees started the strike to request the application of the minimum wage.
 </p>
<p>
  Among the prisoners are Wael Abu Zuwayed and Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, currently held at the national security office for so much. They are added to three other workers, Sabah Ali Al-Qattan, Muhammad Al-Attar and Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, also detained.
 </p>
<p>
  Wael Abu Zuwayed was brought to the Cairo State Security Prosecutor's Office, where it was decided to retain it in pre -trial detention for 15 days. He is accused of having joined a group formed in violation of the law and of having released false information.
 </p>
<p>
  With a controversial move, on March 4, the direction of Ghazl El Mahalla issued notices of dismissal for the workers detained, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed and Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. The company claims that their absence from work lasted ten days, appropriately ignoring that it took place following their detention by national security.
 </p>
<p>
  The Justice Committee (CFJ) has condemned the prisoners, stating that the strike is a "spontaneous" reaction to the economic difficulties of Egypt and the confusion of financial policy. The CFJ underlines the need for a constructive dialogue and realistic solutions to deal with the legitimate requests of workers, instead of resorting to repression and intimidation. [...]

<p>
  In addition to suffering the pressures of the masses for the vile response of the Egyptian regime to the ruthless attacks by the Israeli state in Gaza, the president "strong man" Sisi has to face the growing anger of the workers. The dizzying increase in food prices hardly affected Egyptian low -salary workers, but there are signs of a resumption of struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  About 14,000 textile workers in the largest Egyptian factory, the Misr Spin-think and weiving Company, in Mahalla Al-Kubra, in the region of the Nile delta, started a week of strike on February 22. The workers of one of the major branches of the real estate company Talaat Moustafa Group, Alexan-Dria Construction, in Cairo, protested on February 28th.
 </p>
<p>
  It was the workers of the Mahalla clothing factory that started to mark the slogans that quickly spread from one building to another. The safety personnel blocked the exits to prevent these workers, as well as those of the on -site power plant, gathered in the central square. However, on the third day, 7,000 strikers gathered there. Dozens of people have been arrested. As usual, the official trade union committee managed by the state denounced the strike, but the workers kicked them off the event.
 </p>
<p>
  This event echoes the historic strike of 2006, when Mahalla's women began the strike that was a fundamental step towards the 2011 revolt that ended the 31 years of government of President Hosni Mubarak. In 2008, the city witnessed a revolt that would have repeated himself on a national scale three years later.
 </p>
<p>
  [...] The strike ended after a week, following the intervention of the Minister of the Public Sector. The management agreed to pay a minimum of 6,000 per month and most of the arrested workers were released. A previous offer, which included the payment of extraordinary, participation in profits and health insurance, was not accepted.
 </p>
<p>
  Protest of construction workers
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of workers from Talaat Moustafa protested in front of the company headquarters. The company has fired workers with permanent contracts and replaced them with temporary workers at worst conditions. The workers asked for backward payments, a bonus for the cost of living, a better health insurance and safety devices on construction sites.
 </p>
<p>
  The conditions of the construction sites are bad, there are no security devices and health coverage is insufficient. Many dismissed workers have been injured at work or suffer from chronic diseases.
 </p>
<p>
  The workers reported to journalists that the criteria for bonuses and increases are obscure, but are constantly provided to people related or connected to the managers. The managers and their assistants receive sumptuous benefits, while workers' salaries remain low.
 </p>
<p>
  Unusually, the police did not try to block the protest, even if in the past he stopped smaller protests. However, on March 4, a protest of the offices of the offices was prevented when the security forces blocked the gates.
 </p>
<p>
  But then hundreds of company security guards refused to start their turn! They asked for higher wages, best benefits, working hours and holidays. “Our salaries are very low, equal to 3,000 le. We work for over 14 hours a day, unlike the rest of the employees. We receive the quarterly bonus at a lower percentage than them, "explained a guard.
 </p>
<p>
  Within 30 minutes, a high manager met them, promising to pay an increase within two months, after which the protest ended.
 </p>
<p>
  Mubarak's regime remains
 </p>
<p>
  The Talaat Moustafa group had enormous contracts for the construction of the new capital that President Sisi supervised. Over the past year, he has tripled his activities in the real estate and hospitality sector, despite the economic crisis of Egypt. In recent months, the price of his actions has risen, gaining millions of dollars to his multimilionary main shareholder, Talaat Moustafa. One of the richest men in Africa was close to Hosni's son Mubarak, Gamal, hated by workers for pushing a vast privatization when the father was president.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2008, Talaat Moustafa was recognized guilty of having paid 2 million dollars to a former policeman to kill the Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim. The other main shareholders of the Talaat Moustafa group are the Bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.
 </p>
<p>
  In February, the company concluded a partnership agreement with the investment company of the United Ame Arab Emirates for the construction of a new and vast tourist city in Ras El-Hikma, on the Mediterranean coast, west of Alexandria. The 35 billion dollar operation, including the sale of land by the army, will greatly help the government of Sisi to pay the 42 billion dollars of debts and the interest it will have to pay this year. There are many questions raised, including the feasibility of the project, its environmental cost, the true value of the land, how to have the ownership of the army, what is the opinion of the local residents (who have not been consulted) e What checks will be on future profits in a "free economic area".
 </p>
<p>
  The desperate need for foreign currency of the Sisi government forced him to sell assets owned by the state. Ras El-Hikma adds to the growing list of Egyptian companies and land now under the property and control of the Gulf.
 </p>
<p>
  The serious inequalities, corruption and brutal repression of the opposition of the regime of the former president Hosni Mubarak have continued, and even increased, under Sisi. Recent strikes and workers' protests could mark the beginning of a new wave of actions of the working class, such as the one developed in the last years of Mubarak.

  The awakening of the Egyptian working class could be a powerful factor to end the Gaza crisis, open the Rafah's pass to humanitarian aid and encourage workers and the poor of the whole Middle East and North Africa to dirty their mega-round rulers throughout the region.

<p>
  To end capitalist poverty, war and destruction of the environment, it is necessary to build independent unions and workers' parties with socialist, democratic and internationalist programs.

   NEW YEARS!
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Newroz is the symbol of the
revolt of the exploited and oppressed peoples against the oppressors
and exploiters in the thousands of years of class societies in our
geography. Today, it has become the name of the rebellion and
resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people,
against the persecution of cruelty, the rebellion of the blacksmith
Kawa against the cruel and massacring Dehaks, and the burning of the
fires of rebellion in all four corners.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   We are welcoming Newroz in a
period in which the attacks and massacres of the cruel Dehaks are
increasing worldwide and in our geography. We are in a process where
the conditions for a new imperialist sharing war are maturing and
preparations are being made for it. The increasing rivalry of the
imperialist bourgeoisie is triggering conflicts and occupations at
the regional level. There are not only rivalries and "trade
wars" between the imperialist blocs. The possibility of direct
military confrontation is also increasing. As Russia's war of
occupation of Ukraine evolves into a "protracted war"  war
between the imperialist camps, some spokespersons of the bourgeoisie
make statements that "we must be ready for war".
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The increasing rivalry between
imperialist monopolies is increasing the aggression of reactionary
forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of
the crisis
   <span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<span>
  for their own interests, to expand their areas of
domination and to hold positions. After the Azerbaijani reactionary
occupation of Artsakh-Nagorno-Karabakh, the attacks launched by
Israeli Zionism, citing the October 7 Flood of the Palestinian
national resistance, turned into genocide. The oppressed Palestinian
people were confronted with a new Nakba (catastrophe).
  <span>
</span>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The Turkish state, one of the
most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression
against the Kurdish nation with daily terrorist attacks on the
territory of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria-Rojava
and invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. It is preparing for a
comprehensive invasion attack to liquidate the gains of the Rojava
Revolution and to eliminate the heavy military losses it suffered in
Iraqi Kurdistan. While liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement, the Turkish state is aiming for occupation and then
annexation in the region. It wants to realize its centuries-old
"Misak-ı Milli" goal with the approval of the imperialists
and with its own collaborator reactionary lines in the region.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   For this purpose, after
negotiations with the reactionary forces of the region, a bargain was
struck at the door of US imperialism. The fascist Turkish Republic's
traditional policy of "taking advantage of the contradictions
between the imperialist camps" is once again in effect. Once
again, preparations are being made to attack the oppressed peoples of
our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the isolation
policy is being implemented on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners,
especially Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrest attacks
against revolutionaries continue.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The reason for this aggression
of the Turkish fascism is not independent of the situation it is in.
The century-old regime of oppression and exploitation is in a picture
of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we have
witnessed in the Earthquakes of February 6, while tens of thousands
of people are waiting for help under the debris, they were faced with
a reality of an enemy of the people who did nothing and prevented
those who go to help. The government, which responded to the people's
call for help from the mouth of R.T. Erdogan himself with the curses
"You're immoral, you're despicable, you're dishonorable";
At the current stage, he is once again asking for votes from the
people. The general elections did not solve the crisis of the ruling
classes and even failed to postpone it. At the current stage, they
are once again struggling for rent sharing, this time on the occasion
of local elections.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   While the ruling classes
continue to fight for rent and cliques within themselves, the poverty
of workers and laborers is increasing. Dozens of workers are murdered
every other day in workplace murders. There is an increase in
massacres and hate crimes against women and other gender identities.
Massacres of nature and the environment for the sake of capitalist
rent and plunder continue at full speed. The policy of annihilation,
denial, assimilation and oppression against oppressed nationalities
and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policies
implemented by fascism to maintain its power have created a situation
of social insanity in which torturous massacres of stray animals are
committed.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Turkish state fascism, facing
this picture it has created with its government and opposition, does
what it knows best, fueling racism and chauvinism, under the name of
"social values", it increases its fascist oppression
against "those who are not like itself" and in reality
against all segments that do not obey it. Sunni Islam, the dominant
belief of Turkish fascism, is used as a means of oppressing different
beliefs and to prevent the working and laboring people from rebelling
against the conditions of hunger and poverty they are forced into.
While the policy of "Prayers for Palestine, Ships for Israel"
is continued with determination, fascist aggression against those who
do not bow their heads continues.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Today's cruel Dehaks are at
work. They continue their robbery, extortion and massacres against
the people of the region, especially the people of our country, for
their own wealth and riches. They are preparing new invasions and
attacks for the survival of their regimes built on corruption and
theft. However, there are and will always be blacksmith Kawas against
the cruel Dehaks.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   It is time to be the
blacksmith Kawa against the cruel Dehaks. Now is the time to resist
and struggle. Now is the time to stand up against the oppressors.

<br>
<br>
</br></br></div>
<div>
  The historical experience of the Municipality of Paris has fully experienced that it is of extreme importance for the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat to own revolutionary armed forces.
  <br>
  Speaking of the experience of the Municipality of Paris, Lenin cites an important thesis of Engels, that is, that in France, after each revolution, the workers were armed; The disarmament of the workers was therefore the first commandment for the bourgeois who were in the government of the state. Lenin believes that in this conclusion of Engels, "the essence of the problem, as the essence of the state issue (the oppressed class has weapons?), Is grasped in an admirable way".
  <br/>
  The Municipality of Paris was born during the avid struggle between the armed revolution and the armed counter -revolution. The 72 days of life of the Municipality of Paris were 72 days of armed insurrection, armed struggle and armed self -defense. What caused a panic fear among the bourgeois reactionaries was the
  <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
  fact that the proletariat of Paris had challenged the rifle. The fatal error of the Municipality of Paris resided precisely in the fact that it proved too Clemente towards the counter -revolution and did not immediately march on Versailles, what allowed Thiers to resume breath and to gather his reactionary troops to throw himself furiously on revolutionary Paris. How did Engels said: “Would the municipality of Paris last only one day if she had not served this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? On the contrary, one cannot reproach them that you have not served enough? "
  <br/>
<br/>
  Comrade Mao Tse-Tung has concisely recapitulated the important meaning of the armed struggle and the popular army and formulated the famous thesis according to which "political power stems from the rifle rod"
  <br/>
<br/>
  He underlined: "According to the Marxist theory of the state, the army is the main component of state power. Anyone who wants to take possession of state power and preserve it must have a strong army ".
  <br/>
<br/>
  The violent revolution is a universal principle of the proletarian revolution. The Marxist-Leninist parties must firmly follow this universal principle and apply it to the concrete practice of their countries. Historical experience shows that where the proletariat and oppressed peoples took power and conquered the victory, they did it with the strength of the rifle, under the direction of the proletarian parties, in accordance with the specific conditions of their countries, constituting Gradually popular armed forces and conducting the popular war on the basis of the wide mobilization of the masses in the struggle and hiring repeated struggles against the imperialists and reactionaries. This applies to the Russian revolution, for the Chinese revolution and for the revolution of Albania, Vietnam, Korea and other countries, without any exception.
  <br/>
  On the contrary, when the proletarian parties do not try to create revolutionary armed forces or give up, they cause showers to the revolution; There are serious lessons in this regard. Having renounced challenging the rifle, some parties were taken abruptly in the face of an attack by surprise of imperialism and its lacquers and their counter -revolutionary repression and consequently millions of revolutionaries have been massacred; In other cases, since they wanted to obtain places of high officials in bourgeois governments or fell into the trap stretched by the reactionaries, some parties delivered them the popular armed forces, ruining the fruits of the revolution, when the revolutionary people had already challenged the weapons and the weapons Popular armed forces had already developed considerably.
  <br/>
  In these hundred years, many communist parties participated in the elections and entered Parliament, but none of them was able to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat with this means. Even if a communist party obtains the majority in Parliament or enters the government, this does not mean that the bourgeois character of political power has changed and even less than the old state machine is demolished. The reactionary dominant class can proclaim the elections, dissolve the parliament or even resort to violence to omit the communists. If a proletarian party, instead of carrying out the work between the masses and engage in the armed struggle, supports the elections zealous
  <br/>
  parliamentarians, it will only fall asleep the masses and corrupt himself. The bourgeoisie buys the communist parties through the parliamentary elections and transforms them into revisionist parties, into bourgeois parties. Doesn't history provide us with numerous examples of this kind?
  <br/>
  The proletariat must conquer political power with the rifle and must also defend it with the rifle. A popular army under the direction of a Marxist-Leninist party is the solid pillar of the proletariat's dictatorship and the main factor between the various factors to prevent the restoration of capitalism. With a popular army armed with Marxist-Leninist ideology, you can face any situation, however complex it may be, in the class struggle both inside and outside the country and defend the power of the proletariat ...

   In a process whose value is only 
 politics. The Public Prosecutor of the Hungarian State wants to send a message 
 to all the European and leftist movements of European and left: do not come to 
 demonstrate with us, we are a country where antinazist manifestations 
 They are not welcome, we are not a country that welcomes dissent 
 Against the neo -Nazis then go to another part to manifest, if

 International regulations 15 days of prolonged insulation 
 They constitute to all intents and purposes torture and Ilaria has undergone a 
 isolation for 35 days, but above all he is not serving any

 defense of Ilaria nor the impartiality of a judge who already has 
 issued a sentence of a German co -defendant 
 in the same process of Ilaria.

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

<strong>
</strong>
<br>
  In our long history of people’s democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br br="">
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces, Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India, Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro- imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br br=""/>
  the Adivasi region. People’s resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP’S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this enemy’s machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and women’s organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

  On Thursday, March 21st, an event took place in the international center B5 on the occasion of March 18, the day of the political capture and anniversary of the Paris municipality. The Hamburg Palestine alliance invited to the event.
 </p>
<p>
  It started with a cultural contribution in which activists of the Red Federation sang the song "The Women of the Community". Then they explained the backgrounds of March 18 as the anniversary of the Paris community. The new interview with Professor Saibaba, which was recently released, was announced.
 </p>
<p>
  It was also reported by Young Struggle on the situation of political prisoners in Turkey and Kurdistan, the torture methods in the knots, prison types and explained how the prison system was expanded to accommodate the revolutionary capture.
 </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Representatives of the prisoner information also reported on the background of Daniela Klette's arrest, which is accused of how she is humiliated and reported by the customer's stimulation on Sunday, March 10th in Vechta, where solidarity was shown. The register of the rally, a member of the works council in the hospital in Bremen, has now even been banned from the house in the clinic in which she works. The repression against this person has meanwhile assumed so absurd features that professional bans are again in the room, only for political ideas that you have - i.e. basically a judicial justice.
 </p>
<p>
  In the discussion, once again, in the times when the masses in the world - especially in Palestine - fight and are also on the move in the FRG, important topics are set on the agenda. In this way, the discussion quickly came to important basic questions of revolutionary work and, above all, whether the revolutionaries should continue to wait to show the masses the right way to exemption, about whether they have to show in practice how this struggle is to be carried out. In short: whether missionaries are needed or an actual revolutionary vanguard.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  KP Sharma Oli, Chairman of the CPN-UML, has dismissed speculations regarding his party’s potential entry into the Socialist Front of Nepal. This came following a discussion with Prime Minister and Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre), Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
 </p>
<p>
  Contrary to earlier reports suggesting UML’s integration into the Socialist Front of Nepal, Chairman Oli clarified the party’s stance, refuting any such plans.
 </p>
<p>
  The decision came after a meeting between PM Dahal and Chairman Oli, where the matter was deliberated upon.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the Socialist Front’s earlier decision to extend an invitation to the CPN-UML, Chairman Oli’s statement firmly denies the possibility.
 </p>
<p>
  The Socialist Front of Nepal, formed on June 19, 2023, comprises four parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand.
 </p>
<p>
  With a collective representation of 54 lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the parties affiliated to the newly established Socialist Front of Nepal have made their presence felt in the political arena.

<p>
  In the International Military Tribunal, know as the Nuremberg trial, the Soviet Union together with Yankee, British and French imperialism tried crimes of the European Axis, mainly by the Nazis.
 </p>
<p>
  In the
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/nuremberg-tribunal-charter-1945">
   Charter of the International Military Tribunal
  </a>
  , war crimes is defined as follows:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ War crimes: ‘ namely, violations of the laws or customs of war. Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity;”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  In addition the Soviet Union proposed to include crimes against civilians, which were defined in the Charter as crimes against humanity:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ Crimes against humanity: ‘ namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The charter also established that not only the individual directly committing an act is responsible for the crime:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Regarding war crimes we have already
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/19/gaza-famine-is-imminent/">
   reported
  </a>
  on some of the violation of laws of war committed by the State of Israel. With neglecting to provide necessary supplies to the population under its occupation and further blocking other parties from delivering these supplies, in addition to destroying necessary infrastructure such as water wells and poisoning the groundwater with seawater, the State of Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. These acts violates

In addition more than 8,000 people are missing, likely dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings. With this the real death toll is likely closer to 2% of the Palestinians in Gaza. The imminent famine and continuing military attacks against civilians point toward even larger parts of the population being murdered. The State of Israel has also forcefully displaced almost

  , more than half of the homes of Gaza, have been destroyed or damaged. Only 12 out of 35 hospitals are partially functioning. 392 educational facilities have been destroyed or damaged. 83% of groundwater wells are not operational. 267 places of worship have been destroyed or damaged. According to
  <a href="https://undark.org/2024/03/13/satellites-show-damaged-buildings-gaza/">
   satellite images
  </a>
  an estimated 157,200 buildings have been damaged or destroyed. In densely populated areas more than half of all buildings have been destroyed. In northern Gaza almost three-fourths of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. There is no doubt that the State of Israel is committing “
  <em>
   wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity”.

  The mentioned war crimes are also crimes against humanity: “
  <em>
   murder, … deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population
  </em>
  ”. The
  <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf">
   Rome Statute
  </a>
  of the International Criminal Court expands on “
  <em>
   extermination
  </em>
  ” as a crime against humanity:
  <em>
   “’Extermination’ includes the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The State of Israel is not only committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, they are carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. The
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/genocide-conv-1948">
   Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
  </a>
  from 1948, defines genocide as “
  <em>
   any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (a) Killing members of the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

</p>
<p>
<em>
   (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  We have already explained how the State of Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily harm, and inflicting upon them conditions of life such as starvation. Since last October Israeli officials have at many times publicly revealed their genocidal intention and have made direct and public incitement to genocide. Many examples of these are included in South Africa’s

  </a>
  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for charging the State of Israel for genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made many statements dehumanizing the Palestinian people and called for exterminating them. On the 15

  <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke-start151023">

   formal address
  </a>
  to the Israeli Knesset, he described the situation as “a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle”. In his “

  On the 12

  <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2023-10-13/israeli-president-says-gazans-could-have-risen-up-to-fight-hamas">
   stated
  </a>
  the following in a press conference: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.” He has also made
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/173933430267074594">
   handwritten messages
  </a>
  on bombs dropped in Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’
  <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel">
   stated
  </a>
  that Israel was “imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” He has further made the genocidal plan clear by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjHcnNB0E8">
   stating
  </a>
  the following: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”
 </p>
<p>
  On the 10

  of November the Israeli Minister for National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, clarified the government’s position,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1723784790682358189">
   stating
  </a>
  : “[t]o be clear, when we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy — they’re all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.”
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Heritage, Amachai Eliyahu,
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyau.a/videos/148918588283326/">
   stated
  </a>
  the following on the 1
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  of November: “The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes … We must talk about the day after. In my mind, we will hand over lots to all those who fought for Gaza over the years and to those evicted from Gush Katif” [a former Israeli settlement].
 </p>
<p>
  Israeli Army Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (‘Cagat’), Major General Ghassan Alian, Statted the following in an official
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5a0EWv-o7mE">
   video statement
  </a>
  addressed to Hamas and Gaza residents: “Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”
 </p>
<p>
  Giora Eiland, Israeli Army Reservist Major General, former Head of the Israeli National Security Council, and adviser to the Defense Minister, has, among many genocidal statements, incited genocide by targeting the water supply,
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5Ow2T0Na20BcoL2yautiobij8ldNsVK/view">
   noting
  </a>
  that water in Gaza “comes from wells with salt water unfit for consumption. They have water treatment plants, Israel should hit those plants.” He has also
  <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sju3uabba">
   stated
  </a>
  that “Israel needs to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, compelling tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Egypt or the Gulf … Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist”. If the genocidal intentions of the State of Israel was not already clear, Eiland makes sure to clarify this by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/TalulaSha/status/1726267178201362438">
   stating
  </a>
  that: “When senior Israeli figures say in the media ‘It’s either us or them’ we should clarify the question of who is ‘them’. ‘They’ are not only Hamas fighters with weapons, but also all the ‘civilian’ officials, including hospital administrators and school administrators, and also the entire Gaza population who enthusiastically supported Hamas and cheered on its atrocities on October 7th.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the facts of the ongoing genocide being clear, the signatures of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, including the imperialists, are obliged to prevent and punish it.
 </p>
<p>
  However, not only are the imperialists negating this obligation, some of the imperialists are also complicit in the genocide. We already

  to suppress the popular support for the Palestinian people. The British Home Secretary has sent a

  </a>
  to police chiefs in England and Wales, stating that waving the Palestinian flag, and shouting slogans such as ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’, may be a criminal offense.” Accordingly German imperialism faces accusations of being complicit in the genocide at the ICJ.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialists have only widened their support for the genocide since this. Yankee President, Joe Biden, is currently working on giving a further

  While we here have focused on crimes committed in the current campaign against Gaza, the peoples of the world will not forget the other crimes committed by the State of Israel since it was established, and the crimes it is currently committing in the West Bank, such as the increasing amount of illegal settlements, as well as the crime of apartheid within the annexed territory.

The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information.

In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6.

The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/><br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/><br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2.

Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/><br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/><br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/><br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/><br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/><br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means. In particular, such measures shall  be implemented in the case of a victim of sexual violence or a child who is a victim or a witness, unless  otherwise ordered by the Court, having regard to all the circumstances, particularly the views of the victim  or witness.  3. Where the personal interests of the victims are affected, the Court shall permit their views and concerns to  be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court and in  a manner which is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial  trial. Such views and concerns may be presented by the legal representatives of the victims where the Court  considers it appropriate, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. The Victims and Witnesses Unit may advise the Prosecutor and the Court on appropriate protective  measures, security arrangements, counselling and assistance as referred to in article 43, paragraph 6. <br/><br/>34 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court5. Where the disclosure of evidence or information pursuant to this Statute may lead to the grave endangerment  of the security of a witness or his or her family, the Prosecutor may, for the purposes of any proceedings  conducted prior to the commencement of the trial, withhold such evidence or information and instead  submit a summary thereof. Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or  inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial.  6. A State may make an application for necessary measures to be taken in respect of the protection of its  servants or agents and the protection of confidential or sensitive information.

Before testifying, each witness shall, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, give an  undertaking as to the truthfulness of the evidence to be given by that witness.  2. The testimony of a witness at trial shall be given in person, except to the extent provided by the measures  set forth in article 68 or in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The Court may also permit the giving of  viva voce (oral) or recorded testimony of a witness by means of video or audio technology, as well as the  introduction of documents or written transcripts, subject to this Statute and in accordance with the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the  accused.  3. The parties may submit evidence relevant to the case, in accordance with article 64. The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4. The Court may rule on the relevance or admissibility of any evidence, taking into account, inter alia , the  probative value of the evidence and any prejudice that such evidence may cause to a fair trial or to a fair  evaluation of the testimony of a witness, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  5. The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial notice of them.  7. Evidence obtained by means of a violation of this Statute or internationally recognized human rights shall  not be admissible if:  (a) The violation casts substantial doubt on the reliability of the evidence; or  (b) The admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of  the proceedings. 8. When deciding on the relevance or admissibility of evidence collected by a State, the Court shall not rule  on the application of the State's national law.  Article 70   Offences against the administration of justice 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over the following offences against its administration of justice when  committed intentionally:  (a) Giving false testimony when under an obligation pursuant to article 69, paragraph 1, to tell the truth;  (b) Presenting evidence that the party knows is false or forged;  (c) Corruptly influencing a witness, obstructing or interfering with the attendance or testimony of a  witness, retaliating against a witness for giving testimony or destroying, tampering with or interfering  with the collection of evidence;  (d) Impeding, intimidating or corruptly influencing an official of the Court for the purpose of forcing or  persuading the official not to perform, or to perform improperly, his or her duties;  (e) Retaliating against an official of the Court on account of duties performed by that or another official;  (f) Soliciting or accepting a bribe as an official of the Court in connection with his or her official duties. 2.

The conditions for providing  international cooperation to the Court with respect to its proceedings under this article shall be governed  by the domestic laws of the requested State. <br/><br/>35 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3. In the event of conviction, the Court may impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years, or a fine  in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, or both.  4. (a) Each State Party shall extend its criminal laws penalizing offences against the integrity of its own     investigative or judicial process to offences against the administration of justice referred to in this     article, committed on its territory, or by one of its nationals;  (b) Upon request by the Court, whenever it deems it proper, the State Party shall submit the case to its  competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall treat such cases with  diligence and devote sufficient resources to enable them to be conducted effectively. Article 71   Sanctions for misconduct before the Court 1. The Court may sanction persons present before it who commit misconduct, including disruption of its  proceedings or deliberate refusal to comply with its directions, by administrative measures other than  imprisonment, such as temporary or permanent removal from the courtroom, a fine or other similar  measures provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  2. The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/><br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/><br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/><br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/><br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/><br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6.

Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/><br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/><br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/><br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/><br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  Thousands of Greenlandic women were involuntarily implanted with IUDs to prevent them from becoming pregnant in the 1960s-1970s by the Danish colonial authorities. This was done to reduce population growth in Greenland – a cruel and cynical expression of population control as part of Danish imperialism’s colonial policy in Greenland.

  During the 1950s to 1960s, the birth rate in Greenland increased by 80%, with 1.781 children born per year in 1966. In 1966, the decision was made by the Ministry of Greenland and the Danish National Board of Health to implant IUDs in 4,500 of Greenland’s 9.000 estimated fertile women, that is 50%. Greenland’s population at the time was around 40.500. The so-called “IUD campaign” reached its peak intensity in the period between 1966 and the 1970s, when the procedures were performed without the consent of young women, some as young as 12 years old. Danish imperialism succeeded in slowing population growth through its cynical abuses, but in 1974 it was forced to abandon the policy. Not because it regretted its failures, but because its policy had succeeded and it feared a backlash in the form of rebellion and criticism of its policy from the UN – several of whose conventions had been violated throughout the process.

  The forced state contraception was carried out during a period when Greenland had formally ceased to be a Danish colony – but still is in practice today. At this time, however, Greenland was still subject to the Ministry of Greenland in the government, which oversaw the introduction of the coercive measures in the so-called IUD Campaign. The abuses were allegedly done so that population growth would not prevent the modernization of Greenland, in other words: not to get in the way of Danish imperialism’s desire to continue its dominance over Greenland. Many people in Greenland do not speak Danish, yet only Danish was spoken in the operating rooms and the doctors were Danes. Many of the girls were not informed that they were being sterilized, both because of the language barrier, but also because it was kept secret from them and their families.

<p>
  Greenland’s population growth has never recovered since the IUD Campaign and the population of Greenland has stagnated since the 1990s.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the policy was officially abandoned in 1974, it was unofficially continued for many years. In 1992, the local authorities in Greenland took over the health sector, where the policy continued with a further 14 Greenlandic women having IUDs implanted without consent.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  The abuse has caused permanent damage to many women today, who experience many discomforts such as pelvic inflammatory disease, severe pain, irregular bleeding and permanent tissue damage and sterilization. The IUDs used at the time were of the Lippes Loop type and were much larger than those used today, and were only intended for women who had already given birth before. For this reason, among others, the IUD has led to permanent trauma in many women’s abdomens after being in place for decades.
 </p>
<p>
  Involuntary contraception is not just a thing of the distant past either. In an interview with 4 Greenlandic women, the British media BBC has revealed how at least 4 cases of involuntary birth control have been known to have been carried out by the authorities in Greenland since the turn of the millennium. Information has also
  <a href="">
   reported
  </a>
  on at least three involuntary induced abortions performed by the authorities in 2004, 2010 and 2013.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, 143 Greenlandic women are suing the Danish state, seeking compensation of 300.000 DKK [Note by translator: around 44.000 USD] each for their suffering. This case is currently receiving a lot of media attention. The bourgeois Danish state and the authorities in Greenland are currently using the case as part of a “historical investigation of the Danish-Greenlandic history”, 45 million DKK [Note by translator: around 6,5 million USD] has been allocated by the state for this purpose. This investigation is part of the ongoing process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands to go from colonies to semi-colonies. Danish imperialism therefore needs to admit many of its crimes and come clean about them in order to continue its exploitation of Greenland and its strategic position in the Arctic.
 </p>
<p>
  The transition from colony to semi-colony for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should be understood as a deliberate act of Danish imperialism. It is a way for it to refine its exploitation of the countries, as this is more stable than the official colonial form. At the same time, it is an expression of the fact that revolution is the main trend in the world today, it is a sign of the decay of imperialism and the collapse of the last remnants of the colonial system in the world. Danish imperialism has learned the lessons of the people’s anti-colonial struggles in mainly Africa and Asia and has chosen to stay ahead of them by dictating the process itself. The inter-imperialist contradictions must also be taken into account, with mainly Yankee imperialism taking a renewed interest in the Arctic in its struggle against Russian imperialism. At the same time, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has now attracted the attention of other imperialists who want to develop mining in Greenland.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
<img alt="" class="wp-image-10198" decoding="async" height="759" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SpiralCampaign_5.webp" srcset="https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SpiralCampaign_5.webp" width="900"/>
</figure>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should therefore be understood as a sign of weakness for Danish imperialism and imperialism in general, which is no longer able to maintain colonies, and that the masses in Greenland and the Faroe Islands defiantly continue to combat and resist.

  network of spy satellites called ”Starshield” under a classified contract with the US government. SpaceX has a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which includes personnel from the CIA and the Space Forces, to build a network of satellites able to quickly single out military targets almost anywhere in the world to support the ground forces of US imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  “The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,” a spokesperson for the NRO described the system. According to sources close to the project, the system would be so extensive that ”no one could hide”. The spy system would consist of low-orbiting satellites able to provide the US military with detailed images of the Earth, and it would also be

   more immun
  </a>
  e to disruptions, which the US says especially Russian imperialism would attempt to cause to its satellites. This system would provide information faster and near-constantly compared to old-type of higher-orbiting satellites.
 </p>
<p>
  Chinese social-imperialism has its own aspirations regarding the militarization of space, and its own spy satellite network program, and it immediately
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/world/china-s-military-state-media-slam-u-s-after-reuters-report-on-spacex-spy-satellites/ar-BB1k54mu">
   expressed
  </a>
  its concern over ”Starshield” and accused the US of escalating tensions and threatening “global security”. Russian imperialism
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/russia-warns-united-states-use-of-spacex-for-spying-makes-its-satellites-a-target/ar-BB1kdw8l">
   warned
  </a>
  the US that through using commercial satellites for military purposes, these satellites become legitimate military targets.
 </p>
<p>
  In one hand, as is highlighted in the mainstream media, Starshield reflects the US asserting its position as the sole hegemonic superpower over Russian imperialism, as well as Chinese social-imperialism, with a massive militarization of space, using the most advanced new technologies. In the other hand, and mainly, corresponding to the main contradiction in the world today, it is spearheaded against the oppressed nations, in order to increase repression against their struggle for liberation, “so that no one can hide” from the all-seeing eye of Yankee imperialism. Here it is necessary to note however that even though imperialists highlight how advanced, how “omnipotent” this technology is, faced with the peoples of the world it is only a paper tiger.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2021, the US Department of Defense (DoD) officials
  <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2629675/space-based-capabilities-critical-to-us-national-security-dod-officials-say/">
   said
  </a>
  that space-based capabilities are critical for the US and that the US has to be prepared to conflicts which extent to space or even originate there, not meaning that war would be waged in space but that space would play a role in armed conflicts on Earth. In this context, DoD described as the main threat the space aspirations of Russian imperialism and Chinese social-imperialism: “Russia and China view space as critical to modern warfare and consider the use of counterspace capabilities as both a means of reducing U.S. military effectiveness and winning future wars”, DoD principal director for space policy said.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX is the largest operator of satellites in the world. The first SpaceX satellite was developed under a contract with the US, and its Falcon 9 rockets have been used to transport US military payloads to space. Already before Starshield SpaceX had aspirations to sell its Starlink technology to the US Department of Defense, but what the US imperialism wanted was technology specifically engineered to meet its needs.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX has already around 5,500 commercial Starlink satellites orbiting the Earth. These provide internet for different actors, and it is used among others by the Ukrainian military for communications. SpaceX sent 22,000 Starlink terminals to Ukraine in the first year since the beginning of the war of aggression, and they have played a “significant role”
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/10/europe/ukraine-starlink-not-active-crimea-intl-hnk/index.html">
   according
   said
  </a>
  it has evidence Starlink has been used also by Russia. The war of aggression in Ukraine has therefore in one hand served to refine the technology for military purposes, and in the other it has shown the capabilities of such technology and the “necessity” of the increasing militarization of space for the imperialists. Therefore it has raised the interest of US imperialism to ensure such technology serves its interests only and can be used extensively for this – and to this the Starshield system answers.
 </p>
<p>
  It is
  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/airpower-after-ukraine/commercial-satellites-are-on-the-front-lines-of-war-today-heres-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-warfare/">
   claimed
  </a>
  that as the costs of launching satellites and rockets to space lower and more and more commercial companies pop up, it “democratizes” the space. This is of course a similar machination as the free competition and “the American dream” under capitalism, that today has reached the stage of imperialism, and the tendency of monopolization and struggle for hegemony is seen also in space and this commercialization of space is used by the imperialists to achieve their interests. It is openly stated by US experts that using commercial technologies for military purposes is the future, and companies are put to develop military technologies in close contact with the US government. Trae Stephens, a principal at Founders Fund, whose investments include SpaceX, said in 2023 that the war of aggression has woken up members of the financial oligarchy to see the potential in military technologies instead of civilian infrastructure. This means deeper militarization of society.

  As the general crisis of imperialism develops further and further, it becomes more and more urgent for the imperialists to develop all-encompassing militarization, that even reaches space. Technological advancement is put to serve destruction and the maintaining of oppression, the hegemony of the US imperialism in the world. This is a sign of weakness, and as has been seen multiple times, despite its technological overpower, it has experienced and keeps on experiencing devastating blows from the peoples of the world.

  Approximately 100 farmers organized by the Poor Peasant Association Jaqueira (Pernambuco) from various communities took back their water source, which had been fenced by a large farmer company.

<p>
  March 18, about 100 LCP farmer conquerors in Jaqueira, Pernambuco (PE) communities (Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabugi, Monteir, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa d'Andua, Tenório and Sítio Grande) combined their power He surrounded the large farming company Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A, owned by the farm of the farm Guilherme Maranhão.
 </p>
<p>
  Since 2015, when the robbery of countries and water sources began, the peasants have lived and produced the former Frei Caneca farm. Former Government Maranhãp, supported by former governor Paulo Camara, set up gun groups that threaten the entire population to expand cattle breeding to international export through the slaughterhouse.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite comprehensive evidence of water poisoning by the pest of the water (in addition to the pollution of cattle and the pollution), the Pernambuco Public Ministry (MPPE) and the Pernambuco Environmental Secretariat (CPRH) never began any criminal investigation by Agroopocuárin Mata S/A.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, at the People's Assembly, the peasants decided to implement a large act to take the water sources back from the large farm. The invitation reached the entire local population in flying markets and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts to clean and isolated water sources, 50 meters from the livestock farmer and eucalyptus plantations.

  To do all this work, the status advocates dropped José Ricardo's revolutionary area of peasants and young students in the Mangue Vermelho movement. They helped to clear the bushes and mark fences to protect water sources in the scorching sun. More, they met alongside the rest of the people, fighting the provocations of the gentlemen.

  As soon as the peasants had completed their joint effort with the first water source of the day, singing folk songs and shouting slogans, half -time rifle from large farms appeared with tractors, stage farms, motorcycles and quads. The gunmen arrived with the posts, thread and eucalyptus seeds to put them in the same area that the peasants had just cleared. When the peasant march faced bands, representatives of the farmland began to threaten the peasants with firearms. The voltage led to a confrontation, three guns were injured, and the droon of the big farm was destroyed by the furious folk of firearms.
 </p>
<p>
  This same March 18: A MPPE agricultural promoter, CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee to monitor agrarian conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the pasture commission (CPT) and Pernambuco workers and peasant federation (Fetape) perhaps A large farming company Agropecuária from Mata Sul S/A visited to study complaints of the peasants made by the farm. According to this information, this Commission did not visit the water sources of the peasants, but only to the places shown in the farm.
 </p>
<p>
  However, the powerful action of the peasants forced the entire Commission to introduce the act at the scene of the Aktio and to approve two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Folk Alliance (Abrapo) and the Commission of the Barro Branco Farm Association, and also had to accept the urgent conditions of the people in the public.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, the MPPE accepted the proposal of the peasants represented by Abrapo to create a "water corridor" to separate the people's water sources. The landlord was ordered to pay for the posts and wire, the city administration sent the workers, and the State Environment Department became responsible for examining the people's waters to determine pollution and open a criminal investigation against the landlord.
 </p>
<p>
  After hearing the court, Guilherme Maranhão's gunmen asked for reinforcements from the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to plant eucalyptus to one of the water sources, which had been cleaned up by the peasants, and the farm lawyer Eduardo Figueredo proclaimed that they would complete the milestone.
 </p>
<p>
  Two vehicles were sent to bring security to the gunmen to continue their anti -folk action. This is not a courage to show, but rather a cowardice in front of a small display of peasants connected and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how dedicated the military forces of this old state are about protecting the interests of the state of space and promoting the poverty of the poor in the country and in the city.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasants occupying the former Frei Caneca status are determined to take back all their water sources and their land from the hands of the farm. In this way, they invite all peasants in the southern forest area of the Pernambuco to rise against the rifle groups of large farms and the armed forces of this old state. Without destruction, large farms can never be entitled to the poor of the rural rural.

  On March 19, the São Benedito Peasant Community, in the municipality of São Bernardo, Maranhão, denounced in its social network criminal activities of land grabbers that threaten the life of the local population. In the video, a ten -year -old reports attempts at invasion and dirt theft, but that the peasants “won't leave”. It also shows the intense peasant production on site.
 </p>
<p>
  The community has over 200 years of existence, with lands passed from generation to generation, in which residents work in the fields for their subsistence. According to what was documented by them,

  Similar situations have grown throughout the state of Maranhão, especially after the implementation of the "Land Grabbing Law", sanctioned by Governor Carlos Brandão. Being an updated version of the well-known Sarney Land Law, the legislation that expands the possibility of regularization of public lands from 200 to 2.5 thousand hectares, serving as an instrument for landowners, in the name of agribusiness, to feel entitled to commit heinous acts of violence against peasant, indigenous and quilombola people.

   As we have already denounced (*), the Egyptian regime of Al Sisi is making a fence in the Sinai desert to lock the Palestinians on the run from Gaza, and thus facilitate the "ethnic cleaning" by Israel, in exchange for funding of the Ill.
  </p>
<p>
   The Egyptian regime is dominated by the military, who are also among the major capitalists of the country. "Pharaonic" affected business, such as the construction of the new capital (with enormous profits for themselves and for friends), have also magnified the debt of the state and now the only payment of interest on the debt weighs for over 10% of the GDP. Solution: print money, then create inflation, that is, cut the purchasing power of wages to maintain the profits of the owners, private, state and military.
   <br>
   In September 2023 the inflation had reached 40%, that is, the purchasing power of the already miserable wages and salaries had undergone a 40%cut.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Fearing the discontent for hunger wages also among public employees, the government has decreed the increase in the minimum wage from 4,000 to 6,000 Egyptian pounds (at the current gearbox, today 120 euros per month). For private employees, however, the minimum wage was brought to only 3,500.
   <br>
   In January, to workers who protested for the low wages, at Sisi he had the shamelessness of responding: “We don't eat? Let's eat. We don't drink? We drink, and everything works [and here he had made an obscene, sprinkling, comparison with the condition of the Palestinians deliberately hungry and thirsty by the Zionist state - ed.]. Are things expensive and some are not available? So?".
  </br></p>

</a>
<b>
   Mahalla al-Kubra in the Nile delta, who has more than a century of history and struggles, arrived on February 22nd.
  </b>
<b>
   Discaning the protest slogans went on strike in 3,700.
  </b>
  Despite the intervention of the guards to prevent them from accessing the Central Piazzale, and the descenda in the field of the official union against the strike, the strike, supported by an independent union, has extended to at least 7 thousand workers.
  <br/>
  The response of the masters and the government was: stick and carrot. Minimum salary at 6,000 le (a 70%increase), arrest of 13 "leader" of the strike (source: Labourstart), of which two still held on March 13, are also threatened with dismissal due to unjustified absence.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   Evidently masters and government count on the continuation of inflation (still at 31% in January 2024), which will remain the increases, and the arrests are a warning to anyone, in Mahalla or elsewhere, came to mind to return to the struggle.
   <br/>
   But letting the strike continues without concessions seemed too dangerous to the government: he would have risked a generalized explosion because he knows that the strong increase in the cost of living has increased the pressure between the workers.
   <br/>
   An explosion that could connect to popular support to the Palestinian cause that is in Egypt, although the military regime does everything that may not to show it, and to the more general discontent for the heavy working and life conditions of millions of proletarians.
  </p>
<p>
   On the same days, in fact, hundreds of workers of a large construction company owned by the billionaire Talaat Moustafa, in companies with the Saudi family of the Bin Laden, fell into struggle.
  </p>
  They protested against the dismissal of permanent workers (especially those who have undergone accidents at work or have fallen sick) to hire workers with precarious contracts, and asking for the payment of arrears, a wage increase for caravan, safety measures and devices protection on construction sites, greater health coverage.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   In this case it is significant that the company guards, who a week earlier had intervened to repress a protest of the employees, a few days later they refused to enter service, complaining about being paid the 3000 (60 euros) per month For 14 hours of work a day, and have obtained an increase.
  </p>
<p>
   The Talaat Moustafa group, which has become a giant with orders for the new capital, is now participating in companies with the ADQ of the Emirates group in a 35 billion dollar project for the construction of a tourist city on the Mediterranean coast, on land privatized by military.
  </p>
<p>
   These episodes of workers are indicative of a social temperature that is going up to Egypt as in other countries of the Middle East and which could lead to new explosions if the economic crisis will worsen, in connection also with the anger caused by the genocidal war of Israel against The population of Gaza.
   <br/>
   It is no coincidence that the IMF offers Al-Sisi billions in exchange for work dirty with collaboration with Israel; While on their part Meloni and Von del Leyen promise 7.4 billion euros to Egypt because he does the equally dirty work of retaining emigrants to Europe, as well as for other lucrative business.
  </p>
<p>
   We allow ourselves to repeat it: the only true friends of the Palestinians attacked and oppressed by Israel to Gaza and in West Bank are the workers and the exploited of the region and the world, not the Arab capitalist governments who exploit and repress their workers and are ready to do Business by collaborating with the imperialist metropolis in the repression of Palestinians and migrants.

    Thousands of workers strike for the increase in wages in the Ghazl al-Mahalla factory
   </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
   - Di Beesan Kassab, 25 Febbraio 2024
  </p>
<p>
   Ghazl Al-Mahalla's workers are on strike to obtain higher wages and more equipped bonuses.
  </p>
<p>
   About 7,000 workers met on Saturday morning in the central square of the Ghazl al-Mahalla industrial complex for a strike that has already lasted for three days.
  </p>
<p>
   They ask that their daily meal is increased to 30 the [= 0.57 euros], raising a choir in which the amount is said to barely cover "the price of a liter of milk".
  </p>
<p>
   They also ask for the application of higher wages, referring to a recent wage increase for the public sector based on instructions by President Abdel Fattoh Al-Sisi, in the midst of an inflationary wave that has raised the cost of living at national level . In other slogans, workers asked: "Where is Sisi's decision?".
  </p>
<p>
   The mega-phabbrica of public property uses tens of thousands of people in the sectors of spinning, textile and medical cotton, as well as a power plant on a huge area of land in Mahalla al-Kubra, in the Governorate of Gharbiya.
  </p>
<p>
   Until Sunday, the negotiations of workers with the parent company have failed, said the center for unions and services to workers in a release released on Saturday evening. The meeting was attended by a representative of the Presidency, of the Labor Office, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the President of the General Union of Filaure and Weaving.
  </p>
<p>
   Several men who work in the company were held on Saturday by the National Security Agency after being summoned to be interrogated by the safety body together with some workers, said Ctws, without specifying the number of prisoners.
  </p>
<p>
   The workers launched the strike on Thursday [February 22], they told Mada Masr, starting in the prevalence of female clothing factories, which historically were at the forefront of several famous strikes of the company.
  </p>
<p>
   Hanan*, supervisor of a clothing factory, told Mada Masr that the workers of his building began to mark slogans, finally interrupting the work while the songs spread from one factory to another.
  </p>
<p>
   At the same time, the security staff sealed the exits to prevent women from pouring into the central square of the complex, known as Piazza Talaat Harb. This safety measure was also applied to the power plant, according to Abdullah* who works there.
  </p>
<p>
   The security staff unlocked the gates of the factory around 15.00 on Thursday, half an hour before the end of the morning round, to make sure the workers left the premises and did not meet inside, said Hanan.
  </p>
<p>
   The company's workers described the low wages as a cause of dissatisfaction.
  </p>
<p>
   The cost of living has increased throughout the country, with an inflation that will exceed 30% in 2024. A recent "presidential package", which will be launched starting from March, provides for an increase in the minimum wage for the 4,000 public sector At 6,000 per month, with increases ranging from 1,000 to 1,200 per various job categories.
  </p>
<p>
   Although it is owned by the state, the Misr Spinning and Weiving Company, which owns Ghazl al-Mahalla, does not fall within the context of the presidential package, told Mada Masr a source of the Ministry of Finance.
  </p>
<p>
   The wages of the company are instead guided by the decisions of the National Council for Salari, which last October raised the minimum wage of the private sector to 3,500 le.
  </p>
<p>
   But the increase in October did not serve to contrast the reduction of purchasing power caused by inflation. After more than 25 years of service, Abdel Aziz* told Mada Masr that his total gain does not exceed 4,000 a month. The figure is equivalent to about $ 130 at the official exchange rate, or about 80 dollars at the rate of the market parallel to the time we write.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdullah said that his salary is 4,200 Lee after 33 years of work with the company. Hanan, who is approaching the pension, receives a salary of about 6,200 he.
  </p>
<p>
   Several sources of work of the company said that days before the strike, Gharbiya governor had made a series of visits to inspect a convoy that provides subsidized assets to the company's workers.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdel Aziz added that during Wednesday's visit, the Governor inspected a medical convoy that supplies the workers and "a worker told the Governor that his salary does not exceed 3500 le".
  </p>
<p>
   According to a declaration of the Ctws published on Saturday, the workers now ask that the minimum salary is brought to 6,000 le, with wage increases based on the seniority of service and a reduction of tax appropriations.
  </p>
<p>
   They also ask that their daily allowance for meals increased to 30 le, for a total of 900 per month instead of the current 210 per month, with a song circulating during the strike in which it was stated that the amount covers a barely "the price of a liter of milk".
  </p>
<p>
   The Ctws declaration of Saturday [February 24] stressed that the members of the company's official trade union committee, affiliated to the Egyptian union federation aligned to the state, tried to dissuade workers from the strike and to intimidate them, but were expelled from the square .
  </p>
<p>
   A prominent figure of the company's official trade union committee declared on Thursday in Mada Masr, on condition of anonymity, that the committee "prefers negotiation to the strike, but supports workers' requests".
  </p>
<p>
   Ghazl Al-Mahalla acted as a catalyst in late 2006 for a rebirth of the union action at national level, when a strike of tens of thousands of workers in the factory reverberated in a movement of similar strikes in other factories in the country.

   Press release of the Committee for Justice
   <br/>
   Geneva - March 6, 2024
  </p>
<p>
   In a worrying development, the national security of Gharbia, in Egypt, would have retained at least five employees of the renowned textile company Ghazl El-Mahalla, despite the workers' decision to disperse their strike on February 29, 2024.
   <br/>
   The employees started the strike to request the application of the minimum wage.
  </p>
<p>
   Among the prisoners are Wael Abu Zuwayed and Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, currently held at the national security office for so much. They are added to three other workers, Sabah Ali Al-Qattan, Muhammad Al-Attar and Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, also detained.
  </p>
<p>
   Wael Abu Zuwayed was brought to the Cairo State Security Prosecutor's Office, where it was decided to retain it in pre -trial detention for 15 days. He is accused of having joined a group formed in violation of the law and of having released false information.
  </p>
<p>
   With a controversial move, on March 4, the direction of Ghazl El Mahalla issued notices of dismissal for the workers detained, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed and Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. The company claims that their absence from work lasted ten days, appropriately ignoring that it took place following their detention by national security.
  </p>
<p>
   The Justice Committee (CFJ) has condemned the prisoners, stating that the strike is a "spontaneous" reaction to the economic difficulties of Egypt and the confusion of financial policy. The CFJ underlines the need for a constructive dialogue and realistic solutions to deal with the legitimate requests of workers, instead of resorting to repression and intimidation. [...]

<p>
   In addition to suffering the pressures of the masses for the vile response of the Egyptian regime to the ruthless attacks by the Israeli state in Gaza, the president "strong man" Sisi has to face the growing anger of the workers. The dizzying increase in food prices hardly affected Egyptian low -salary workers, but there are signs of a resumption of struggle.
  </p>
<p>
   About 14,000 textile workers in the largest Egyptian factory, the Misr Spin-think and weiving Company, in Mahalla Al-Kubra, in the region of the Nile delta, started a week of strike on February 22. The workers of one of the major branches of the real estate company Talaat Moustafa Group, Alexan-Dria Construction, in Cairo, protested on February 28th.
  </p>
<p>
   It was the workers of the Mahalla clothing factory that started to mark the slogans that quickly spread from one building to another. The safety personnel blocked the exits to prevent these workers, as well as those of the on -site power plant, gathered in the central square. However, on the third day, 7,000 strikers gathered there. Dozens of people have been arrested. As usual, the official trade union committee managed by the state denounced the strike, but the workers kicked them off the event.
  </p>
<p>
   This event echoes the historic strike of 2006, when Mahalla's women began the strike that was a fundamental step towards the 2011 revolt that ended the 31 years of government of President Hosni Mubarak. In 2008, the city witnessed a revolt that would have repeated himself on a national scale three years later.
  </p>
<p>
   [...] The strike ended after a week, following the intervention of the Minister of the Public Sector. The management agreed to pay a minimum of 6,000 per month and most of the arrested workers were released. A previous offer, which included the payment of extraordinary, participation in profits and health insurance, was not accepted.
  </p>
<p>
   Protest of construction workers
  </p>
<p>
   Hundreds of workers from Talaat Moustafa protested in front of the company headquarters. The company has fired workers with permanent contracts and replaced them with temporary workers at worst conditions. The workers asked for backward payments, a bonus for the cost of living, a better health insurance and safety devices on construction sites.
  </p>
<p>
   The conditions of the construction sites are bad, there are no security devices and health coverage is insufficient. Many dismissed workers have been injured at work or suffer from chronic diseases.
  </p>
<p>
   The workers reported to journalists that the criteria for bonuses and increases are obscure, but are constantly provided to people related or connected to the managers. The managers and their assistants receive sumptuous benefits, while workers' salaries remain low.
  </p>
<p>
   Unusually, the police did not try to block the protest, even if in the past he stopped smaller protests. However, on March 4, a protest of the offices of the offices was prevented when the security forces blocked the gates.
  </p>
<p>
   But then hundreds of company security guards refused to start their turn! They asked for higher wages, best benefits, working hours and holidays. “Our salaries are very low, equal to 3,000 le. We work for over 14 hours a day, unlike the rest of the employees. We receive the quarterly bonus at a lower percentage than them, "explained a guard.
  </p>
<p>
   Within 30 minutes, a high manager met them, promising to pay an increase within two months, after which the protest ended.
  </p>
<p>
   Mubarak's regime remains
  </p>
<p>
   The Talaat Moustafa group had enormous contracts for the construction of the new capital that President Sisi supervised. Over the past year, he has tripled his activities in the real estate and hospitality sector, despite the economic crisis of Egypt. In recent months, the price of his actions has risen, gaining millions of dollars to his multimilionary main shareholder, Talaat Moustafa. One of the richest men in Africa was close to Hosni's son Mubarak, Gamal, hated by workers for pushing a vast privatization when the father was president.
  </p>
<p>
   In 2008, Talaat Moustafa was recognized guilty of having paid 2 million dollars to a former policeman to kill the Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim. The other main shareholders of the Talaat Moustafa group are the Bin Laden family of Saudi Arabia.
  </p>
<p>
   In February, the company concluded a partnership agreement with the investment company of the United Ame Arab Emirates for the construction of a new and vast tourist city in Ras El-Hikma, on the Mediterranean coast, west of Alexandria. The 35 billion dollar operation, including the sale of land by the army, will greatly help the government of Sisi to pay the 42 billion dollars of debts and the interest it will have to pay this year. There are many questions raised, including the feasibility of the project, its environmental cost, the true value of the land, how to have the ownership of the army, what is the opinion of the local residents (who have not been consulted) e What checks will be on future profits in a "free economic area".
  </p>
<p>
   The desperate need for foreign currency of the Sisi government forced him to sell assets owned by the state. Ras El-Hikma adds to the growing list of Egyptian companies and land now under the property and control of the Gulf.
  </p>
<p>
   The serious inequalities, corruption and brutal repression of the opposition of the regime of the former president Hosni Mubarak have continued, and even increased, under Sisi. Recent strikes and workers' protests could mark the beginning of a new wave of actions of the working class, such as the one developed in the last years of Mubarak.
  </p>
<p>
   The awakening of the Egyptian working class could be a powerful factor to end the Gaza crisis, open the Rafah's pass to humanitarian aid and encourage workers and the poor of the whole Middle East and North Africa to dirty their mega-round rulers throughout the region.
  </p>
<p>
   To end capitalist poverty, war and destruction of the environment, it is necessary to build independent unions and workers' parties with socialist, democratic and internationalist programs.
