      The 
 March 18, 1871
     </b>
     The first great experience of power was born 
 of the proletariat, the Municipality of Paris. The Municipality of Paris lasted 
 two months and ten days, from March 18 to May 28, but these two 
 months have marked the whole history of humanity.

     ". He writes at the end: 
 “Paris worker, with its municipality, will be celebrated forever, such as 
 the glorious herald of a new society. His martyrs have for 
 Urn the big heart of the working class. Its exterminators, the 
 history has already nailed them to that eternal pillory from which not 
 All the prayers of their priests will be able to redeem them. "

     There 
 Municipality of Paris to be defeated there is an entire army, 
 days and days of massacres. There were more than 30 thousand commonards 
 killed and among these also many women and children. 45 thousand followed 
 arrests, tens of thousands of convictions - many transformed into 
 Kills - and deportations, while thousands of Parisians fled 
 abroad. In those days there was a river of blood flowing

     But 
 Lenin says: "The memory of the fighters of the municipality is honored 
 not only by the French workers, but also by the proletariat of the whole 
 world, because it did not fight for a local goal or 
 strictly national, but for the emancipation of all humanity 
 worker, of all the humiliated and offended. As a fighter

 The rhombus of the Paris cannons has awakened from their deep sleep 
 the most backward layers of the proletariat and gave a everywhere 
 impulse to revolutionary socialist propaganda. For this the 
 cause of the municipality is not dead, so it continues to live up to 
 Today in each of us. The cause of the Municipality is the cause of the 
 social revolution is the cause of complete political emancipation 
 And the economic of the workers, it is the cause of the world proletariat. AND

 Engels clearly explains the proletarian character of the government of the

 Then also Lenin also sees the weaknesses, the limits of this first

 that the Communardi had been too much "

 When the representatives of the government, of the state were to pursue, 
 the bourgeois who ran away to Versailles and reorganized for

     One

      From 
 This experience that Marx theorizes the need for dictatorship of 
 proletariat
     </b>
     . The proletariat cannot only take power, 
 To keep it, he must exercise a dictatorship towards the bourgeoisie who 
 he defeated, otherwise the bourgeoisie organizes himself and resumes his own 
 candies. And precisely from the great lessons of this short but intense 
 first experience of the proletariat who was born the need for 
 dictatorship of the proletariat.

    <span>
     Another one 
 important lesson that Marx and Engels draw is the problem of 
 State.
     <b>
      The bourgeois state is not enough to take it from the class 
 worker in his own hands and transform it, but it must be reversed and 
 build a new state, totally different, compared to the principles, 
 to the class it represents. And the Municipality began to do this.

     For 
 The revolutionary communists, for the avant -garde workers the Municipality 
 It must be more alive than ever. This great first experience of the 
 working class provides theoretical, political, ideological lessons, e 
 practices that show that
     <b>
      The proletariat has only one solution 
 conquest of political power with the revolution,
     </b>
     and that with 
 power in his own hands the proletariat with his "decrees" 
 addresses and solves fundamental problems of the masses in a few days 
 which today seem unresolved.
