 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The economic press of yesterday's newspapers reported that to 
 Unilever Group of 59.6 billion, the new management to conquer 
 the trust of investors and recover profit margins, has 
 declared the intention to slide the ice cream section, a sector 
 seasonal and with a more complex logistics. And to prepare a 
 7500 jobs cut.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In its 
 simplicity this political economic news opens up to a great 
 truth that today is useful to return to the fact that interests 
 of the masters are antagonists, irreconcilable to those of the workers, 
 of all proletarians. Simplicity of course does not mean trivial, 
 We can see it if from another point of view we observe the state 
 of the working class today.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Individualism 
 does enormous damage into factories, a way of being and thinking 
 that the workers have absorbed and that leads to say: “The struggle puts 
 At risk the workplace or mortgage, I have to think about mine 
 situation".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is life 
 In the capitalist society that is at risk, that should 
 scare. We die of profit, poverty, for racism. There is not 
 a sector, an aspect of life, working, social, cultural, 
 that the popular masses cross, that it is saved, that it is not hard, a 
 frightening risk or under attack of the reaction. And today still 
 more in the general trend to a global enlargement of conflicts 
 with the enemy of our house, imperialist and modern fascist, 
 Meloni government, which drags us every day that passes into these 
 wars.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In statistics 
 For poverty, workers who do not do 
 they do more to reach

 the end of the month. The increase in prices is 
 certified especially in the food sector. It is spent more and 
 A quantity of minor expenditure takes home, and these cuts, which 
 They are real privations, the proletarians make them heavily 
 also on one's health.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Cuts, 
 privatization, increase in costs, structures under organic, when 
 they are not closed, they make you sick, they make you die for lack of 
 prevention, of care. And what to say about 
 House, work, social services, school?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this is 
 closely connected to the factory, how the class acts e 
 reacts in the great factories, to the need for political work 
 in factories.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In factory today 
 Bourgeois ideology submits workers to production 
 capitalist, he makes them "stay in his own shell", to use the 
 Words of a worker. How do you feel different from others if you talk about 
 politics, war, investments in government bonds up to 
 € 50,000, which were excluded from the ISEE by the new government, if 
 Do proposals look at you like an alien.
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “Everything here 
 added you are still well " - it is said - the salary and the place 
 fixed they produced a poisoned fruit. Each for themselves and everyone 
 We pay, submitted to the living and work conditions imposed by 
 capitalist system that has its center in large factories. 
 Factories where the response level is low, even to attacks 
 directed to working conditions, in the salary, instead of work, 
 to health and safety, union rights, the plans of 
 renovation or relocation that touch all aspects.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Accomplice 
 the absence of a confederal opposition union movement, the 
 his action is of control over workers instead of challenging their interests. Action that overall 
 feeds the subordination and passivity of the workers. I'm a 
 example of this the trade union agreements that bind the salary and the 
 productivity, and often also safety, to the promotion of funds 
 supplementary for pensions and healthcare rather than the defense of services 
 public, disputes on words of renounced and confined orders 
 to the single factory. And clearly, even more, the absence of 
 Activities against the government, against war, for Palestine.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

 Communist.

  An instrument of 
 This work is the counter -information rossusaia which now comes out how 
 Online and weekly newspaper, printed and spread to the concierge. 
 In the current situation, in which the forces are limited, the militants 
 They are few, this means in concrete terms 
 to the workers the general political situation, the situation of all 
 the classes of the population, the situation of the movements that yes 
 translates into knowledge for the workers of what really happens, to make it food of class political consciousness. And among these, 
 As he also remembered in the first part of the counter -information of 
 Today, today there is solidarity alongside the Resistance 
 Palestinian who cannot be missing in the activity towards the workers, who 
 must not submit to the backward part, perhaps to earn a 
 easy mass consensus, that is, without breaking with positions 
 current.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Other 
 Indispensable instrument is the workers' training, training 
 ideological to fight against the dominance of bourgeois ideology 
 inside the class, as we have seen, against the cult of the 
 spontaneity that suffocates the development of proletarian consciousness.

 In the fo we are 
 resuming and using Lenin's text what to do? as a weapon 
 basic for the fight against economism, which also affects today in 
 decisive way in separating the communists from the avant -garde 
 worker and the workers' avant -gardes by the communists. The economism is the 
 primacy of the union struggle on political struggle, the primacy 
 of the trade union organization on political organization. A job 
 study to be applied to the activity, to our activity, the 
 theory as part of the battle, where the militants are also 
 tools and target of the theoretical struggle, militants who incur 
 In errors also spontaneously than curbing the development of consciousness, as can also be understood by Lenin's steps that puts in 
 guard regarding the union struggle and political struggle.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Dice Lenin:
  <i>
   “There are two policies, tradunionist policy and politics 
 social democratic, given that economists do not deny the absolute 
 politics but continually deviate from the Social Democratic conception, 
 that is, revolutionary, towards the tradunionist conception of the 
 politics, the union conception of politics. And it is not about 
 give the same economic struggle or that to the struggle 
 economic is already political struggle and that this is the 
 method of leading to workers to politics through claims 
 tangible, on the contrary. The revolutionary take advantage of the agitation 
 economic not only to present claims of all kinds, 
 but also first of all to claim the suppression of the regime 
 autocratic
  </i>
  ”.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Today, in this 
 march context towards a modern fascist regime, everything 
 it becomes politics and therefore training as a guide becomes necessary 
 to action and compared to the tasks of revolutionary policy, 
 Class agitation, propaganda, organization. Without doing the 
 our part for a systematic party study as we can do 
 the battle and bring the problem of training between the class 
 worker who, as Marx says, has a successful element, the 
 number, but the number does not weigh on the scale except when united 
 In community and is guided by knowledge? Because political activity, work for the proletarian revolution of the party 
 Communist MLM is the purpose of our struggles we organize, the reporting of the counter -information and crosses 
 All tools of daily activity.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Training is one 
 study agent, linked to daily practice, which allows 
 at the forefront of taking a step forward. Today the current problem is not to do 
 The revolution, but embody the first step to take it. The first step 
 It is to build the avant -garde forged by the theory and the program 
 necessary to do it. And that in the fire of the struggle in close link 
 with the workers and the masses, it is able to transform these books 
 in a practical tool, in an indication that gives us strength 
 necessary to reverse the course of a horrible world e 
 undertake the real struggle for a new world, founded on 
 reversal of the dominant classes and the construction of proletarian power, popular with its most advanced class, the working class, the one that 
 It can really change production, the social system and build 
 a state suitable for transforming the economy into economics to the service of the 
 people. A socialist economy.
