   What happened.
   <b>
    The University of Turin, first at Italian, has decided to suspend the collaboration with Israeli academic realities
   </b>
   . 
  «The senate of the University considers participation in the 
 Call of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Maeci), given the continuation 
 of the war situation in Gaza ». Communication is configured as 
 a partial victory for the student collectives who

    They first blocked the meeting of the senators and then obtained a public assembly

 Israeli universities. After a long discussion, the leaders 
 of the University have decided to

    The Minister of University and Research Anna Maria Bernini
   </b>
   : "That 
  of the University of Turin is a decision that I do not share albeit 
 assumed in the context of the autonomy of the universities. It is sad that 
 a similar choice coincides with the first national day of 
 University that has as its title: "Open doors". And it is frankly 
 disconcerting that one could think of closing them. I consider every form of 
 exclusion or boycott wrong and extraneous to tradition and 
 culture of our universities that have always been inspired by the opening e 
 to inclusion ".
