     Yesterday 
  In Bologna, university students had protested in front of the 
 Academic Senate to ask for the end of the censorship against 
 those who mobilize against the war in Palestine, to demand the 
 boycott of agreements with Israel and the military sector 
 industrial.

   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     The 
  Academic Senate refused to terminate the agreements in the field 
 military and war, expressing himself with yet another vaga formula e 
 smoky, substantially reiterating the need to respect the 
 regulations and the ethical code which, as regards the dual use, yes 
 I limit to "minimizing any damage" ...

   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
    <span>
     We want 
  And we demand a concrete commitment of the University that goes to terminate 
  All agreements with the Leonardo group, with NATO and with the partners 
 of the Zionist government of Israel ”wrote the 
 Students to change the course of the Bolognese university.

     The 
  mobilizations in our country show that getting the boycott is 
  possible and we can do it only through the struggle, as happened yesterday 
 to the academic Senate of the University of Turin, where thanks to the 
 mobilization has been able to obtain non -participation 
 of the Torinese University to the new Maeci of cooperation tender between Italy and 
 Israel".
