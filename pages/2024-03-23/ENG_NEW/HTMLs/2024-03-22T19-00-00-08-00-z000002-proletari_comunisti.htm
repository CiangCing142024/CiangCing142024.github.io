  We want to put in the center 
 Some aspects behind the mobilization for Palestine 
 which developed in our country and which collects a whole series 
 of necessity and indications compared to what is the perspective 
 international peoples to free themselves from imperialism against the 
 war plans and the imperialist war and the genocide that take place 
 in Palestine, but which also take place in other countries, where they are, e 
 Popular wars develop.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Palestine is 
 an opportunity for proletarians, for the communist forces and is part 
 of the work that we must also carry on in our country for 
 unmasking what is behind us, the inhumanity of this 
 imperialist/capitalist system that must be reduced because O 
 socialism or barbarism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Every day the 
 Palestine gives us this indication. Until where this comes 
 imperialist system that performs the worst crimes and performs them 
 daily towards the masses, towards the proletarians, towards the peoples who 
 they raise their heads.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is why today is 
 it is necessary to continue the mobilizations against the genocide of the people 
 Palestinian. And you must never lose sight of - and forget - 
 why this genocide takes place by Israel and the 
 coverage of imperialism mainly uses, but also the 
 complicity of many other imperialist countries, including ours 
 government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This genocide 
 It takes place as an response to the resistance action of 7 
 October. On October 7th he has
  <span>

 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 indicated the way to all peoples who 
 The only solution is to raise your head and fight with everyone 
 The means necessary for liberation from apartheid, Zionism, 
 generated by the imperialist system.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Palestinians do not 
 They are as the "beautiful souls" of the movement or parties would like 
 reformists who always want them as passive victims of the domain 
 Israeli colonial, but the great action of October 7 of the forces 
 of the Resistance has put the use of violence by the party at the center 
 of the oppressed, of the colonized, in their struggle for theirs 
 Liberation against the oppressors. And this is frightening to all 
 governments and imperialist bourgeois in the world.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So there is a 
 link between resistance and imperialist war, within a 
 International context of crisis of imperialism and its 
 attempt to get out through the interimperialist wars, while i 
 oppressed peoples, the exploited, the proletarians, the workers do not have 
 nothing to lose that their chains and organize their war of 
 people to wipe out governments, imperialist states at the service of 
 profits of the masters.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  When peoples 
 they break the monopoly of the violence of the bourgeoisie, this is afraid 
 Because the spectrum of its end is agitated as a parasitic class.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We, in this 
 General, international context, and within our country, 
 We have to do our part of communists. Particularly in ours 
 country, in the perspective that the example of the Palestinian resistance is 
 The resistance that also serves here in Italy. Palestine is 
 The example of the peoples who fight. The liberation of the people 
 Palestinian is the liberation of all the oppressed. We have to go down 
 in the square with this spirit, bring it to the mobilizations to tie 
 solidarity to the Palestinian people, to the fight against those who all 
 days it does not give us guarantees: to workers, the work, to young people 
 of the future, to students only school-schools.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are in 
 means of this movement of Palestine to bring us the 
 our contribution, our proposals for this struggle to become 
 more and more effective and becomes more and more a political struggle against 
 The fascist government Meloni, against today's business committee 
 of the imperialist bourgeoisie who is doing business and is an accomplice 
 with weapons and is an active accomplice of the genocide and is one of the 
 Greater sponsors of Netanyahu and the fascist/Nazisionist government 
 Israeli.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For this they are 
 Solidarity committees for Palestine necessary, in which the 
 Palestine support forces must join the committees and the 
 Palestinian associations on the path of internamentalism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Just as it is 
 Also in the center also the battle for a delegation 
 international that starts those who are also the 
 Responsibility of imperialist governments, such as the Italian one.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These words 
 phase order are necessary after the mobilization of 23 and 24 
 February at national level: the strike day of the 23rd who has 
 seen a part of workers take the field, particularly in the 
 logistics alongside Palestinian solidarity and the day of 
 24 with a large event in Milan compacting a part 
 of the forces that define themselves in communist, antimperialist, classy, 
 solidarity with the struggle and resistance of the Palestinian people, without 
 if and without but.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

  Of all this 
 perhaps the Meloni government is more aware of it than in these weeks 
 It is no coincidence that after these initiatives of 23 and 24, he replies by raising the 
 level of repression, how the leaf frame has happened 
 with which one would like to define terrorist who struggles for liberation 
 of their people: Anan, Mansur, Ali, is a precise message that the 
 government wants to send to intimidate all the forces of the Palestinians e 
 of the solidarity that have mobilized.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But there 
 they will be able to extend and be more and more 
 incisive in work, in every place, in every city where we are 
 present, because there are increasingly appropriate mobilizations to 
 These developments. This is what we are doing, even in the 
 Specific reality of Bergamo.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One of 
 main issues is to return to the factories, it is that 
 to return to the workers to make them deploy, to make him take 
 position, to actually take the field, to try to 
 explain the link between Palestine/War/Government, because the 
 Palestine resistance is our best ally against one 
 war that returns home and that is generating a regime of 
 modern fascism, of repression, of increase in the deaths at work, of 
 not satisfaction of any need of the masses, health, of 
 work, of the future and perspective. Only war.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fact ours 
 Government is at war in the Red Sea against the people 
 Palestinian. For this we support and operate because the 
 initiatives, direct actions of reporting, mobilization against 
 university and their ties with Israel, against factories such as the 
 Leonardo or many others that in Italy produce weapons that are given 
 To carry out the massacre in Palestine, against a fascist government that 
 prohibits the manifestations and passes out to be in defense of the semutes, 
 Just him who represents the black thread of this country. To the government 
 In Italy there are the friends of the Nazis, those who say that the 
 Jews must be put to the stake and want to silence the movement 
 of the struggle of the Palestinians. Today in Italy there is a government that pushes 
 to war, to the imperialist war, for the interests of the great 
 weapons and all that is connected with the clash 
 cheap in place worldwide: oil and gas.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There is not only the 
 Leonardo, there is Eni, there is the Tenaris Dalmine who provides the pipes 
 To pierce in front of Gaza and take away oil to the Palestinians e 
 give it to the Israelis. These are all connivances that must be 
 reported and broken.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are part 
 of all the oppressed peoples, of the proletarians who want to build the 
 their right war to end it with these unjust wars, with 
 These wars that enrich few for profit and lead us 
 misery, exploitation, fascism and repression in 
 All countries in which they are present.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The best help 
 To the Palestinian people is to hit our government and everyone 
 his dirty interests, of the masters of the multinationals of 
 arms factories, but also to contrast the lies of lies of the 
 press, of the alleged media, of the whole apparatus of the State and the 
 its institutions that want to do nothing but equate the struggle 
 of Palestinians as as anti -Semitic, when in reality they are 
 making a new holocaust, because this imperialist system is 
 founded on the abuse of human dignity, on cancellation 
 of the rights of the peoples, on the cancellation of the rights of 
 workers and their lives to always keep them in slavery.
