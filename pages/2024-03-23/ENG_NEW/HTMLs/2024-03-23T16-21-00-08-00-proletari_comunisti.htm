   NEW YEARS!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   Newroz is the symbol of the
revolt of the exploited and oppressed peoples against the oppressors
and exploiters in the thousands of years of class societies in our
geography. Today, it has become the name of the rebellion and
resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people,
against the persecution of cruelty, the rebellion of the blacksmith
Kawa against the cruel and massacring Dehaks, and the burning of the
fires of rebellion in all four corners.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   We are welcoming Newroz in a
period in which the attacks and massacres of the cruel Dehaks are
increasing worldwide and in our geography. We are in a process where
the conditions for a new imperialist sharing war are maturing and
preparations are being made for it. The increasing rivalry of the
imperialist bourgeoisie is triggering conflicts and occupations at
the regional level. There are not only rivalries and "trade
wars" between the imperialist blocs. The possibility of direct
military confrontation is also increasing. As Russia's war of
occupation of Ukraine evolves into a "protracted war"  war
between the imperialist camps, some spokespersons of the bourgeoisie
make statements that "we must be ready for war".
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   The increasing rivalry between
imperialist monopolies is increasing the aggression of reactionary
forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of
the crisis
   <span>
   </span>
  </span>

  for their own interests, to expand their areas of
domination and to hold positions. After the Azerbaijani reactionary
occupation of Artsakh-Nagorno-Karabakh, the attacks launched by
Israeli Zionism, citing the October 7 Flood of the Palestinian
national resistance, turned into genocide. The oppressed Palestinian
people were confronted with a new Nakba (catastrophe).
  <span>
  </span>
 </span>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   The Turkish state, one of the
most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression
against the Kurdish nation with daily terrorist attacks on the
territory of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria-Rojava
and invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. It is preparing for a
comprehensive invasion attack to liquidate the gains of the Rojava
Revolution and to eliminate the heavy military losses it suffered in
Iraqi Kurdistan. While liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement, the Turkish state is aiming for occupation and then
annexation in the region. It wants to realize its centuries-old
"Misak-ı Milli" goal with the approval of the imperialists
and with its own collaborator reactionary lines in the region.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   For this purpose, after
negotiations with the reactionary forces of the region, a bargain was
struck at the door of US imperialism. The fascist Turkish Republic's
traditional policy of "taking advantage of the contradictions
between the imperialist camps" is once again in effect. Once
again, preparations are being made to attack the oppressed peoples of
our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the isolation
policy is being implemented on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners,
especially Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrest attacks
against revolutionaries continue.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   The reason for this aggression
of the Turkish fascism is not independent of the situation it is in.
The century-old regime of oppression and exploitation is in a picture
of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we have
witnessed in the Earthquakes of February 6, while tens of thousands
of people are waiting for help under the debris, they were faced with
a reality of an enemy of the people who did nothing and prevented
those who go to help. The government, which responded to the people's
call for help from the mouth of R.T. Erdogan himself with the curses
"You're immoral, you're despicable, you're dishonorable";
At the current stage, he is once again asking for votes from the
people. The general elections did not solve the crisis of the ruling
classes and even failed to postpone it. At the current stage, they
are once again struggling for rent sharing, this time on the occasion
of local elections.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   While the ruling classes
continue to fight for rent and cliques within themselves, the poverty
of workers and laborers is increasing. Dozens of workers are murdered
every other day in workplace murders. There is an increase in
massacres and hate crimes against women and other gender identities.
Massacres of nature and the environment for the sake of capitalist
rent and plunder continue at full speed. The policy of annihilation,
denial, assimilation and oppression against oppressed nationalities
and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policies
implemented by fascism to maintain its power have created a situation
of social insanity in which torturous massacres of stray animals are
committed.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   Turkish state fascism, facing
this picture it has created with its government and opposition, does
what it knows best, fueling racism and chauvinism, under the name of
"social values", it increases its fascist oppression
against "those who are not like itself" and in reality
against all segments that do not obey it. Sunni Islam, the dominant
belief of Turkish fascism, is used as a means of oppressing different
beliefs and to prevent the working and laboring people from rebelling
against the conditions of hunger and poverty they are forced into.
While the policy of "Prayers for Palestine, Ships for Israel"
is continued with determination, fascist aggression against those who
do not bow their heads continues.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   Today's cruel Dehaks are at
work. They continue their robbery, extortion and massacres against
the people of the region, especially the people of our country, for
their own wealth and riches. They are preparing new invasions and
attacks for the survival of their regimes built on corruption and
theft. However, there are and will always be blacksmith Kawas against
the cruel Dehaks.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span>
   It is time to be the
blacksmith Kawa against the cruel Dehaks. Now is the time to resist
and struggle. Now is the time to stand up against the oppressors.
