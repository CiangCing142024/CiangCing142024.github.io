  <strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  KP Sharma Oli, Chairman of the CPN-UML, has dismissed speculations regarding his party’s potential entry into the Socialist Front of Nepal. This came following a discussion with Prime Minister and Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre), Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
 </p>
 <p>
  Contrary to earlier reports suggesting UML’s integration into the Socialist Front of Nepal, Chairman Oli clarified the party’s stance, refuting any such plans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The decision came after a meeting between PM Dahal and Chairman Oli, where the matter was deliberated upon.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the Socialist Front’s earlier decision to extend an invitation to the CPN-UML, Chairman Oli’s statement firmly denies the possibility.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Socialist Front of Nepal, formed on June 19, 2023, comprises four parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand.
 </p>
 <p>
  With a collective representation of 54 lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the parties affiliated to the newly established Socialist Front of Nepal have made their presence felt in the political arena.
