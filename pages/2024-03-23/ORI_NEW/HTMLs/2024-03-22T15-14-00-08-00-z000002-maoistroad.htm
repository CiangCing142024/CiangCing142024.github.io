   Ready for war." This is what the German army is should become 
again. For this, the Ministry of Defense, which reports to the german 
defense minister Boris Pistorius, has now presented a concept paper as a
 proposal in which initial measures are set out to drive forward in the 
rearmament of the german military
  </p>
  <p>
   The document is entitled "Bundeswehr of the Future". Bundeswehr is 
the name of the german military. The document lists various points that 
need to be implemented in order to make the German army "fit for war" 
again. One of these points is the strengthening of the military 
branches. Military branches are a part of the armed forces divided into 
various specialized areas. In Germany, the military comprises three 
branches. The army, navy and air force. In the future, however, there 
will also be a fourth branch of the armed forces, which concerns the 
area of "cyber and information space".
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition, there will also be restructuring in the command of 
operations aimed at strengthening centralization. An "operational 
leadership command of the Bundeswehr" is to be created in future. All 
Bundeswehr operations, whether at home or abroad, would then be 
centrally controlled and coordinated by this command.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, under the motto: "The Bundeswehr as a whole must be 
geared towards an emergency", it is demanded that the Bundeswehr must be
 put in a logistical position to be able to make war at any time.
   <br/>
   To
 this end, the military administration should already be planning ahead 
for "emergencies". Accordingly, requirements such as infrastructure, 
personnel, material, etc. should be identified and made available.
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if only in passing, the document also raises the issue of 
military conscription. The document proposes structural and process 
changes, particularly in the area of personnel. The structures should 
operate "largely smoothly" and "especially in
   <br/>
   situations of extreme turmoil and great coordination effort on the part of the state
   <br/>
   be
 able to fold up." To this purpose, a coordination center is also to be 
created to "control the personnel growth capability". This should be in a
 position to "quickly ensure that personnel requirements are met". In 
other words, in the case of war, they conscript masses of young people 
as cannon fodder for the German bourgeoisie.
  </p>
  <p>
   The creation of such a coordination office is also relevant for a 
future reintroduction of a compulsory military service. It is well known
 that the German Minister of Defense, or one could rather say Minister 
of War, Pistorius, is a vehement campaigner for the reintroduction of 
compulsory military service. In this context, it also makes sense that 
he is calling for the creation of structures that would be able to 
operate immediately after the introduction of such military 
conscription.
  </p>
  <p>
   Ultimately, it can be said that the German bourgeoisie is 
increasingly calling for war.Â  The introduction to the above-mentioned 
document already makes it clear, that it is not about using the german 
military as a defensive army.
  </p>
  <p>
   So they write:
   <br/>
   "Germany, as a globally networked nation in all 
respects, will therefore have to be able to counter threats and 
destabilization at home, in Europe and in the world at all times in the 
future. To this end, the Bundeswehr also provides politicians with 
instruments for action."
  </p>
  <p>
   Even if there is always talk of "defending" Germany, it is much more 
about defending the economic interests of German imperialism with fire 
and steel all over the world against the oppressed people and 
imperialist competitors. A fact that is confirmed by germanys actual 
military operations.
