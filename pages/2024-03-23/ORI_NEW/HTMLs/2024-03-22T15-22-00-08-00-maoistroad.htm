   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central 
Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and 
others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to
 celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit
 and enthusiasm.
 </p>
 <p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies
 upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose
 the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize 
Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the 
imperialist forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson 
for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India 
(Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical 
Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
 <p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat 
Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” 
Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack 
the freedom movement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, 
accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating 
exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, 
Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation 
through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged 
promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and 
socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.
