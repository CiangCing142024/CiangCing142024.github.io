  reciente, 1’1 millones de personas, la mitad de la población de Gaza, está experimentando “una catastrófica inseguridad alimenticia”, la 5ª y última fase de la Clasificación Integral de Seguridad Alimenticia (IPC). La población entera en Gaza, 2’23 millones de personas se están enfrentando una aguda inseguridad alimenticia. El resto de la población está mayoritariamente en la fase 4 de “emergencia” mientras algunas áreas en la fase 3 “crisis”.

  En el norte de Gaza, la aguda carencia de comida está excediendo el techo de lo que sería considerado hambruna, y la aguda desnutrición probablemente haya excedido los límites de la hambruna, y las muertes por inanición pronto llegarán a los límites de la hambruna declarada. De acuerdo con un agente de la ONU, la situación ha llevado a que más de

  de inanición en las últimas semanas. Las proyecciones del IPC son que el norte de Gaza empezará a sufrir hambruna en cualquier momento entre mayo y ahora. El sur de Gaza empezará la hambruna en julio.

En total al menos 31.726 personas han sido asesinadas por el Estado de Israel desde el inicio de la actual campaña genocida.

  Mientras los imperialistas actúan como si lo que ocurriese en Gaza fuese algún tipo de desastre natural, donde lo único que intentan hacer es dar una pequeña ayuda, lo que está pasando no es un misterio. Incluso agentes de la ONU, dominada por el imperialismo yanqui, dicen
  <a href="https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1770068341551452168">
   implícitamente
  </a>
  que el Estado de Israel están usando la inanición como arma de guerra.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b25d60692723c5acf97a3cc9e0b002a6">
  Las leyes de guerra, las cuákes los imperialistas niegan regularmente a menos que sirvan a sus intereses, están claramente definidas y son bien conocidas por todos los soldados de cualquier ejército. Las rupturas de estas leyes son consideradas crímenes de guerra.
  <a href="https://www.icrc.org/es/doc/resources/documents/treaty/treaty-gc-4-5tdkyk.htm">
   El Artículo 55
  </a>
  de la Cuarta Convención de Ginebra declara claramente que el Estado de Israel es responsable de las necesidades del pueblo bajo su ocupación:
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-325fb4ad8e1e3783f219ec00eff58b9e">
  “
  <em>
   En toda la medida de sus recursos, la Potencia ocupante tiene el deber de abastecer a la población en víveres y productos médicos; deberá, especialmente, importar víveres, medicamentos y cualquier otro artículo necesario cuando sean insuficientes los recursos del territorio ocupado.”
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1b8957417381caed71362d68c1ed7cc7">
  Los hechos sobre la situación en Gaza, muestran claramente que el Estado de Israel está cometiendo un crimen de guerra rompiendo esta ley.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-24ebad4b1b808d34ca6ffb0520f03bb5">
  El 26 de enero la Corte Internacional de Justicia (ICJ) hizo una
  <a href="https://icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20240126-ord-01-00-en.pdf">
   declaración preliminar,
  </a>
  que decía lo siguiente:
  <em>
   “El Estado de Israel debe, de acuerdo con sus obligaciones bajo la Convención sobre la Prevención y Castigo del Crimen de Genocidio, en relación con los palestinos en Gaza, tomar todas las medidas en su mano para evitar la comisión de todos los actos de cara a lo dicho en el Artículo II de esta convención.”

  <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/israel-government-continues-block-aid-response-despite-icj-genocide-court-ruling">
   denunciado
  </a>
  esto a pesar que el criterio del ICJ es que Israel sigue bloqueando la ayuda a Gaza de forma deliberada. Entre los varios métodos, el Estado de Israel lo hace de la siguiente forma: bloqueando la ayuda creando cuellos de botella sólo permitiendo la ayuda a través de dos cruces; imponiendo un sistema de inspección burocrática el cuál retrasa los camiones, de media durante 20 días; y rechazando los suministros necesarios como combustible, generadores, material protector y equipamiento de comunicaciones, afirmando que esto sólo puede ser usado con propósitos militares.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b339d147e4593f1a5603bb38acb049be">
  Pero no sólo descuidando el proveer a la población ocupada con los suministros necesarios, también bloqueando a otras partes de hacerlo, el Estado de Israel está comiendo también un crimen de guerra incumpliendo el Artículo 23 de la Cuarta Convención de Ginebra. Este artículo requiere a los Estados que “el libre paso de todo envío de medicamentos y de material sanitario” para los civiles y “Permitirá, asimismo, el libre paso de todo envío de víveres indispensables, de ropa y de tónicos reservados para los niños de menos de quince años y para las mujeres encintas o parturientas.”
  <a href="https://www.icrc.org/es/document/protocolo-i-adicional-convenios-ginebra-1949-proteccion-victimas-conflictos-armados-internacionales-1977">
   El párrafo 2 del artículo 70
  </a>
  del Protocolo Adicional para las Convenciones amplía esta obligación:
  <em>
   “2. Las Partes en conflicto y las Altas Partes contratantes permitirán y facilitarán el paso rápido y sin trabas de todos los envíos, materiales y personal de socorro suministrados de acuerdo con lo dispuesto en esta Sección, incluso en el caso de que tal asistencia esté destinada a la población civil de la Parte adversa.”

</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-3bc6ebec3890468b3fe4295ca7a75da6">
  El párrafo 1 del Artículo 54 del Protocolo Adicional I a las Convenciones de Ginebra define el uso de la inanición como arma de guerra, como crimen de guerra:
  <em>
   “
  </em>
<em>
   1. Queda prohibido, como método de guerra, hacer padecer hambre a las personas civiles.”
  </em>
  Posteriormente en el párrafo 2 del mismo artículo, establece que:
  <em>
   “2. Se prohíbe atacar, destruir, sustraer o inutilizar los bienes indispensables para la supervivencia de la población civil, tales como los artículos alimenticios y las zonas agrícolas que los producen, las cosechas, el ganado, las instalaciones y reservas de agua potable y las obras de riego, con la intención deliberada de privar de esos bienes, por su valor como medios para asegurar la subsistencia, a la población civil o a la Parte adversa, sea cual fuere el motivo, ya sea para hacer padecer hambre a las personas civiles, para provocar su desplazamiento, o con cualquier otro propósito.”

  Mientras ignoran los obvios crímenes de guerra cometidos por el Estado de Israel, los imperialistas, actuando como si se tratase de un desastre natural, intentan dar la impresión de que ellos quieren ayudar al pueblo de Gaza con medidas insuficientes como lanzamientos aéreos de material.

  </a>
  tras fallar los paracaídas, siguen siendo una gota en el océano para los hambrientos palestinos. El imperialismo alemán ha desplegado dos aviones de transporte para lanzar ayuda sobre Gaza, sin embargo estos aviones sólo pueden transportar 18 toneladas cada uno. Esto es menos que la capacidad de un camión, que suele llevar alrededor de 20 toneladas. Mientras la población de Gaza necesita alrededor de 500 camiones de ayuda cada día, sólo han entrado en Gaza 2.874 camiones en febrero, menos de 100 por día. La tendencia actual es que esta cantidad de ayuda está decreciendo.

  Il Mediterraneo,  l’Africa e il Medioriente sono l’altro fronte
di guerra acceso dalla contesa interimperialista, con le truppe
militari dei governi imperialisti sul terreno a rafforzare l’asse
del terrore, assieme al loro alleato sionista, contro i popoli arabi
con al centro la Palestina.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Questo
fronte di guerra è strategico per lo Stato imperialista italiano, ce
lo stanno ripetendo fino alla nausea i governi e i cosiddetti
“analisti” vicini all’apparato militare-industriale Italiano, e
il governo Meloni/Crosetto/Tajani è proprio sull’interventismo
imperialista italiano che punta molto, la Meloni lo ha gonfiato
talmente tanto da spingere la stampa asservita a battezzarlo “piano
Mattei”, a dargli così una veste apparentemente strategica per
nascondere invece la realtà fatta di respingimenti appaltati ai
governi reazionari, di profitti derivati dalla rapina delle risorse
energetiche e dalle merci che transitano nell’area, di imposizione
del tallone di ferro degli eserciti imperialisti per schiacciare le
aspirazioni dei popoli e dominare il commercio mondiale che transita
nel Mar Rosso.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  La
presidenza italiana nel G7 e le elezioni europee sono un passaggio
ulteriore per tutti i governi e i partiti
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 dell’Europa per crescere
come consenso e legittimare le loro politiche di repressione e
oppressione, sia all’interno dei rispettivi Stati imperialisti, sia
all’esterno contro i popoli.
 <p>
</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  In
questo contesto domenica 17 Marzo si è tenuta la visita al Cairo del
Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri italiano, Meloni, insieme al
Presidente della Commissione europea, von der Leyen, sempre
disponibile quando deve sostenere le politiche razziste dei
respingimenti antimmigrati in compagnia della capa del governo
Italiano (nessuno può e deve dimenticare la strage dei migranti a
Cutro, dove su quelle morti per responsabilità italiane ed europee
le due aguzzine avevano rafforzato la loro unità). Della delegazione
che puntava al rafforzamento del partenariato strategico Ue-Egitto ha
fatto parte il Presidente della Repubblica di Cipro, attuale
presidente di turno del Consiglio Ue, i Primi Ministri di Grecia e
Austria.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Sono
andati per firmare il nuovo patto Ue-Egitto, un piano da 7,4 miliardi
di euro, tra prestiti e sovvenzioni.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Il
Cairo dalla Ue è considerato "partner affidabile", un
"pilastro della sicurezza del Mediterraneo", come si legge
nella dichiarazione congiunta.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Inoltre
l’aggettivo “storico” non poteva mancare neanche questa volta
nel definire accordi politici, commerciali, militari,. Ogni passaggio
politico del governo Meloni poggia su parole vuote che ammantano la
sua politica imperialista, neocoloniale.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Questo
del partenariato europeo era una delle gambe su cui poggia il
rafforzamento imperialista del regime di al Sisi in Egitto, l’altra
sono rapporti bilaterali Italia-Egitto che si concretizzano in nuovi
Memorandum.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Con gli
accordi con Libia, Tunisia e Albania, il governo Meloni persegue alla
stessa maniera anche con l’Egitto la sua politica di impedire le
partenze dei migranti in fuga da fame e guerre con i lager dove
rinchiuderli, una politica rafforzata dal governo Meloni/Piantedosi
di criminalizzazione/repressione delle ONG impegnate nei soccorsi in
mare.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Al governo italiano,
anche in vista delle elezioni europee, interessa soprattutto la
questione migratoria. In Egitto sono presenti 9 milioni di migranti e
450 mila sono rifugiati e richiedenti asilo, di cui il 40% minori.
Metà di questi (213mila) viene dal Sudan, un paese in guerra da
ormai un anno con 7 milioni di sfollati. Il Sudan e l’evoluzione
del conflitto a Gaza hanno fatto diventare centrale il dialogo con
l’Egitto per gli imperialisti europei, anch’esso un Paese di
migranti: 11.072 sono stati gli egiziani arrivati in Italia via mare
nel 2023, prevalentemente dalla Libia. E proprio il rapporto stretto
di al Sisi con il generale Khalifa Haftar che controlla la Cirenaica,
la posizione che ha l’Egitto al confine con la Libia, il Sudan e la
Striscia di Gaza che fanno di questo Stato un puntello
dell’imperialismo nell’area Mediorientale. Per questo, e con la
collaborazione dell’Agenzia europea Frontex, gli imperialisti
vogliono irrobustire il controllo delle frontiere egiziane e
rafforzare il pattugliamento marittimo per impedire le partenze dei
migranti.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  “La crisi di Gaza
è in cima alle nostre preoccupazioni” ha detto la Meloni ma,
siccome non ha fatto assolutamente nulla per fermare il genocidio
dello Stato nazisionista israeliano contro Gaza e tutta la Palestina
occupata e bombardata, le cosiddette “preoccupazioni” sue e dei
governi sono solo per come impedire le partenze dei migranti e
soffocare l’appoggio anche armato della resistenza del popolo dello
Yemen, definito dalla stampa “ribelli Houthi”, che, in nome di
quella solidarietà con il popolo palestinese, colpisce gli interessi
dell’imperialismo che invece appoggia il terrorista n°1 dell’area,
lo Stato nazisionista di Israele e attacca le merci degli
imperialisti che passano nel Mar Rosso.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  I
regimi asserviti all’imperialismo diventano così un puntello
indispensabile e su di loro i governi imperialisti riversano fiumi di
denaro. In Italia questo lo chiamano pomposamente “piano Mattei”
e il modello di cui va orgoglioso il governo italiano è quello
siglato con la Tunisia di Saied nel settembre scorso, anch’esso,
non a caso, battezzato da Meloni e von der Leyen.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  L’incendio
della guerra – o meglio -  del genocidio in corso in Palestina da
parte dello Stato occupante naziosionista di Israele, sostenuto
dall’imperialismo occidentale con in testa gli USA e con il ruolo
attivo, complice, dell’Italia del governo Meloni, è divampato nel
Medioriente, per l’appoggio della resistenza dello Yemen alla
resistenza palestinese e con l’afflusso di armi, militari, USA/UE
nel Mar Rosso con l’obiettivo di spegnere la solidarietà politica
e militare dei popoli alla causa palestinese e per un aperto sostegno
al genocidio nazisionista.
 </p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Sostenere
al-Sisi vuol dire innanzi tutto corrergli in aiuto per sostenere
tutto l’apparato di dominio del golpista, dai militari alle banche,
che hanno messo in ginocchio il popolo egiziano a cui ora si
aggiungono le ondate migratorie da Gaza e dal Sudan, create dagli
stessi imperialisti.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  I respingimenti dei
migranti saranno uno dei temi del G7 quindi è questione centrale per
una lotta antimperialista.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  L’iniziativa
europea fa seguito al sostegno economico che l’Egitto si è
assicurato dagli Emirati Arabi Uniti e dal Fondo monetario
internazionale (Fmi). Tra la fine di febbraio e l’inizio di marzo
Il Cairo ha ricevuto 10 miliardi di dollari erogati da un fondo
emiratino. Un progetto che prevede un investimento iniziale di 35
miliardi di dollari e che consentirà di rimpinguare le casse dello
Stato, su cui hanno gravato gli effetti della guerra nella Striscia
di Gaza. Il 6 marzo scorso, l’Fmi ha annunciato di voler aumentare
da 3 a 8 miliardi di dollari il valore del prestito che erogherà
all’Egitto in cambio delle riforme economiche che, tradotto,
significa scaricare con la repressione, con l’imposizione, tutta la
politica di austerità del regime reazionario egiziano contro il suo
stesso popolo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Sulla situazione
economica egiziana grava un debito che, secondo i dati della World
Bank di settembre 2023, ammonta a 164,5 miliardi di dollari. Il tasso
di inflazione annuale è salito al 36% a gennaio, senza possibilità
di contrazione entro breve tempo – anche perché la Banca centrale
ha deciso di rendere flessibile il tasso di cambio della sterlina
egiziana (ormai scambiata a 50 per dollaro, contro i 30 medi del
2023).
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Aiutare
economicamente il golpista al Sisi significa, come contropartita,
ottenere il suo coinvolgimento nella repressione dei migranti e, per
l’imperialismo italiano, questo significa anche i profitti legati
allo sfruttamento delle risorse energetiche, argomento strategico per
i paesi imperialisti, che per questo si scannano e ci stanno
trascinando nel macello mondiale.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  In un’intervista
concessa ad “Agenzia Nova”, un’analista Roberta ha detto che
“in tale prospettiva – ha aggiunto – Roma non può prescindere
dall’Egitto sia in ragione della posizione geografica del Paese
nordafricano, sia per le sue infrastrutture, legate in particolare
alla liquefazione del gas, presenti sul suo territorio. Ciò tanto
più in ragione della possibilità, annunciata di recente, che dal
2025 l’Egitto possa aumentare di 4 miliardi di metri cubi annui le
importazioni di gas naturale proveniente dal giacimento israeliano di
Tamar attraverso un gasdotto offshore da Ashkelon a Al Arish”.
L’Egitto, dice l’esperta, “mira a diventare un hub regionale di
riferimento per il Gnl e la costruzione di un partenariato più
stretto per l’Ue e soprattutto per l’Italia risponde dunque,
senza alcun dubbio, a un’esigenza di interesse nazionale”.
D’altro canto, “la stessa presenza del primo ministro greco
potrebbe verosimilmente spiegarsi proprio con la volontà di mettere
sul tavolo del negoziato prima di tutto le tematiche legate al
settore dell’energia e dunque ai giacimenti offshore, alle
infrastrutture, al Gnl e alle Zone economiche esclusive in tutta
l’area del Mediterraneo orientale”
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Quindi non ci sono
solo i respingimenti antimmigrati in questo accordo tra Meloni e al
Sisi, c’è anche l’approvvigionamento energetico: l’ENI ha
messo le mani sul pozzo di gas naturale Nargis-1.

    NI
   </span>
</strong>
<strong>
<span style="font-weight: normal;">
    è attualmente il principale produttore in Egitto
   </span>
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
  con una produzione di idrocarburi di circa 350mila barili al
giorno. L’Egitto è diventato un hot spot per il gas dopo la
scoperta del giacimento offshore di Zohr nel 2015. Attualmente ENI

</span>
  produce circa il 60% della produzione totale di gas del Paese
nordafricano e gestisce anche l’impianto di esportazione di gas
naturale liquefatto dal porto di Damietta da 5 milioni di tonnellate
l’anno.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Per l’Italia
imperialista rappresentata dal governo Meloni si è trattato di
firmare un accordo con il golpista al Sisi proprio in coincidenza con
l’udienza del processo per la morte di Giulio Regeni, il giovane
ricercatore italiano, ucciso e torturato orribilmente dai servizi
segreti egiziani di cui è capo al Sisi, e questa udienza iniziata il
18 marzo a Roma.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Niente può mettere
in discussione le relazioni tra Italia ed Egitto, non contano né
massacri né violazioni dei diritti umani, anzi, vengono rafforzati
il business civile e, soprattutto, quello militare che è cresciuto
vertiginosamente, con al centro, come sempre, la Fincantieri e la
Leonardo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Su questo il
Presidente egiziano Al Sisi, alla presenza dell’AD di ENI, Claudio
Descalzi, dichiarò che “l’assassinio è stato commesso per
rovinare i rapporti con l’Italia” e “per danneggiare l’Egitto”
e, rivolto a Descalzi, “Sa perché volevano danneggiare le
relazioni fra Egitto ed Italia? Affinché non arrivassimo qui”. Ma
non solo sono arrivati fin qui, sono andati anche avanti.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Negli ultimi cinque
anni le industrie belliche italiane hanno esportato verso le forze
armate di al Sisi, l’ex capo dell’esercito golpista egiziano, da
poco rieletto trionfalmente per la terza volta, per il valore
complessivo di due miliardi e 39 milioni di euro. Secondo lo
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), infatti,
per il 2024 sarebbero già in ballo 3 miliardi di dollari per
l’acquisto di ventiquattro caccia Eurofighter Typhoon-2 da parte
del Cairo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  La Leonardo
dell’amministratore delegato Cingolani, ex ministro della
transizione ecologica, azienda che ha nel suo libro-paga il ministro
Crosetto, si sta sfregando le mani per l’ennesima volta.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Le industrie
belliche italiane hanno esportato alle forze armate egiziane negli
ultimi cinque anni armi per il valore complessivo di 2 miliardi e 39
milioni di euro.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Quindi, dietro la
propaganda di questo governo, c’è la sostanza della politica
imperialista italiana: profitti e respingimenti antimmigrati.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  E contro di essa è
necessaria la massima opposizione proletaria, di massa,
antimperialista, solidale con la resistenza armata dei popoli.

     Yo respondo:

<em>
     una solitaria columna de rocío?

  Durante los últimos meses se vieron afectadas más de 4 mil 326 hectáreas de tierras por terribles incendios forestales provocados por el latifundio o surgidos como fenómeno de la temporada de estiaje. Además de esto, en diversas regiones de Oaxaca como los Valles Centrales, Mixteca y Costa, principalmente, se ha observado una crisis hídrica que amenaza a poblaciones enteras, y ahora también a hospitales y escuelas públicas.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  El claro ejemplo es la situación del Hospital General “Dr. Aurelio Valdivieso”, en plena capital oaxaqueña, que el pasado 22 de febrero tuvo que suspender labores al quedarse sin agua. Evidentemente un nosocomio no puede funcionar sin brindar condiciones mínimas de salubridad para pacientes y personal médico, y para ello se hace indispensable el servicio de agua potable. Al respecto la Defensoría de Derechos Humanos del Pueblo de Oaxaca inició un cuaderno de antecedentes y dictó medidas cautelares donde pide
  <em>
   “acciones integrales al Estado que eviten producir daños de difícil o imposible reparación en detrimento al derecho a la salud de la ciudadanía”.
  </em>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Ahora, en la misma capital de la entidad, se habla de al menos 6 escuelas públicas que han debido suspender labores y retornar a las clases en línea ante el total desabasto de agua en sus instalaciones. Las más recientes han sido la Escuela Primaria Urbana Matutina “Carlos A. Carrillo”, ubicada en la Colonia Reforma, y la Escuela Primaria Matutina “Enrique Pestalozzi”, ubicada en el Centro de la Ciudad. Dejar a la niñez sin acceso al agua potable dentro de sus escuelas atenta también contra su derecho a la educación y la salud, entre otros contemplados dentro del interés superior de la niñez.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Hasta hace unas semanas el desabasto del agua potable estaba concentrado en las colonias populares generalmente ubicadas en la periferia y los cerros de la ciudad, nada nuevo. Desde hace décadas existen decenas de colonias y barrios denominados “asentamientos irregulares” donde el pueblo pobre no tiene acceso al agua potable ni otros servicios públicos; en la misma situación se encuentran cientos de escuelitas en esos mismos barrios. Los distintos gobiernos en turno han ignorado sistemáticamente esta situación, dejando la solución en manos de los pobladores que toda la vida han debido contratar pipas particulares que aprovechan la época de estiaje para especular con los precios del agua.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Pero ahora que la crisis hídrica ha llegado a la zona céntrica de la Ciudad y a las colonias “bien” como Reforma, San Felipe, etc. la situación se ha vuelto un escándalo; más aún cuando instituciones públicas visibles como el Hospital General y las escuelas antes mencionadas han debido suspender labores ante el desabasto del agua.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Paralelamente en Oaxaca, empresas refresqueras y cerveceras siguen laborando con normalidad, al igual que los grandes hoteles, restaurantes, centros de vicio e incluso balnearios que se preparan para la semana santa y el turismo bonito. A ninguno de estos les falta el agua para nada.
 </p>
<p>
  ¿Estamos ante un fenómeno de sequía o saqueo? Usted responda.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Si durante la pandemia se decretó emergencia sanitaria y suspensión de labores de esas industrias y negocios, debería hacerse lo mismo en medio de esta crisis hídrica que es también crisis sanitaria, además de regular el precio del agua que venden los piperos organizados en mafias sindicales.
 </p>
<p>
  Garantizar el acceso universal al agua potable como derecho fundamental es una necesidad vital y no así las elecciones en puerta. El dinero que se gasta en campañas y candidatos debería invertirse en sistemas comunitarios de acopio y abasto de agua para el pueblo.

<p>
  Após um acordo com o governo, o Congresso Nacional aprovou hoje um projeto do Novo Ensino Médio. O projeto passou por algumas modificações, mas manteve o essencial do conteúdo foi criticado, por meses, em greves e protestos de professores e alunos por todo o País, como centenas de horas para as disciplinas optativas sem conteúdo científico e modelos prejudiciais à formação escolar completa.
 </p>
<p>
  Dentro do aprovado pela Câmara, está:
 </p>
<ul>
<li>
   Perda de horas de formação científica: no ensino regular, a divisão será de 2.400 horas para disciplinas obrigatórias e 600 horas para as disciplinas optativas. Em outras palavras, a perda de 600 horas em disciplinas tradicionais e essenciais no Ensino Médio para os “itinerários formativos”, compostos em sua maioria, sobretudo nas escolas públicas, de disciplinas sem conteúdo científico, como “pensamento computacional”, “projeto de vida” e aberrações similares. No ensino técnico, a divisão será de 2.100 horas para disciplinas obrigatórias, com possibilidade de 300 delas serem compatibilizadas entre formação geral básica e ensino técnico, além de 1.200 horas para o curso técnico escolhido.
  </li>
<li>
   Guarda-chuva de disciplinas: fusão de diferentes disciplinas essenciais à formação do estudante em “grandes áreas”, tornadas obrigatórias. São elas: linguagens e suas tecnologias, que integra língua portuguesa e literatura; língua inglesa; artes (múltiplas linguagens e expressões); educação física; matemática e suas tecnologias; ciências da natureza e suas tecnologias, que reunirá disciplinas importantes como biologia, física e química em um único grande guarda-chuva; e ciências humanas e sociais aplicadas, que fará o mesmo com filosofia, geografia, história e sociologia.
  </li>
<li>
   Itinerários formativos: no novo projeto, cada escola regular (não técnica) deve oferecer ao menos dois itinerários formativos. Essas disciplinas optativas devem contemplar ao menos uma das áreas acima, mas não há especificação clara do quanto que conteúdo ou ementa devem estar relacionados às áreas científicas, de forma que deixa em aberto o espaço para cursos anticientíficos como os que foram massivamente implementados nas escolas que adotaram a medida no último ano; nas escolas técnicas, há a opção da formação do curso de formação técnica e profissional;
  </li>
<li>
   Formalização do Ensino à Distância: o projeto estabeleceu que os itinerários formativos podem ser ensinados à distância, enquanto a carga horária de formação geral básica pode ser ofertada de forma presencial e, excepcionalmente, de forma “mediada por tecnologia”. Ainda não há um regulamento que especifique como se dará a mediação.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Extrema-direita comemora
 </h4>
<p>
  Depois da aprovação, parlamentares da extrema-direita apressaram-se em celebrar o texto acordado entre o governo e o Congresso. O novo presidente da Comissão de Educação da Câmara, o notório reacionário Nikolas Ferreira (PL-MG), foi um dos que elogiou o projeto aprovado. Em nota publicada nas redes sociais, o deputado declarou, cinicamente, que vai manter alta a fiscalização pela aplicação da medida e às “demandas dos nossos alunos”.
 </p>
<p>
  O comentário é um escárnio descarado: a aprovação contrariou de forma direta os interesses dos alunos e professores que criticaram e condenaram o NEM em importantes mobilizações pelo País ao longo de todo o último ano. Em vez de uma reformulação no NEM, os professores e estudantes exigiam a revogação total da medida.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Mudou, mas deixou igual
 </h4>
<p>
  Na nova aprovação, todo o conteúdo criticado pelos estudantes no NEM se manteve. Em greves, ocupações estudantis e protestos, os profissionais da Educação e estudantes exigiam o fim dos “itinerários formativos” e o retorno da grade horária destinada às disciplinas regulares e condenavam a confusão generalizada causada pela fusão de múltiplas disciplinas científicas em leques amplos. O Ensino à Distância também era, via de regra, rechaçado nas manifestações. Entidades como a Executiva Nacional dos Estudantes de Pedagogia (ExNEPe), que coordenou campanhas e lutas contra o NEM, chegou a classificar a reforma como o “mais grave ataque à Educação pública dos últimos anos”.
 </p>
<p>
  Denúncias posteriores à aplicação da medida também revelam como NEM favorece a precarização do trabalho docente, com os profissionais sujeitos à exploração cada vez maior, em jornadas exaustivas e um trabalho não relacionado com suas áreas de formação, a precarização do Ensino, sobretudo do público e gratuito, com a oferta de um ensino anticientífico e pragmatista (e não ensino técnico, como propagandeiam figuras como Nikolas Ferreira), consequentemente, a evasão escolar.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Luta deve ser retomada
 </h4>
<p>
  Mesmo assim, o governo nunca de fato cogitou atender a exigência de revogar o NEM e optou pela conciliação com a medida. No mês passado, o ministro da Educação, Camilo Santana, afirmou que esperava aprovar a medida “ainda neste semestre, até porque para implementar as mudanças no Ensino Médio para 2025 precisam ser aprovadas neste semestre, porque precisa ter o tempo para que as redes se prepararem para mudanças. É fundamental a aprovação ainda neste semestre na Câmara e no Senado”.
 </p>
<p>
  Dessa forma, o clima que pode se esperar é de retomada das lutas dos estudantes contra o NEM e os vindouros ataques à Educação promovidos pelos reacionários celerados e conciliadores de plantão.

 Lenin dice che per sviluppare la coscienza politica del proletariato bisogna portare nella classe operaia la denuncia di ogni manifestazione di arbitrio e oppressione.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Ma naturalmente, si pone subito dopo il problema "Come farlo? Abbiamo forze sufficienti per farlo? Esiste un terreno per questo lavoro in tutte le altre classi? Non significherà questo o non porterà questo ad una rinuncia al punto di vista di classe?".
 </p>
<p>
  Domande ancora più giustificate se guardiamo ad oggi, alle condizioni di organizzazione, numeri e quadri dell'organizzazione comunista, e in particolare della nostra. Domande a cui la risposta facile che viene è No.
 </p>
<p>
  Ma la risposta di Lenin è invece altra. Parte dall'assunto che i comunisti sono innanzitutto "teorici... propagandisti, agitatori e organizzatori". E aggiunge: "ma si fa molto poco in questo senso. Troppo poco rispetto a quanto si fa per lo studio delle peculiarità della vita di fabbrica", anzi - diciamo noi - dell'attenzione che si presta alla vita e alle lotte degli altri settori di lavoratori. Lenin insiste che ci sono
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 compagni, comitati, ecc. che si sprofondano perfino nello studio specialistico delle lotte sindacali, mentre non fanno, o fanno in misura estremamente limitata, il lavoro che domanda Lenin per elevare effettivamente la coscienza degli operai e dei lavoratori in lotta.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  Il loro impegno profuso nelle lotte sindacali dimentica che - come dice Lenin - "non è socialdemocratico chi di fatto dimentica che i comunisti appoggiano ogni moto rivoluzionario e che, per conseguenza, noi dobbiamo esporre, sottolineare dinanzi a tutto il popolo i compiti generali, senza nascondere neppure per un momento le nostre convinzioni socialiste", ed educare nel nostro lavoro nella fabbrica e nelle lotte proletarie gli operai e il proletariato in generale ad occuparsi di tutti i problemi generali e porsi all'avanguardia di tutte le lotte politiche democratiche che si sviluppano nella società, innanzitutto, nella fase iniziale, con prese di posizione.
 </p>
<p>
  Le forze per fare questo ci sono eccome. L'alternativa che ci suggeriscono invece gli economisti e la mentalità economista nelle fila dei comunisti è quella di "sviluppare una politica tradunionista". E su questo Lenin è tassativo:
  <b>
   "La politica tradunionista della classe operaia è proprio la
   <i>
    politica borghese
   </i>
   della classe operaia".
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Perfino negli altri settori e movimenti a cui noi ci rivolgiamo, l'azione dei comunisti non consiste tanto nel dirigere la lotta per i loro interessi immediati - ad esempio la lotta degli studenti - ma nel portare in essi la posizione dei comunisti, la posizione del partito della classe operaia; perchè solo così si realizza quello che dice Lenin: "Noi dobbiamo trasformare i militanti socialdemocratici in capi politici che sappiano dirigere tutte le manifestazioni di questa lotta" e siano in grado di dettare in questa lotta "un positivo programma di azione agli studenti in agitazione, ai rappresentanti degli zemstva insoddisfatti, ai membri delle sette religiose indignati, ai maestri colpiti nei loro interessi, ecc. ".
 </p>
<p>
  Questo è essere avanguardia rivoluzionaria ed espressione dell'avanguardia operaia che abbiamo chiamato a prendere posizione, e attraverso essa cominciare a reagire a tutte le forme di oppressione politica e sociale della borghesia, del suo Stato, del suo governo.
 </p>
<p>
  Se questo è, quindi, il compito dei comunisti, permanente dei comunisti, se si comprende che questo è un compito da assolvere fin dall'inizio della nostra attività, si può comprendere bene l'attenzione che a questo punto Lenin pone sulle effettive forze che hai, e considera scontato il tipo di attività inevitabile da condurre all'inizio: "effettivamente avevamo pochissime forze. Allora era naturale e legittima la determinazione di buttarsi interamente nel lavoro tra gli operai e biasimare seriamente ogni allontanamento da esso, allora l'unico scopo era quello di rafforzarsi nella classe operaia".
 </p>
<p>
  Anche qui, però, il problema è: con quale concezione, con quale prassi, con quale propaganda e agitazione ci si butta interamente tra gli operai e ci si rafforza nella classe operaia? Con la politica sindacale, tradunionista, con il suo sviluppo economista, o con la politica comunista, sia pure agli inizi del processo di radicamento e organizzazione per la costruzione del Partito? Con l'idea che nella classe operaia questo lavoro non si può fare, che viene dopo che abbiamo condotto l'attività sindacale e conseguentemente allo sviluppo di essa, o con la propaganda e agitazione, sia pure nelle condizioni molto difficili che ci sono oggi nelle fila della classe operaia?
 </p>
<p>
  Anche qui Lenin è molto preciso: "Il pubblico ideale per le denunce politiche è proprio la classe operaia, che ha bisogno prima di tutto e soprattutto di una conoscenza politica viva e completa e che è la più atta a trasformare queste conoscenze in lotta attiva, anche se questa non promette alcun "risultato tangibile".
 </p>
<p>
  D'altra parte questa è l'unica strada che ha la classe operaia per diventare punto di riferimento della lotta e dell'opposizione di tutti gli strati della società. Ed è questo il ruolo crescente che la classe operaia, prima con le sole avanguardie poi con la lotta attiva, può permettere a noi di "diventare una forza politica agli occhi degli altri". E per diventare questo "bisogna lavorare molto e con tenacia per elevare la nostra coscienza, il nostro spirito di iniziativa e la nostra energia". E - insiste Lenin - "non è sufficiente attaccare l'etichetta di avanguardia su una teoria e una pratica di retroguardia".

  El movimiento popular madrileño consiguió evitar el desalojo del CPK (Centro Político Kolectivizado) La Bankarrota, que estaba programado el día de ayer miércoles 20 de marzo. El desalojo estaba programado a las 08:00h y estaba prevista la presencia de la UIP (Unidad de Intervención Policial), los antidisturbios. El fondo buitre “Arguijo” quería expulsar del espacio a las masas que se organizaron para conquistarlo, que ya en su día se lo arrebataron a la entidad financiera Caja Madrid. Pero la policía, fiel perro de presa del capital financiero (plasmado esta vez en el fondo buitre “Arguijo”), no puedo desalojar el centro.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2ad6116eaf4ec54313d7997f5f53a403">
  La presencia de las masas fue mayor y mejor organizada de lo que podía pensar las fuerzas de represión del Estado. Viendo que no había presencia policial suficiente para ejecutar el desalojo, los responsables del desahucio enviaron a la comisión judicial para retrasarlo y marcar una nueva fecha (aún sin agendar, que sepamos, a día de hoy). De esta manera fue evitado el desalojo: con la organización y movilización de las masas, que desde antes de las 08:00h, se presentaron en los alrededores dispuestos a poner su cuerpo ante las unidades de antidisturbios. Aunque esta victoria es temporal y el capital financiero intentará de nuevo arrebatar el edificio, estamos seguros que el movimiento popular defenderá, una vez más, estos espacios físicos de organización política de la clase obrera.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-81220136960a497065038e35b73e5ac8">
  El CPK La Bankarrota ha sido un centro físico de organización política de las masas, especialmente las del barrio de Moratalaz, que es donde se ubica (Calle Encomienda de Palacios, número 46). En el llamado a defender el centro social, el propio CPK escribía: “
  <em>
   Durante los últimos 9 años, La Bankarrota ha servido de espacio de reunión para múltiples colectivos de Moratalaz y Madrid. Desde aquí se han parado desahucios, se han podido recaudar fondos para gastos represivos, se han realizado charlas y debates muy interesantes, ha servido de refugio político para multitud de organizaciones
  </em>
  ”.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-206adddb063cdc5b8154877ba09e83cf">
  La defensa del CPK La Bankarrota es un soplo de aire fresco en un mes de intenso calor. El 13 de marzo fue desalojada el CSO La Ferroviaria (también en Madrid) y el CSO L’Obrera (Sabadell). Un día después, el 14, el CSO Loira (Zaragoza). De hecho, esta concatenación de actos represivos es tal que buena parte del movimiento popular considera que este mes de marzo ha empezado una “
  <em>
   guerra contra los centros sociales”.
  </em>
  Esta guerra será larga, con desalojos que se ganen y otros que se pierdan, pero la lucha debe seguir hasta que haya
  <em>
   ¡Diez, cien, mil centros sociales!
  </em>
  [consigna que fue escuchada en la movilización que evitó el desalojo].
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c6a0d153e5222992405a41c5994f5ccb">
  El autor de este artículo considera que esta
  <em>
   guerra
  </em>
  se enmarca dentro del proceso crisis y descomposición del imperialismo, y de militarización de los estados. En este caso concreto, la ofensiva contra los centros sociales queda dentro de la lógica del proceso de militarización del Estado español. Más aún teniendo en cuenta la importancia máxima del sector de la vivienda en nuestro país, donde el capital financiero es particularmente más agresivo que en otros sectores de la economía. Basta recordar que el capital financiero se salta toda la legalidad burguesa cuando lo requiere. El mejor ejemplo es que sus tropas de choque más reaccionarias (empresas de desokupación) son pseudo-paramilitares ilegales abiertamente fascistas.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6e1d2961a81fee07dbe72905d10afef0">
  Estaremos alerta hasta conocer cuál es la próxima de desalojo.

<a href="https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/landespolitik/kommentar-debatte-um-ogs-100.html">
   Die grün-schwarze Landesregierung von CDU und den Grünen hat den Eltern und Kindern in Nordrhein-Westfalen eine bessere Ganztagsversorgung an Grundschulen versprochen.
  </a>
  Geplant war von Seiten der Landesregierung ein Gesetz, welches einen gesicherten Anspruch auf ganztägliche Betreuung in Schulen gewährleistet. Dieses Gesetz würde nicht nur Eltern und gerade Mütter entlasten und ihnen ermöglichen Lohnarbeit und Kindererziehung besser in Einklang zu bringen oder im stressigen Alltag etwas mehr Freizeit zu haben, sondern würde auch den Kindern eine bessere schulische und außerschulische Förderung garantieren. Und auch Allgemein würde das Gesetz einen positiven Beitrag zum sonst immer mehr überlasteten Schulsystem leisten.
 </p>
<p>
  Geplant war das Landesgesetz ursprünglich als notwendige Ergänzung und Komplement zum im Jahr 2021 beschlossenen Bundesgesetz, dass einen Rechtsanspruch auf eine Ganztagsbetreuung in Grundschulen formuliert. Implementiert würde das Gesetz ab dem Schuljahr 2026/27 mit der Einschulung der Erstklässler und würde dann schrittweise bis zum Jahr 2029/30 bis zur vierten Klasse eingeführt werden. Das Gesetz in NRW sollte dann regeln, wie die Ganztagsbetreeung durch wen umgesetzt werden soll, und welche inhaltlichen und betreuerischen Standards bei der Besetzung der Stellen berücksichtigt werden müssen.
 </p>
<p>
  Stattdessen bricht die Landesregierung ihr Versprechen gegenüber den Eltern und Kindern im Land und beschränkt sich lediglich auf sogenannte „Leitlinien“, die nichts anderes als den Rechtsanspruch des Bundesgesetzes reproduzieren und den Status-Quo wiederkäuen.  Ein Ganztagsplatz wird acht Stunden pro Schultag umfassen. Wie das umgesetzt wird und wer für die Betreuung verantwortlich sein wird, soll laut Landesschulministerin Dorothee Feller vor Ort entschieden werden.
 </p>
<p>
  In der Praxis heißt das; Kommunen und Schulen werden allein gelassen und müssen sich darum sorgen im deutschen Bürokratiedschungel  entweder in Kooperation mit externen Trägern der Jugendhilfe oder aus eigener Kraft und staatlicher Finanzierung ein Ganztagsangebot über acht Stunden anzubieten. Da sowieso schon im Bildungs- und Sozialbereich ein großer Personalmangel besteht und die Schulen untereinander um Fördergelder und Personal konkurrieren wird das – gerade in Zeiten von einer Krisenpolitik, die am Sozialhaushalt kürzt wo es geht – zu einem pädagogisch-organisatorischen Flickenteppich führen. Verschiedene Träger der Jugendhilfe werden qualitativ schwankende Angebote anbieten und das mit unterqualifizierten Personal, weil die Mindestqualifikation nicht gesetzlich geregelt wurde. Das Endergebnis ist, dass die Ganztagsbetreuung eher einer Kinderaufbewahrung ähnelt, wie es in zahlreichen Kitas der Fall ist und keine pädagogisch reichhaltige Förderung sein wird. Dazu kommt, dass es auch keine Regelungen gibt wie groß die zu betreuenden Gruppen mindestens und maximal sein dürfen, was dazu führen sollte, dass nicht jedes Kind, das einen Anspruch auf einen Ganztagsplatz hat, auch einen bekommen wird, weil unklar ist, ob das Land es innerhalb von zwei Jahren schafft den Bedarf für alle Grundschulkinder decken zu können.
 </p>
<p>
  Die Frage warum die Landesregierung es nicht geschafft hat nach drei Jahren ein Gesetz zu verabschieden dürfte finanzieller Natur sein. Das sehen auch die anderen Fraktionen im Parlament so. In den letzten Tagen gingen über tausend Schüler in NRW auf die Straße, um für mehr Lehrer, eine bessere Bildung und Teilhabe zu demonstrieren. Dort hörte man öfter die Parole „Für die Rüstung sind sie fix, für die Bildung tun sie nix!“ und das stimmt genau. Für die Aufrüstung des deutschen Imperialismus und die Entwicklung der deutschen Monopole ist Geld da. Für Gesundheit, Soziales und Bildung machen sie nichts.  Die Kinder werden von der Kita bis zum Ende ihrer Schullaufbahn von Aufbewahrung zu Aufbewahrung weitergereicht und die Eltern werden im Stich gelassen. Ausbaden werden das wieder größtenteils die Mütter, die aufgrund der patriarchalen Unterdrückung dazu verdonnert werden das Mehr an Kinderbetreuung zu leisten, welches der bürgerliche Staat an sie weitergibt. Ein weiterer guter Grund wegen dem die Schüler, Eltern und Lehrer zusammen auf die Straße gehen sollten.

  On the 8

   th
  </sup>
  of March a combative and anti-imperialist contingent took part to the demonstration organized by Fosse aux Lyons and CFP. This contingent expressed their support to the heroic Palestinian national resistance and especially the women of Gaza. The protesters carried a banner with the slogans “Support for our sisters in Gaza who fight against imperialism and patriarchy! Palestine will win!” and shouted slogans in support of armed struggle, against Zionism and imperialism. Several speeches took a stance against US imperialism and Zionism, and also French imperialism and its treatment of the Mahorese women was condemned. Nouvelle Epoque reports that the contingent was well received among the masses.

   session
  </a>
  celebrating the 8

   th
  </sup>
  of March. The panel was attended by women representatives of the League of Poor Peasants of the Northeast (LCP-NE), a representative of the Committee for the Defense of the Agrarian Revolution (CDRA) of the José Ricardo Revolutionary Area and a teacher from the Elizabete Teixeira People’s School. During the event, a daycare service was organized in order to allow peasant mothers to take part. Following the Internationale, the principles of the People’s Women’s Movement were presented and there was reading and discussion about the origin of the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, a part of the MFP bulletin. At the end, it was discussed and defined how women could increase their participation in the struggle to recover water sources and land from the old Frei Caneca plantation. In this way, the plenary session led the formation of an agitation and propaganda committee to recover water sources and organize a daycare service so that women can actively participate in recovering the land. The session ended with the Anthem of the Revolutionary Fighters and many slogans from the warriors of the southern forest of Pernambuco.

  As we reported earlier, a massive and combative demonstration

   took place

  on the 8

  <strong>
   Colombia
  </strong>
  . The struggle of the women who took part
  <a href="https://nuevademocracia.com.co/?p=26117">
   has been criminalized
  </a>
  by members of the ruling classes, with posters published accusing some of the women of vandalism, as well as intimidation and detention carried out by the police against women for such reasons as wearing green or purple scarves. Now women’s organizations are denouncing that the old State is quick to repress the protest of women but don’t punish the murderers and rapists of women. Posters have been put up and slogans have been painted by revolutionary women condemning the criminalization of protest.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.  Article 10 Nothing in this Part shall be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of  international law for purposes other than this Statute.  Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2. The Court may exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes of aggression committed one year after the  ratification or acceptance of the amendments by thirty States Parties. 3. The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with this article, subject  to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the  adoption of an amendment to the Statute. 5 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>10 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court4. The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10.

A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 5.

Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

(a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5.

The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged.

At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7.

After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11.

The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations.

The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

(a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part. Article 89   Surrender of persons to the Court 1. The Court may transmit a request for the arrest and surrender of a person, together with the material  supporting the request outlined in article 91, to any State on the territory of which that person may be  found and shall request the cooperation of that State in the arrest and surrender of such a person. States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2.

The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party.

Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2.

Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2.

A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3.

Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2.

Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

<p>
  When Luiz Inácio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on.
 </p>
<p>
  While investigations prove that a considerable part of the High Command of the Armed Forces and senior officials, even in minority, mobilized to consummate the military coup, president Luiz Inácio reiterated his guidance: not to promote acts or events condemning the 60th anniversary of the coup of 1964.
 </p>
<p>
  To prove the error of this government policy, it would be enough to mention how the reactionary sectors of the ruling classes received it. Representing the military right, the ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mourão had no doubts: “He’s right, that’s the past,” he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.
 </p>
<p>
  Estadão [newspaper], used to criticizing Luiz Inácio, was quick to defend him: “Lula acts correctly” by refusing to talk about the 1964 coup in its 60 years, in line with “an imperative of governability in a context of wounds waiting to heal” and “it is also a way of honoring the current military command, also architect of pacification”, he stated in the editorial “Lula’s accommodation with the military” (March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estadão, which has already advocated for the government to reopen the Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances (CEMDP), something that Luiz Inácio refuses to do, capitulates by echoing this government’s cowardly complicity.
 </p>
<p>
  Only the reactionary ideologues – committed above all to the continued exploitation of the people and the Nation – and the opportunists, whose mentality has been emasculated by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of the popular masses, believe that appeasement will lead to the stabilization of the country.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not true that remembering 1964 is inappropriate. The episodes of the serious military crisis of 2022 and the 1964 coup are not wounds waiting to heal: on the other hand they are open, infected wounds, and therefore cannot heal without first undergoing painful removal of the rotted. All appeasers forget that, behind the “green chickens” prosecuted and condemned on January 8, was the High Command of the Armed Forces, especially the Army, which since 2016 began to intervene directly in national political life and state institutions, through psychological warfare operations, such as blackmail, threats and coercion against their leaders. They forget that it was this same High Command that, through speeches of the senior officers, mobilized and incited this reactionary anti-communist public opinion in its base instincts and that had started to agitate the slogan of “Military Intervention”, before Bolsonaro had the relevance he gained. They ignore that, long before Bolsonaro, it was the High Command, through active generals – the then commander of the Army, General Villas Bôas and the former military commander of the South, General Mourão –, which put institutional rupture on the agenda in the event of of “serious institutional crisis” and “social chaos” and placed the Armed Forces to act daily as a reactionary political force contrary to democratic freedoms in parliamentary, judicial and electoral discussions – which is already an intervention, as the Armed Forces impose themselves through weapons, even though their tanks only paraded along the Esplanada dos Ministérios as passing through for training in the interior of Goiás.
 </p>
<p>
  Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the results of the elections (2018) by taking away Luiz Inácio from the race, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote on that candidate in the Supreme Court.
 </p>
<p>
  As we see: long before Bolsonaro took the presidency – and independently of him – the latent wound of the coup was again manifesting itself acutely, especially because it had not been properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with the gorillas and transition with the Amnesty military regime of General and Unrestricted Amnesty, led in which there was no punishment, no change in the high military officials, nor in the training curriculums, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which they followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as “democratic revolution”, and when it was removed from the front of management of the old State, it took back the belief that the Armed Forces were the Moderating Power and guarantors of the “Democratic State of Law” – and, therefore, also guarantors of its restriction or even suspension, as Bolsonaro shamelessly tried to do.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also stupid to believe, as the Estadão editorial suggests, that “the current military command” is “an architect of pacification” and, therefore, trustworthy. The pacification that these gentlemen propose is due to the fact that they find themselves in a situation of great demoralization, due to their identification with all the evil seeds of Bolsonaro’s genocidal military government of which they were part. But it doesn’t hurt to remember that the current commander of the Army, General Tomás Ribeiro Paiva, and the former commander Freire Gomes, both seen as noble democratic figures, although they did not agree with the institutional rupture at that time and publicly declared themselves as, were in the High Command throughout this period in which the Armed Forces resumed their military intervention, now through institutional channels. They, too, are irreducible in the belief that it is the role of the Armed Forces to be moderators: their difference from the Bolsonarists is that, for the former, the Armed Forces must moderate in order to prevent their division, which historical experience proves that in the face of the eminence of such a situation, their cohesion is assured by taking a position on the extreme right, or even more so, if they have the order or agreement of Uncle Sam to do so. In the current case, it was mainly this last determinant that prevailed: the Yankees vetoed and the rupture did not took place.
 </p>
<p>
  When Luiz Inácio chooses the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all favorable conditions to be reestablished for the military High Command to return to the offensive later on. When the masses rise up in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, the gorillas, as the Moderating Power they believe in, will rise again threatening the Country with military intervention to save the Nation from “disintegration”. Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and weakened, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup escalation.
 </p>
<p>
  Appeasement with the military leadership only feeds the coup!
 </p>
<p>
  For genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, as well as the popular masses in struggle, there is no other path left than to forcefully raise the campaign to denounce the 60 years of the ignominious coup of 1964 and the coup, whether in the form of institutional rupture or in the form of “Moderating Power”. Compromises with fascists and coup plotters are not acceptable – which would only lead us to coup and fascism.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2.

The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

(b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1.

Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.

(a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1.

Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6.

This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

(a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4.

If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.

In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

(b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part. Article 89   Surrender of persons to the Court 1. The Court may transmit a request for the arrest and surrender of a person, together with the material  supporting the request outlined in article 91, to any State on the territory of which that person may be  found and shall request the cooperation of that State in the arrest and surrender of such a person. States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.  (b) A request by the Court for transit shall be transmitted in accordance with article 87.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.  Article 91   Contents of request for arrest and surrender 1. A request for arrest and surrender shall be made in writing.

In the case of a request for the arrest and surrender of a person already convicted, the request shall contain  or be supported by:  (a) A copy of any warrant of arrest for that person;  (b) A copy of the judgement of conviction;  (c) Information to demonstrate that the person sought is the one referred to in the judgement of  conviction; and  (d) If the person sought has been sentenced, a copy of the sentence imposed and, in the case of a  sentence for imprisonment, a statement of any time already served and the time remaining to be  served. 4.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

Where execution of a particular measure of assistance detailed in a request presented under paragraph  1, is prohibited in the requested State on the basis of an existing fundamental legal principle of general  application, the requested State shall promptly consult with the Court to try to resolve the matter. In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.  (b) Where, however, the request from the Court concerns information, property or persons which are  subject to the control of a third State or an international organization by virtue of an international  agreement, the requested States shall so inform the Court and the Court shall direct its request to the  third State or international organization.  10.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2.

Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

<p>
  The President of the Generality, Pere Aragonès, announced last Wednesday, March 13, that the regional elections were expedited to May 12. What should be the opinion of the revolutionaries on this matter? With this opinion article we aim to clarify some fundamental questions.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   The parties of the Catalan bourgeoisie have betrayed the Catalan proletariat and people again and again
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The torrent of mobilization and fury of the Catalan national liberation movement, whose qualitative leap we saw on October 1, 2017 with the holding of the referendum declared illegal by the Spanish State – and its subsequent repression – has led to nothing. We must learn a lesson from what happened.
 </p>
<p>
  The Catalan bourgeois politicians have betrayed the Catalan people over and over and again. They have governed in the same way as the political representatives of the Spanish imperialist bourgeoisie. The policy of the Generality of Catalonia (Junts, ERC, and PSC, including the CUP) regarding the increase in the CPI [Translator’s note: Consumer Price Index] and the gains has been the same: none. The policy regarding the housing issue has been the same: allow the gentrification of urban centers, allow the abusive increase in rents, evict the poorest families and vacate social centers. The health policy has been the same: privatization and cutting resources. The democratic rights policy has been the same: repress mobilizations and attack/torture political prisoners. The educational policy has been the same: allow the advancement of concerted and private education, cut resources and attack teachers’ labor rights. With one hand they falsely championed the right to an education in Catalan while with the other they attacked education. The international policy with the State of Israel has been the same: constant denial of the right to exist and defend Palestine. Immigration policy has been the same… even worse! The abuses of the Barcelona Urban Police and the Mossos d’Esquadra throughout Catalonia are notable. And a long etcetera in all the specific government policies.
 </p>
<p>
  “Thank goodness ours govern and not the PP and Vox” they say in the TV3 gatherings. The reality is that ERC, Junts and PSC govern exactly the same as PSOE, PP and Vox. The Catalan bourgeois politicians are class enemies of the proletariat and enemies of the people. They seek independence only for their economic interests, they do not hesitate to crush the proletariat and they absolutely do not care about the Catalan language and culture.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   The national liberation movement at the crossroads:
  </strong>
<br>
<strong>
   follow the bourgeois path or the proletarian path?
  </strong>
</br></h2>
<p>
  There are two paths in the Catalan national liberation movement: the bourgeois path and the proletarian path. The two paths are completely different in class interests, method and objectives.
 </p>
<p>
  The bourgeois path serves the Catalan bourgeoisie, which seeks the independence of Catalonia from the Spanish State to become imperialist itself, continue oppressing its own people and take the leap to oppress other peoples in the world. The bourgeois path keeps the proletariat and the people in poverty, as it has done for centuries. Increase in prices and increase in the CPI, labor exploitation, increase in rents, evictions and police violence, etc. The Catalan bourgeois politicians in Barcelona have governed in the same way as the Spanish bourgeois politicians in Madrid. The bourgeois path urges the masses to participate in the electoral farce, seeking to extinguish the people’s desire for democratic rights and freedoms and spreads racism and chauvinism against the people (both the Spanish people and the oppressed nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia).
 </p>
<p>
  The proletarian path serves the proletariat and other democratic layers that make up the Catalan people (democratic petty bourgeoisie, small peasants, artisans and semi-proletarians, etc.), defends the right of self-determination and separation of nations tooth and nail, and fiercely combats the attacks of Spanish chauvinism against the Catalan language and culture. The proletarian path seeks the emancipation of the proletariat, destroying the oppressive bourgeois State – be it the Spanish one or a hypothetical Catalan State – to build socialism, to build the proletarian State. The proletarian path calls for proletarian internationalism and the common struggle of the proletariat of the nations of the Spanish State (Spain, Catalonia, Basque, Galicia) to struggle against the same enemy, the Spanish imperialist State, with the perspective of a federated Socialist Republic of nations and peoples inspired by the great and heroic Soviet Union. If the bourgeois path calls to participate in elections and legitimize the bourgeois State, the proletarian path calls to discard false parliamentary illusions and prepare for the present combats and those to come.
 </p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Boycott the electoral farce!
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  During the last few years, revisionists and opportunists of all kinds have called on the masses to participate in the electoral farce, to voice their political demands in parliament and to continue down the bourgeois path. The bourgeois path only serves the bourgeoisie. You cannot change the bourgeois State from within, you cannot change a machine of oppression from within. Much less can independence be achieved by participating within the institutions of the Spanish State (Generality, Provincial Councils, City Councils, …) and being part of it.
 </p>
<p>
  In an article published in Servir al Pueblo, it was explained, in a summarized way, why to apply the boycott. We reproduce it in full:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   1. Why to boycott the elections?
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   – Because we chose the revolutionary path and socialism, the power of the working class against the bourgeoisie. The participation in the elections, directly or not directly, has nothing to do with the path to the socialism (proletarian revolution).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   – Because the elections inside the Bourgeois State are a farce. This is the reason that we call them electoral farce or electoral farce of the bourgeoisie. There are not a farce because are rigged, but because don’t matter what you are gonna vote: there is no any democracy. All the really important decisions, absolutely all of them, are being decided in other ways and not in the parliamentary one.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   – Because with the elections we chose the government, but not the State or the ruling class. The turn government is just the administrator of the interests of the financial oligarchy, the imperialist bourgeoisie, which is the ruler of the Spanish State. There is no substantial difference between all the governments of the Bourgeois democracy in the recent history (approximately, since 1975).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   2. Why to vote is useless to stop fascism?
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   – Because the recent fascistization of the State (more presence on the streets and in the mass media of fascist parties/organizations, more influence of reactionary ideas, etc…) is the logic consequence of the militarization of the Spanish State. Since 1980, as approximate date, the States began to militarize themselves. Inside the plan of militarization of the Spanish State, the fascistization is a consequence of this. Therefore, a bigger presence of the fascism is not because of a electoral success. Is quite the opposite: the electoral success of reactionary forces and fascists is because of the fascism and the reaction being more present in the society, consequence of this militarization and fascistization of the States (and, in this case, of the Spanish State).
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   – There will be not more or less repression to the working class movement depending on the turn government, or at least, because of the decision of the party in the government. In other words, the bigger or smaller repression is because of the plans of the financial oligarchy, and not because of the plans of the bourgeois leader of turn. During the last years of progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, we have suffered repression in the general strike of the metal in Cadiz and Vigo; the imprisonment of the political prisoner Pablo Hasel; there have not repeal the “Ley Mordaza” [Translator’s note: the main repressive law in Spanish State, which the social-democrats promised to repeal]; they have been committed the genocide against the African masses in Melilla; they have committed thousands and thousands of evictions; they have infiltrated national policemen inside the social and political movements, etc.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   3. Why is useless to vote the less bad option?
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   – Because the less bad option is not any option. Vote to PP, PSOE, Vox or Sumar doesn’t change anything, all of them are administrators of the financial capital. None of the parties of the parliament challenge nor the bourgeois order, neither the Spanish imperialist. During the last years of the progressive government of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, the life conditions of the working class became worst in all the aspects. We are gonna reward the administrators of the financial capital voting them again with the excuse of “stop the fascism” to allow them to worsen our life in the next years?
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   –
  </em>
<em>
   Because vote the less bad option doesn’t protect civil, social or trade-unionist rights. Which rights we have recovered with the progresist government of coalitin between PSOE and Unidas Podemos? They have break up the union movement and have repressed the movements of the combative masses. The prices are increasing much more than wages. The alleged winning of rights for the proletarian woman and the LGTB collective is a ghost in a paper, meanwhile the hate crimes non stop their increase. What have done the government for the proletariat?”
  </em>
</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   The Catalan proletariat must
  </strong>
<strong>
   struggle
  </strong>
<strong>
   side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat
  </strong>
</h2>
<p>
  The Catalan proletariat will be completely free not only when its national rights are respected, but when it is liberated as a social class. And that involves the destruction of the Spanish imperialist State, the old bourgeois State, and the generation of a new power, the new proletarian State. The Catalan proletariat cannot fight alone against the Spanish imperialist State. It must fight side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat as class brothers against the common enemy: the Spanish State, Spanish imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  This titanic task involves the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Spain as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, mainly Maoist, Party with the universally valid contributions of Chairman Gonzalo. A militarized Party prepared to take political power with People’s War and with the perspective of shaping the dictatorship of the proletariat as a federal Socialist Republic where the proletariat of all nations struggle, as class brothers and ultimately, until communism.
 </p>
<p>
  Thus, and only thus, the Catalan proletariat will be free. And the first step cannot be other than delegitimate the electoral farce, discard illusions in bourgeois democracy and preparing for the battles that will come in the struggle against the Spanish State.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.

This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

(a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2. As an exception to the principle of public hearings provided for in article 67, the Chambers of the Court  may, to protect victims and witnesses or an accused, conduct any part of the proceedings in camera or  allow the presentation of evidence by electronic or other special means.

Such measures shall be exercised in a manner which is not prejudicial to or  inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial.  6. A State may make an application for necessary measures to be taken in respect of the protection of its  servants or agents and the protection of confidential or sensitive information.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6.

The procedures governing the imposition of the measures set forth in paragraph 1 shall be those provided  for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Article 72   Protection of national security information 1. This article applies in any case where the disclosure of the information or documents of a State would, in  the opinion of that State, prejudice its national security interests. Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3.

(a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4.

Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2.

The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  Representantes das famílias camponesas que ocuparam recentemente a fazenda Ipê, em Machadinho D’Oeste, região nordeste de Rondônia, denunciaram um ataque brutal ao acampamento, promovido por um bando de paramilitares e policiais, no dia 07 de março de 2024.
 </p>
<p>
  Os acampados foram surpreendidos por vários homens sem farda que invadiram o acampamento pela mata. O bando paramilitar algemou, espancou os trabalhadores e os entregou a policiais que estavam esperando numa área de soja, com várias viaturas e até um helicóptero. Os camponeses pensaram que seriam encarcerados, mas sofreram nova sessão de agressão física, dessa vez pelos policiais; apenas um acampado foi levado preso.
 </p>
<p>
  O helicóptero, provavelmente era o mesmo que atuou na região de Machadinho, desde o dia 05/03, era vinculado à Polícia Federal, como é possível ver no vídeo:
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-video">
<video controls="" src="https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MACHADINHO-VID-20240306-WA0204.mp4">
</video>
</figure>
<p>
  Os representantes dos camponeses suspeitam que um dos mandantes desse crime seja o latifundiário “Ivo da Ipê”, que se diz o dono da fazenda Ipê – terras públicas destinada à reforma agrária – grilada por seu sogro, Sijuca, já falecido, proprietário da Madeireira Ipê, em Jaru.
 </p>
<p>
  “Ivo do Ipê” é um antigo inimigo dos camponeses, responsável pelo assassinato do camponês Ivo Martins, da Área Cristo Rei, em Cacaulândia, segundo denúncias feitas por lideranças da luta pela terra ao Ministério do Desenvolvimento Agrário, em fevereiro de 2003. Camponeses também o responsabilizam pelos assassinatos covardes dos companheiros Tonha e Serafim, no dia 01 de agosto de 2003. Eles eram lideranças de vários acampamentos na região de Machadinho e foram vítimas de uma emboscada, quando voltavam de uma reunião no Incrade Ariquemes, marcada de emergência pelo órgão federal.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  Novo caso de repressão à justa luta pela terra
 </h3>
<p>
  Este novo ataque a camponeses, no início de março, se soma a vários outros na região, promovidos por um consórcio de latifundiários da extrema direita que tem atuado com grupos paramilitares em conjunto com as tropas oficiais do velho Estado.
 </p>
<p>
  No dia 28 de fevereiro, um helicóptero da polícia tinha sobrevoado várias áreas de luta pela terra em Machadinho. Camponeses de ao menos 3 localidades relataram o sobrevoo desta aeronave, que saiu cedo do município e só retornou pra base no final da tarde. Lideranças camponesas da região temem que isso seja parte de algum planejamento conjunto entre latifundiários e polícias para uma onda de repressão a camponeses em luta pelo direito a terra.
 </p>
<p>
  Na semana passada, camponeses da área Paredão, na rodovia RO-257, também em Machadinho, se reuniram para preparar a resistência contra nova ordem de despejo, expedida injustamente pelo judiciário. Terra pública, tem uma ordem da justiça federal para retirar o fazendeiro, desde 2012 – para isso nunca vieram, para retirar os camponeses, já despejaram cerca de 3 vezes.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
  ‘Não sairemos de nossas terras!’
 </h3>
<p>
  Por outro lado, os camponeses organizados reafirmam sua decisão de resistir em suas terras e se preparam, cada vez de forma mais unida, organizada e combativa.

    Esos tigres de papel les apetece irrumpir en Ecuador, pues,
los derechos laborales son vulnerados y así saciarse del trabajo ajeno. Entonces,
las mineras tienen garantizada la mano de obra barata con relaciones de
producción semifeudales. El gobierno burgués/terrateniente de Noboa, va más
allá de ser un representante de la facción gran burguesa compradora, es la
encarnación del feudalismo, un terrateniente criado a imagen y semejanza de los
yanquis para reproducir la feudalidad, el gamonalismo, la servidumbre, el
trabajo no pago y la semicolonialidad.

frente unos cuantos pobladores despistados y traidores, bajo el pretexto de una
supuesta socialización del proyecto minero, con ese mecanismo ingresan al

   Ang Bayan

<p>
<strong>
   March 21, 2024
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The Filipino people are burning with rage at the US-Marcos regime over its all-out fascist oppression throughout the country, especially in the countryside. The peasant masses are outraged that amidst widespread misery and hunger, the reactionary regime is intent on fascism and land grabbing.
 </p>
<p>
  Desperate to “finish off” the revolutionary armed resistance of the Filipino people, the US-Marcos regime’s armed tentacles is carrying out a rampant terrorist and fascist rampage throughout the country. Marcos and the AFP are set to make one false declaration after another that provinces have become “insurgency-free,” especially in areas that have long been targets of foreign corporations for mining, plantation and energy projects. At the behest of US imperialism, the AFP is also in a hurry to “end” the armed struggle of the Filipino people so that the US military can fully employ the AFP in its war of provocation against China which is likely to intensify in the coming year.
 </p>
<p>
  Marcos and the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) have recently ordered an all-out war. The declared aim of this war is to dismantle all NPA guerrilla fronts by the end of March, destroy all NPA combat units by the end of June, and destroy all regional Party committees before the end of the year. Thousands of military troops, alongside police combat troops and tens of thousands of paramilitaries armed by the AFP, have been dispatched to ravage the countryside.
 </p>
<p>
  Hundreds of villages are being garrisoned by Marcos’ fascist minions. Oppressive soldiers are controlling people’s lives and livelihoods, silencing them and trampling on their rights and freedoms. Checkpoints and food blockades, prohibiting people from working in their fields or swidden farms, armed soldiers occupying barangay centers, going house to house and forcing people to “surrender,” harassing young women or even married women, all-night drinking, beatings and altercations, indiscriminate firing of guns—this is how people perceive the rotten soldiers. Amid drought and disasters, fascist soldiers are like pests who bring nothing but disaster to their communities.
 </p>
<p>
  Using powerful weapons such as drones and jet fighters, helicopters and howitzers, Marcos’s terrorist soldiers are bombing mountains and fields, indiscriminately firing night or day, destroying the forests and poisoning waters, shattering the peace and causing deep trauma to the people, especially children, pregnant women and the elderly. These result in unnecessary number of lives lost, contrary to all principles and laws of civilized warfare.
 </p>
<p>
  The evil aim of Marcos is to instill fear in the hearts of the people and force them prostrate while allowing their land to be grabbed by big foreign capitalists and their partner comprador bourgeoisie and big landlords. But instead of falling on the ground, the people are more and more roused to stand up and fight, and tread the path of armed revolution.
 </p>
<p>
  In the guerrilla fronts across the country, the units of the New People’s Army (NPA) continue to enjoy deep and widespread support from the peasant masses. Military officers of the AFP and the reactionary state are furious that despite their intensified all-out war which has lasted for almost seven years, the peasant masses continue to provide political and material support to the Red fighters. Young farmers, as well as young students, workers, as well as professionals continue to join the people’s army.
 </p>
<p>
  The people’s desire to carry forward the armed struggle continues to burn. Amid fascist attacks perpetrated by the armed minions of the US-Marcos regime, and oppressive policies that worsen their plight, it is becoming clearer to the minds and consciousness of the peasant masses that they completely have nothing if they do not have the New People’s Army on their side to defend their lives and rights, and to fight with for their land and livelihood.
 </p>
<p>
  In recent years, the NPA has suffered losses and setbacks in various parts of the country due to the errors and weaknesses of conservatism and complacency with its previous accomplishments. Instead of boldly treading the path of continuous expansion and invigoration of the armed struggle, the scope and mass base of guerrilla units were reduced, and units became passive and vulnerable to enemy encirclement. Under the guidance of and inspired by the Party, the NPA is determined to rectify errors and move forward on the path of strengthening and galvanizing the people’s war.
 </p>
<p>
  In the spirit of the rectification movement, the NPA must more vigorously wage armed struggle in all parts of the country. Utilizing the broad mass movement in guerrilla warfare, they must use all weapons—guns and rocks, spears and punji traps, shotguns and landmines—and carry out large or small tactical offensives that can be won against weak and isolated parts of the enemy. Strike at the enemy’s fascist troops and all its tentacles by way of rendering justice for the people and inspiring their resistance. Only by waging widespread armed resistance can the NPA consolidate, overcome setbacks and strengthen.
 </p>
<p>
  Since its establishment, five and a half decades ago, the NPA has served as the true people’s army in promoting the revolutionary aspirations of the Filipino people for national democracy. On its coming anniversary on March 29, let us celebrate its accomplishments for the past 55 years, pay tribute to all the martyrs and heroes, and reaffirm the determination to advance the protracted people’s war, without fear of sacrifices and hardships, to achieve ultimate victory in the future.

   Bloccato il bando di collaborazione con Israele
  </b>
<p>
   Cosa è successo.
   <b>
    L’ateneo di Torino, primo a livello italiano, ha deciso di sospendere la collaborazione con le realtà accademiche israeliane
   </b>
   .
 «Il Senato dell’Università ritiene non opportuna la partecipazione al 
bando del Ministero degli Affari Esteri (Maeci), visto il protrarsi 
della situazione di guerra a Gaza». La comunicazione si configura come 
una parziale vittoria per i collettivi studenteschi che

    hanno prima bloccato la riunione dei senatori e poi ottenuto un’assemblea pubblica
   </a>
   per discutere la loro richiesta di boicottaggio di tutte le intese con 
le università israeliane. Dopo una lunga discussione, i vertici 
dell’ateneo hanno deciso di
   <b>
    approvare un documento che di fatto chiude le porte ad un unico bando
   </b>
   , quello pubblicato recentemente dal Maeci che mira a finanziare  progetti congiunti di ricerca
   <b>

  </b>
<p>
   Sul caso interviene anche
   <b>
    il ministro dell'Università e della ricerca Anna Maria Bernini
   </b>
   : «Quella
 dell'Università di Torino è una decisione che non condivido seppur 
assunta nell'ambito dell'autonomia propria degli Atenei. È triste che 
una scelta simile coincida con la prima giornata nazionale delle 
Università che ha come titolo: "Porte aperte". Ed è francamente 
sconcertante che si possa pensare di chiuderle. Ritengo ogni forma di 
esclusione o boicottaggio sbagliata ed estranea alla tradizione e alla 
cultura dei nostri Atenei da sempre ispirata all'apertura e 
all'inclusività».

   La nota dell'Università di Torino
  </b>
<p>
   L’Università di Torino, dal canto suo, in una nota, chiarisce che
   <b>
    la mozione approvata dal Senato Accademico
   </b>
   nella seduta di ieri 19 marzo, con la quale «visto il perdurare dello 
stato di guerra si è ritenuta non opportuna la partecipazione al bando 
MAECI 2024 Italia-Israele»,
   <b>
    si riferisce esclusivamente al bando in questione.
   </b>
   Pertanto,
 tutti gli accordi e le collaborazioni in corso con le università 
israeliane rimangono attivi, nel pieno rispetto dei principi e dei 
valori di libertà di pensiero e di ricerca dell’Università di Torino.

   A votare lo stop al bando Maeci per la raccolta di progetti congiunti per l’anno 2024

   . Due gli astenuti e un unico «no», espresso dalla
   <b>
    professoressa Susanna Terracini
   </b>
   . La direttrice del dipartimento di Matematica spiega: «Non avrei avuto problemi ad approvare
   <b>
    una richiesta per il cessate il fuoco

  Su questo, i vertici dell’Università di Torino prendono tempo. Accolta così la proposta di

  </b>
  , di limitare l’azione a un documento che di fatto sospende la partecipazione di
  <b>
   Unito al bando Maeci di quest’anno

  .
 «Ad oggi, solo  tre colleghi avevano manifestato il loro interesse a 
partecipare, tutti appartenenti ad Agraria, ma  poi hanno rinunciato 
autonomamente»,
  <b>
   spiega Gianluca Cuniberti
  </b>
  . Il  direttore di 
Storia che, dopo aver sottolineato la capacità di Unito di dialogare 
anche su temi così divisivi, annuncia un’altra iniziativa che farà 
discutere: tra pochi mesi sarà lanciato
  <b>

  «Gravissimo»
 </b>
<p>
  La decisione del Senato accademico «è
  <b>
   gravissima ed inquietante
  </b>
  e ci riporta ad un passato lontano che non avremmo mai voluto rivivere», dichiara
  <b>
   Stefano Parisi

  , presidente dell'

   Associazione Setteottobre
  </b>
  .
 «Colpire il mondo dell’università e della ricerca di Israele che è 
all’avanguardia nel mondo ed impedire la collaborazione con un ateneo 
importante come quello di Torino, che potrebbe portare ricadute positive
 per il nostro Paese è l’ennesima dimostrazione del clima di odio 
antisemita che dal 7 ottobre sta montando con furia in Italia. Chiediamo
 a tutte le istituzioni ed in particolare al Ministro per l’Università e
 la Ricerca, alla CRUI e alla società civile di impegnarsi e di 
intervenire per bloccare una deriva allarmante e intollerabile per una 
democrazia liberale».

     nasceva la prima grande esperienza di potere

due mesi e dieci giorni, dal 18 marzo al 28 maggio, ma questi due

“Parigi operaia, con la sua Comune, sarà celebrata in eterno, come
l'araldo glorioso di una nuova società. I suoi martiri hanno per
urna il grande cuore della classe operaia. I suoi sterminatori, la

     La
Comune di Parigi per essere sconfitta ci volle un intero esercito,
giorni e giorni di massacri. Ci furono più di 30 mila comunardi
uccisi e tra questi anche tante donne e bambini. Seguirono 45mila
arresti, decine di migliaia di condanne - molte trasformatisi in
uccisioni - e di deportazioni, mentre migliaia di parigini fuggirono
all'estero. In quei giorni ci fu un fiume di sangue che scorreva
nelle strade.

Lenin dice: "Il ricordo dei combattenti della Comune è onorato
non solo dagli operai francesi, ma anche dal proletariato di tutto il
mondo, perché essa non combattè per un obiettivo locale o
strettamente nazionale, ma per l'emancipazione di tutta l'umanità

Il rombo dei cannoni di Parigi ha risvegliato dal loro sonno profondo
gli strati più arretrati del proletariato e ha dato dappertutto un
impulso alla propaganda socialista rivoluzionaria. Per questo la
causa della Comune non è morta, per questo continua a vivere fino ad
oggi in ognuno di noi. La causa della Comune è la causa della

     La
Comune di Parigi viene organizzata in una fase in cui la Francia che
aveva tentato nel 1870 di fare la guerra alla Prussia ne viene
schiacciata. Il popolo cerca di resistere, di rilanciare la battaglia
contro i nemici prussiani, impone la proclamazione della Repubblica,
contando di ottenere riforme sociali e invece trova nel governo,
Thiers - "
     <i>
      questo nano mostruoso

     ", come scrive Marx,
"(che)
     <i>
      mai durante la sua lunga carriera politica, si è
macchiato neppure di un solo provvedimento, sia pure dei più
insignificanti, di qualche utilità pratica. L'unica sua coerenza è
stata l'avidità di ricchezze e l'odio contro coloro che le
producono
     </i>
     " - colui che si inginocchia nei confronti dei
prussiani e vuole disarmare le masse. Una situazione che provocava
per le masse una gravissima condizione in cui mancava tutto e 
che portò alla decisione il 18 marzo di insorgere, cacciare il
governo che aveva firmato una pace disastrosa ed eleggere il 26 marzo
e proclamare il 28 marzo la Comune di Parigi

orsi, le antilopi. Furono introdotte le tessere per la carne, e i più

     L'inverno
1870-1871 fu particolarmente rigido, e per l'alto costo della legna e
del carbone la popolazione smantellò palizzate, segò gli alberi dei
parchi del Bois de Boulogne, di Vincennes, degli Champs-Élysées, di
qualche boulevard, e si rubò legname dai depositi e dalle fabbriche.
L'erogazione del gas interrotta, razionato il petrolio, le strade di
notte erano immerse nel buio più completo. La situazione sanitaria
peggiorò. Prima della guerra la mortalità a Parigi era di 750
decessi a settimana, con l'assedio passò a 1.500 in ottobre e a
4.500 a gennaio”.

suoi membri erano naturalmente operai, o rappresentanti riconosciuti
dalla classe operaia. La Comune doveva essere non un organismo
parlamentare, ma di lavoro, esecutivo e legislativo allo stesso
tempo. Invece di continuare a essere l'agente del governo centrale,
la polizia fu immediatamente spogliata delle sue attribuzioni
politiche e trasformata in strumento responsabile della Comune,
revocabile in qualunque momento. Lo stesso venne fatto per i
funzionari di tutte le altre branche dell'amministrazione. Dai membri
della Comune in giù, il servizio pubblico doveva essere compiuto per
salari da operai. I diritti acquisiti e le indennità di
rappresentanza degli alti dignitari dello stato scomparvero insieme
con i dignitari stessi. Le cariche pubbliche cessarono di essere
proprietà privata delle creature del governo centrale. Non solo

la trasformazione operata dalla Comune di Parigi! Sparita ogni

ritrovo dei grandi proprietari fondiari inglesi, dai latifondisti
assenteisti irlandesi, degli ex negrieri e loschi affaristi
americani, degli ex proprietari di servi russi e dei boiardi
valacchi. Non più cadaveri alla Morgue, non più rapine e scassi
notturni, quasi spariti i furti. Invero, per la prima volta dopo i
giorni del febbraio 1848, le vie di Parigi furono sicure e senza
nessun servizio di polizia. "Non sentiamo più parlare - diceva
un membro della Comune - di assassinii, furti e aggressioni. Si
direbbe davvero che la polizia abbia trascinato con sé a Versailles
tutti i suoi amici conservatori". Le cocottes avevano seguito le
orme dei loro protettori, gli scomparsi campioni della famiglia,
della religione e sopratutto della proprietà. Al posto loro
ricomparvero alla superficie le vere donne di Parigi, eroiche, nobili
e devote come le donne dell'antichità. Parigi lavoratrice,
pensatrice, combattente, insanguinata, raggiante nell'entusiasmo
della sua iniziativa storica, quasi dimentica, nella incubazione di
una nuova società, dei cannibali che erano alle sue porte!

      Il
30 marzo la Comune abolì la coscrizione e l'esercito permanente e
proclamò che la Guardia nazionale, nella quale dovevano arruolarsi
tutti i cittadini atti alle armi, sarebbe stata la sola forza armata.
Essa dichiarò una moratoria di tutte le pigioni per le case di
abitazione dall'ottobre 1870 fino all'aprile, stabilendo che gli
affitti già pagati si dovessero computare in acconto delle pigioni
future; e sospese ogni vendita di oggetti impegnati al Monte di
pietà. Lo stesso giorno gli stranieri eletti a far parte della
Comune furono confermati nella loro carica, perché "la bandiera
della Comune è la bandiera della repubblica mondiale
     </i>
     ".

<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Il
primo aprile venne deciso che lo stipendio più elevato di un
impiegato della Comune, compreso dunque quello dei suoi stessi
membri, non dovesse superare 6.000 franchi.
    </span>

<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Il
giorno seguente (2 aprile) la Comune decretò la separazione della
Chiesa dallo Stato e l'abrogazione di tutti i versamenti dello Stato
a scopi religiosi, come pure la trasformazione di tutti i beni
ecclesiastici in patrimonio nazionale; in seguito a ciò l'8 aprile
fu deciso di dare il bando dalle scuole a tutti i simboli religiosi,
immagini, dogmi, preghiere, insomma a "
     <i>
      tutto ciò che
appartiene al campo della coscienza individuale
     </i>
     ", e la
misura venne a poco a poco applicata. Il giorno 5, in risposta alle
fucilazioni, che si rinnovavano ogni giorno, dei combattenti della
Comune fatti prigionieri dalle truppe di Versailles, fu emanato un
decreto circa l'arresto di ostaggi, ma non venne mai eseguito. Il 6
fu tirata fuori la ghigliottina... e bruciata in pubblico tra alte
grida di giubilo popolare. Il 12 la Comune decise di abbattere la
colonna della vittoria di Piazza Vendôme, fusa dopo la guerra del
1809 con i cannoni presi da Napoleone, ed eretta come simbolo dello
sciovinismo e dell'odio tra i popoli. La cosa venne fatta il 16
maggio. Il 16 aprile la Comune ordinò una statistica delle fabbriche
lasciate inoperose dagli industriali, e la elaborazione di progetti
per l'esercizio di queste fabbriche a mezzo degli operai fino allora
occupati in esse, da riunirsi ora in società cooperative, e per
l'organizzazione di queste società in una grande unione. Il 20 essa
abolì il lavoro notturno dei fornai, come pure la registrazione
degli operai esercitata a partire dal Secondo Impero esclusivamente
per mezzo di soggetti nominati dalla polizia, autentici sfruttatori
degli operai. La registrazione venne affidata ai municipi dei venti
mandamenti di Parigi.

<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Il
30 aprile ordinò l'abolizione delle case di pegno, che non erano se
non uno sfruttamento privato degli operai, in contraddizione col
diritto degli operai ai loro strumenti di lavoro e al credito. Il 5
maggio decretò la demolizione della cappella espiatoria costruita in
ammenda della esecuzione capitale di Luigi XVI."

<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     E
Engels spiega chiaro il carattere proletario del governo della
Comune: "
     <i>
      Come nella Comune vi erano quasi solo operai o
rappresentanti riconosciuti degli operai, così anche le loro
deliberazioni avevano una marcata impronta proletaria
     </i>
     ".

<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Marx,
poi anche Lenin, vede anche le debolezze, i limiti di questa prima
grande esperienza della classe operaia. Marx dice ad un certo punto
che i comunardi erano stati troppo "
     <i>
      magnanimi
     </i>
     ",
quando dovevano perseguire i rappresentanti del governo, dello Stato,
i borghesi che scapparono a Versailles e si riorganizzarono per
tornare a Parigi e massacrare più di 30mila uomini, donne, bambini
“
     <i>
      La Comune fece uso del fuoco esclusivamente come mezzo di
difes
     </i>
     a” - scrive Marx.

<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Uno
stesso generale allora scriveva: “
     <i>
      L'errore più grave fu
probabilmente quello di non attaccare immediatamente Versailles,
errore gravissimo e irreparabile... il Comitato centrale non utilizzò
“tutti i vantaggi inaspettatamente conseguiti. In quel momento
tutte le probabilità erano dalla sua parte. Esso avrebbe dovuto
tentare l'attacco il giorno seguente
     </i>
     ”.

<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
<b>
      Da
questa esperienza che Marx teorizza la necessità della dittatura del
proletariato
     </b>
     . Il proletariato non può solo prendere il potere,
per conservarlo deve esercitare una dittatura verso la borghesia che
ha sconfitto, altrimenti la borghesia si organizza e riprende il suo
potere. E proprio dalle grandi lezioni di questa breve ma intensa
prima esperienza del proletariato che nasce la necessità della
dittatura del proletariato.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Un'altra
lezione importante che Marx ed Engels traggono è il problema dello
Stato.
     <b>
      Lo Stato borghese non basta prenderlo da parte della classe
operaia nelle proprie mani e trasformarlo, ma occorre rovesciarlo e
costruire un nuovo Stato, totalmente diverso, rispetto ai principi,
alla classe che rappresenta. E la Comune cominciò a fare questo.
     </b>
</span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Senza
questa esperienza della Comune di Parigi, non ci sarebbe stata né la
Rivoluzione d'Ottobre e la costruzione del socialismo in Urss, né la
rivoluzione cinese, con la grande Rivoluzione culturale proletaria.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left" style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span>
     Per
i comunisti rivoluzionari, per gli operai d'avanguardia la Comune
deve essere più viva che mai. Questa grande prima esperienza della
classe operaia fornisce lezioni teoriche, politiche, ideologiche, e
pratiche che mostrano che
     <b>
      il proletariato ha una sola soluzione la
conquista del potere politico con la rivoluzione,
     </b>
     e che col
potere nelle proprie mani il proletariato con i suoi "decreti"
affronta e risolve in pochi giorni problemi fondamentali delle masse
che oggi sembrano irrisolvibili.

   Las detenciones están relacionadas con hechos ocurridos durante
 la jornada de lucha estatal contra el genocidio en la Franja de Gaza 
del pasado 7 de febrero y han sido puertas en libertad con cargos.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
   Las diez activistas son acusadas de los delitos de desórdenes 
públicos, daños, manifestación ilícita y grupo criminal, que pueden 
comportar penas de prisión.
   <br>
</br></i>
</p>
<p>
  Las diez activistas habían sido detenidas en diferentes lugares del 
Área Metropolitana de Barcelona en un operativo coordinado por la 
Comisaría General de Información de los Mossos d’Esquadra.
 </p>
<p>
  Las ocho detenciones iniciales se produjeron el lunes 18 de marzo y 
todas las personas arrestadas pasaron una primera noche en los calabozos
 de la comisaría de Les Corts. Durante la mañana de martes les empezaron
 a tomar declaración en comisaría, pero no fue hasta el miércoles que 
fueron trasladadas a la
  <i>
   Ciutat de la Justícia
  </i>
  para pasar a 
disposición judicial. Las dos personas restantes fueron detenidas al 
mediodía y por la tarde de martes, respectivamente.
 </p>
<p>
  A las diez personas solidarias se las acusa de delitos de desórdenes 
públicos, daños, manifestación ilícita y grupo criminal, que pueden 
comportar penas de prisión. Para exigir su liberación se convocaron 
acciones el martes por la tarde ante la comisaría y el miércoles por la 
mañana en la
  <i>
   Ciutat de la Justícia
  </i>
  . Las convocatorias recibieron el apoyo de distintos colectivos solidarios con Palestina y antirrepresivos, entre ellos
  <i>
   Egida – Defensa Col·lectiva Anarquista.
  </i>
</p>
<p>
  Las personas activistas participaron en la jornada de lucha del 
pasado 7 de febrero convocada con el lema “Estimamos la vida, defendemos
 a Palestina, paramos el mundo” en que miles de personas se movilizaron 
en toda Cataluña y otros puntos del Estado coincidiendo con los cuatro 
meses del inicio de la nueva ofensiva genocida del Estado de Israel 
contra el pueblo palestino. En esa jornada, en que los sindicatos CGT y 
IAC convocaron huelga parcial en Catalunya,  se exigió 
multitudinariamente la ruptura de relaciones económicas e 
institucionales con el Estado de Israel. En las movilizaciones, las 
empresas Indra, Carrefour, Comsa, AXA y McDonald’s fueron señaladas como
 “cómplices” de la violencia contra la población palestina.

  Plusieurs dizaines de personnes ont pris pour cible le 
commissariat de La Courneuve (Seine-Saint-Denis) dimanche soir, 
procédant à d’importants tirs de mortiers d’artifice et de projectiles. 
Des renforts ont dû être déployés pour sécuriser le bâtiment. Cette 
révolte a éclaté suite à la mort d’un jeune, tué quatre jours plus tôt 
dans une collision avec un véhicule de police, alors qu’il circulait sur
 un scooter à Aubervilliers. Neuf personnes ont été arrêtées suite à ces
 affrontements.

<p>
   Ready for war." This is what the German army is should become 
again. For this, the Ministry of Defense, which reports to the german 
defense minister Boris Pistorius, has now presented a concept paper as a
 proposal in which initial measures are set out to drive forward in the 
rearmament of the german military
  </p>
<p>
   The document is entitled "Bundeswehr of the Future". Bundeswehr is 
the name of the german military. The document lists various points that 
need to be implemented in order to make the German army "fit for war" 
again. One of these points is the strengthening of the military 
branches. Military branches are a part of the armed forces divided into 
various specialized areas. In Germany, the military comprises three 
branches. The army, navy and air force. In the future, however, there 
will also be a fourth branch of the armed forces, which concerns the 
area of "cyber and information space".
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, there will also be restructuring in the command of 
operations aimed at strengthening centralization. An "operational 
leadership command of the Bundeswehr" is to be created in future. All 
Bundeswehr operations, whether at home or abroad, would then be 
centrally controlled and coordinated by this command.
  </p>
<p>
   Furthermore, under the motto: "The Bundeswehr as a whole must be 
geared towards an emergency", it is demanded that the Bundeswehr must be
 put in a logistical position to be able to make war at any time.
   <br>
   To
 this end, the military administration should already be planning ahead 
for "emergencies". Accordingly, requirements such as infrastructure, 
personnel, material, etc. should be identified and made available.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Even if only in passing, the document also raises the issue of 
military conscription. The document proposes structural and process 
changes, particularly in the area of personnel. The structures should 
operate "largely smoothly" and "especially in
   <br>
   situations of extreme turmoil and great coordination effort on the part of the state
   <br>
   be
 able to fold up." To this purpose, a coordination center is also to be 
created to "control the personnel growth capability". This should be in a
 position to "quickly ensure that personnel requirements are met". In 
other words, in the case of war, they conscript masses of young people 
as cannon fodder for the German bourgeoisie.
  </br></br></p>
<p>
   The creation of such a coordination office is also relevant for a 
future reintroduction of a compulsory military service. It is well known
 that the German Minister of Defense, or one could rather say Minister 
of War, Pistorius, is a vehement campaigner for the reintroduction of 
compulsory military service. In this context, it also makes sense that 
he is calling for the creation of structures that would be able to 
operate immediately after the introduction of such military 
conscription.
  </p>
<p>
   Ultimately, it can be said that the German bourgeoisie is 
increasingly calling for war.  The introduction to the above-mentioned 
document already makes it clear, that it is not about using the german 
military as a defensive army.
  </p>
<p>
   So they write:
   <br/>
   "Germany, as a globally networked nation in all 
respects, will therefore have to be able to counter threats and 
destabilization at home, in Europe and in the world at all times in the 
future. To this end, the Bundeswehr also provides politicians with 
instruments for action."
  </p>
<p>
   Even if there is always talk of "defending" Germany, it is much more 
about defending the economic interests of German imperialism with fire 
and steel all over the world against the oppressed people and 
imperialist competitors. A fact that is confirmed by germanys actual 
military operations.

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central 
Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and 
others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to
 celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit
 and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies
 upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose
 the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize 
Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the 
imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson 
for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India 
(Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical 
Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat 
Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” 
Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack 
the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, 
accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating 
exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, 
Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation 
through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged 
promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and 
socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

    NATO-Generalsekretär Jens Stoltenberg forderte jüngst die Umstellung auf Kriegswirtschaft, in der EU debattiert man die nukleare Bewaffnung der Union und Österreich verpflichtete sich 1,17 Milliarden jährlich an die Ukraine zu zahlen. Das sind nur die Spitzen der derzeitigen militärischen Vorstöße, die den Kriegskurs vorantreiben sollen. Ungeachtet der Neutralität, wird die österreichische Bevölkerung in die Kriegspläne der Herrschenden hineingezogen. Wie kann dem entgegengetreten werden?

    In einem „gemeinsamen Entschließungsantrag“ des EU-Parlaments stimmten die österreichischen Abgeordneten Ende Februar 2024 zu, jährlich 0,25 Prozent des BIP (rund 1,17 Milliarden Euro) für den Krieg in der Ukraine zu finanzieren. Zudem wurde eine militärische Unterstützung der Ukraine und die weitere Aufrüstung Österreichs beschlossen. In dem Originaldokument wird festgehalten,
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „dass alle Mitgliedstaaten der EU und alle Verbündeten in der NATO die Ukraine militärisch mit mindestens 0,25 % ihres BIP jährlich unterstützen sollten (...)“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (1). NATO und EU gehen also Hand in Hand was die Durchsetzung der Kriegsinteressen der „westlichen“ Imperialisten betrifft – und Österreich geht mit! Matthew Karnitschnig, Journalist der US-Politikfachzeitschrift Politico, formulierte die NATO-Pläne für Österreich folgendermaßen:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „Österreich ist ein Land der ‚Herr Karl‘, das alle Seiten bedient, sich zu westlichen Idealen bekennt, während es im Stillen nach Wegen sucht, um weiterhin von den freundschaftlichen Beziehungen zu Moskau zu profitieren. (…) Heute ist die österreichische Neutralität kaum mehr als eine bequeme Ausrede, um sich vor der Verantwortung zu drücken (…) Österreich ist ein Trittbrettfahrer seiner Nachbarn und der USA (…) Bis zum heutigen Tag beherzigen Österreicher selten die besseren Engel ihrer Natur, es sei denn, die Außenwelt zwingt sie dazu, entweder durch Beschämung oder rohe Gewalt.“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (2) Erklärungen wie diese lassen einen Schauer über den Rücken ziehen und geben einen Hinweis darauf, was uns als EU-Mitglied und „NATO-Partner“ noch blühen wird. Anders sehen das die Herrschenden Österreichs, die sich zu größten Teilen bereitwillig an diesem Kurs beteiligen. Der österreichische Bundesheer-Brigadier Robert Brieger, derzeit Vorsitzender des EU-Militärausschusses, findet sogar die Debatte rund um eine atomare Bewaffnung der EU „legitim“ (3).

    Die militärische Aufrüstung in der EU zielt ab in Richtung „Kriegswirtschaft“. So wird im oben genannten EU-„Entschließungsantrag“ festgehalten, dass die Verteidigungsproduktion erheblich gesteigert werden und der Waffenproduktion für die Ukraine Vorrang eingeräumt werden muss. Außerdem fordert der Entschließungsantrag die EU und ihre Mitgliedsstaaten dazu auf,
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „die europäische militärische Zusammenarbeit in der Industrie und auf Ebene der Streitkräfte
    </span>
</span>

   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">

</span>
<span>

   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     machen, der mit der NATO interoperabel und komplementär zu ihr ist“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (4) Die EU-Aufrüstungspläne sind also „interoperabel“ und „komplementär“ zu den Plänen der NATO, insbesondere der USA. Insgesamt resultiert das aus einer komplexen und schwierigen Lage in der sich der US-Imperialismus befindet: er kann seine Hegemonie, die im Niedergang begriffen ist, nur erhalten, wenn seine Allianzpartner ihre militärischen Kapazitäten und Kompetenzen erhöhen und er die zahlreichen militärischen Konflikte nicht alleine austragen muss. Daher wird auch der Druck auf die „Partner“ erhöht, was sich beispielsweise in der Androhung Trumps ausdrückt, nur jene NATO-Mitgliedsstaaten zu unterstützen, die auch dementsprechend aufrüsten. Es drückt sich aber auch im kürzlich stattgefundenen Besuch einer Vertreterin des US-Finanzministeriums bei Raiffeisenbank und Behörden in Wien aus, bei dem ein Ausschluss aus dem US-Finanzsystem angedroht wurde, falls Russland-Sanktionen umgangen werden. All das zeigt, dass Länder wie Österreich zunehmend dazu gezwungen werden, sich zu „disziplinieren“ und noch weiter der US-Hegemonie unterzuordnen. Dabei sind die Herrschenden in Österreich und der EU keine „Marionetten“, sondern erhoffen sich möglichst große eigene Vorteile. Es ist offensichtlich: Wenn die österreichische Bevölkerung sich nicht weiter in die Kriegstreiberei hineinziehen lassen will, muss sie selbst für die Wiederherstellung der Neutralität und gegen Aufrüstung und Militarisierung kämpfen!

    Während im Zeitraum 2022 bis 2027 die Militärausgaben um 85 Prozent steigen sollen, das sind plus 2,3 Milliarden Euro, sinken beispielsweise die Gesundheitsausgaben im selben Zeitraum um 52 Prozent, bzw. 2,9 Milliarden. Die Einsparungen im Gesundheitswesen sind auch ein Resultat des EU-Fiskalpakts und der EU-Kommission. Nick Witney, ein früherer Chef des EU-Rüstungsamtes, erklärte vor geraumer Zeit, warum sich die EU in solche Fragen der nationalen Budgetpolitik einmischt:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „Wenige Abgeordnete wollen ihrer Wählerschaft begründen, warum deren Steuern für Kampfhubschrauber statt für Spitäler verwendet werden soll (…) Militärische Operationen kosten Geld und riskieren Menschenleben (…) Nur ein eiserner politischer Wille, untermauert von klarem Zielbewusstsein, kann dafür sorgen, dass sich diese strategische Orientierung gegen kurzfristige Unannehmlichkeiten durchsetzt.“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (5) Diese „kurzfristigen Unannehmlichkeiten“ sind heute beinharte Realität und die Zeichen stehen auf weitere Verschlechterungen. Sozialabbau, Abbau demokratischer Rechte und Aufrüstung sind das Programm der Stunde, dass den Massen durch die Herrschenden aufgezwungen wird. Dieses Programm erfordert entschiedene Ablehnung, Widerstand und Kampf – gegen NATO, EU und die Herrschenden Österreichs!

    Nachdem vor rund zwei Jahren ein erster Vorstoß zur offiziellen Beseitigung der Neutralität relativ schnell fallen gelassen wurde, wird seither in raschen Schritten die völlige Aushöhlung der Neutralität praktiziert. In Worten verteidigen Politiker verschiedener Couleur die Neutralität, während sie in Taten nur mehr selten Beachtung findet. Die Wiederherstellung der Neutralität wird zur Forderung jener, die sich gegen diese Entwicklungen stellen – und das sind viele!

    Im Februar dieses Jahres wurde eine Umfrage veröffentlicht, laut der 51 Prozent folgendem zustimmen:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „Österreichs Neutralität ist ausgehöhlt“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (1). Rund 80 Prozent sind für die Beibehaltung der Neutralität. Das bedeutet, dass die absolute Mehrheit der Bevölkerung gegen die Abschaffung der Neutralität ist. Das in Worten praktizierte Festhalten der Herrschenden spielt also die Rolle des Betrugs und der Besänftigung der Bevölkerung. Denn während amtierende Politiker sich nicht die Finger verbrennen wollen, sind ehemalige da nicht so zimperlich. Die ehemalige Außenministerin Ursula Plassnik bedient dazu den plattesten Angriff auf die Neutralität:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „Unser liebstes Kleidungsstück ist die Tarnkappe, die hierzulande Neutralität heißt“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (2). Der ehemalige Bundeskanzler Wolfgang Schüssel (ÖVP) meint:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „Die Neutralität bietet keinen Schutz.“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (3) Ein Kreis (ehemaliger) SPÖ-Diplomaten, der den SP-Chef Babler schon seit Beginn berät (die sogenannte „Initiative Demokratische Außenpolitik“) meint:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „Die Neutralität wird in der SPÖ oft überhöht“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    und spricht sich gegen
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „nostalgischen Neutralismus“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (4) aus. Der ORF, derzeit ein Einpeitscher eines neuen Anlaufs der Debatte über einen NATO-Beitritt, propagiert die Plattform „unseresicherheit.org“. Diese verbreitete bisher zwei „offene Briefe“ an
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „den Bundespräsidenten, die Bundesregierung, den Nationalrat und die Bevölkerung Österreichs“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    , in denen eine Debatte über die Abschaffung der Neutralität gefordert wird. Zu den Unterstützern dieser Initiative zählen neben zahlreichen Unternehmern und Diplomaten auch bspw. Othmar Karas (ÖVP), Johannes Kopf (Vorstandsmitglied AMS) und diverse bekannte Gesichter der SPÖ, wie Rudolf Fußi und Robert Misik. All diese Beispiele verdeutlichen, dass das formelle Festhalten an der Neutralität, bei gleichzeitiger Aushöhlung, schon Teil ihrer Abschaffung ist. Verteidigungsministerin Tanner formulierte:
   </span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     „(…) die Neutralität heißt, keinem Militärbündnis
    </span>
</span>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
      auf absehbare Zeit
     </span>
</span>
</span>
<span style="font-style:italic">
<span>
     beizutreten“
    </span>
</span>
<span>
    (5). Unterschiedlichste „Interpretationen“ zur Neutralität stehen ebenfalls auf der Tagesordnung: während Tanner das Wort „immerwährend“ mit „auf absehbare Zeit“ ersetzt, betonen andere vor allem den rein „militärischen“ Charakter der Neutralität. Auch das ist natürlich eine Spitzfindigkeit, um politische Interessen durchzusetzen.

    In der derzeitigen Lage kann es also nicht nur darum gehen, die Neutralität als Gesetz beizubehalten, sondern auch die tatsächliche Einhaltung, also die Wiederherstellung der Neutralität einzufordern. Die bürgerlichen Parteien sind dabei allesamt keine Alternative, da sie lediglich verschiedenen Schattierungen einer Aushöhlung der Neutralität repräsentieren. Die Aufgabe des Kampfes um die Verteidigung und Wiederherstellung der Neutralität liegt auf den Schultern der Massen, der Bevölkerung. Nicht der Stimmzettel bei einer Wahl, sondern nur der aktive Zusammenschluss und Kampf wird Erfolge bringen. Die Verteidigung der Neutralität bedeutet heute die Interessen Volkes gegen jene der Herrschenden durchzusetzen.

  Εκατοντάδες αγωνιστές ανταποκρίθηκαν στο κάλεσμα των «Οργανώσεων – Συλλογικοτήτων της Θεσσαλονίκης» και Μελών της Παλαιστινιακής Κοινότητας της Θεσσαλονίκης, για να καταδικάσουν και να καταγγείλουν προς το λαό της πόλης την συνεχιζόμενη πολιτική γενοκτονίας του παλαιστινιακού λαού στην Λωρίδα της Γάζας, από το σιωνιστικό κράτος με όπλα τις χιλιάδες βόμβες, την πείνα και τις αρρώστιες. Συγκεντρώθηκαν και διαδήλωσαν για να καταγγείλουν τους δυτικούς προστάτες του φασιστικού κράτους του Ισραήλ, τους ιμπεριαλιστές των ΗΠΑ- ΝΑΤΟ και ΕΕ, αλλά και την ολοένα και βαθύτερη εμπλοκή της χώρας μας στην σφαγή στην Παλαιστίνη.

  Πριν από τις 7μμ άρχισε να συγκεντρώνεται κόσμος στο Άγαλμα Βενιζέλου, που άρχισε να γεμίζει τον χώρο. Η μικροφωνική έπαιζε επαναστατικά παλαιστινιακά τραγούδια, ενώ διαβάστηκε και η ανακοίνωση των διοργανωτών. Ιδιαίτερα συγκινητική ήταν η στιγμή που διαβάστηκε το ποίημα ενός δολοφονημένου από τις σιωνιστικές βόμβες, Παλαιστίνιου της Γάζας.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
  Πολύ ενθαρρυντική υπήρξε η συμμετοχή αρκετών δεκάδων Παλαιστίνιων προσφύγων και μελών της Παλαιστινιακή Κοινότητας της Θεσσαλονίκης, που έδωσαν παλμό και μαχητικότητα τόσο στη συγκέντρωση όσο και στην διαδήλωση που ακολούθησε. Η μέρα αυτή έχει ιδιαίτερη σημασία για τον Παλαιστινιακό λαό μιας και είναι η μνήμη της μάχης του αλ-Καραμά, που διεξήχθηκε στις 21/3 του 1968, ενάντια στα σιωνιστικά στρατεύματα. Ταυτόχρονα μιας και είναι η Παγκόσμια Ημέρα κατά του Ρατσισμού, οι διοργανωτές ήθελαν υπογραμμίσουν τον δίκαιο αγώνα του λαού της Παλαιστίνης ενάντια στο καθεστώς του απαρτχάιντ που έχει επιβάλλει για πάνω από εφτά δεκαετίες το σιωνιστικό κράτος του Ισραήλ. Ένα καθεστώς που τα τελευταία χρόνια κλιμακώνει την πολιτική των φυλετικών διαχωρισμών σε βάρος των Παλαιστινίων και των Αράβων σε όλη την ιστορική Παλαιστίνη.

  Η διαδήλωση στην οποία συμμετείχαν με μπλοκ το ΚΚΕ(μ-λ), η ΟΚΔΕ, το ΝΑΡ, ο ΔΙΑΡΚΗΣ ΑΓΩΝΑΣ, κ.α. αλλά και στήριξαν με την παρουσία τους η ΔΕΑ, το ΞΕΚΙΝΗΜΑ, πορεύτηκε από την Εγνατία, προς την Αγίας Σοφίας και την Τσιμισκή, φώναξε συνθήματα μπροστά στο μισητό προξενείο των αμερικανών για να καταλήξει από την Αριστοτέλους ξανά στο Άγαλμα Βενιζέλου. Θετική ήταν και η συμμετοχή με πανό του Συλλόγου Φοιτητών Φυσικού, που συνεχίζει την κατάληψη ενάντια στο νόμο για τα ιδιωτικά πανεπιστήμια απαντώντας έμπρακτα στην πρόσφατη εισβολή των ΜΑΤ στη  ΣΘΕ και τις συλλήψεις φοιτητών αλλά και συνολικότερη προσπάθεια τρομοκράτησης των φοιτητικών αγώνων.

  Το ΚΚΕ(μ-λ) που το προηγούμενο διάστημα κατέβαλε σημαντική προσπάθεια για την επιτυχία αυτής της συγκέντρωσης- διαδήλωσης, συνέβαλε στην διακίνηση του κοινού Δελτίου Τύπου των Οργανώσεων – Συλλογικοτήτων, διακίνησε την «Προλεταριακή Σημαία» και συγκρότησε μαζικό και μαχητικό μπλοκ, φωνάζοντας αντιπολεμικά, αντιιμπεριαλιστικά συνθήματα αλληλεγγύης στον αγώνα του λαού της Παλαιστίνης.

  Οι «Οργανώσεις- Συλλογικότητες της Θεσσαλονίκης» στην οποία συμμετέχουν και μέλη της Παλαιστινιακής Κοινότητας, θα συναντηθούν τις αμέσως επόμενες μέρες για να καθορίσουν τις επόμενες δράσεις αλληλεγγύης στον παλαιστινιακό λαό.

   La vita di Tina Modotti (Udine, Italia, 1896 - Città del Messico, 1942) è stata segnata da alcuni degli eventi storici più importanti della prima metà del XX secolo: l'emigrazione economica degli europei in America, la nascita del cinema muto sulla costa occidentale degli Stati Uniti, i movimenti agrari post-rivoluzionari in Messico, l'ascesa del muralismo politico, il recupero della cultura indigena messicana, l'emancipazione delle donne nella sfera pubblica, la contrapposizione tra stalinisti e trotzkisti dopo la Rivoluzione russa del 1917 e la guerra civile spagnola.

   Fa parte di una generazione di donne che hanno dato un grande contributo alla fotografia negli anni Venti e ha esercitato una forte influenza sulla successiva fotografia messicana, da Manuel Álvarez Bravo a Graciela Iturbide. La Modotti fu introdotta alla pratica fotografica da Edward Weston, ma il suo lavoro, che sviluppa una visione molto personale, va oltre l'insegnamento formalista di Weston. Dopo essere emigrata economicamente dalla città italiana di Udine a San Francisco e Los Angeles, Modotti parte per il Messico, dove partecipa al "rinascimento messicano" e all'effervescenza culturale post-rivoluzionaria. Entrando a far parte del circolo di artisti e muralisti lì stabilitosi, combina rapidamente la "fotografia incarnata" con il formalismo di Weston. Attivista del Partito Comunista Messicano (PCM) dal 1927, denuncia la condizione dei diseredati, usa la sua macchina fotografica per denunciare la condizione dei diseredati, concentrandosi in particolare sulla costruzione di un nuovo mondo immaginario intorno alle donne messicane.

   Nel settembre del 1928 diventa la compagna di Julio Antonio Mella, giovane rivoluzionario cubano, con cui Tina vive un amore profondo e al cui fianco intensifica il lavoro di fotografa impegnata e di militante politica. Nel 1930 Modotti fu espulsa dal Messico per le sue attività comuniste. Visse per diversi anni in Unione Sovietica, dove il suo attivismo fotografico divenne attivismo. A metà degli anni Trenta, il Partito Comunista Sovietico la invia in Spagna. Durante la guerra civile, organizzò l'evacuazione dei "bambini di guerra", coordinò la gestione degli ospedali militari e svolse missioni di propaganda. Dopo la sconfitta dei repubblicani nel 1939, attraversò i Pirenei insieme a migliaia di esuli. Esausta e disillusa dall'esito della guerra di Spagna, dovette lasciare nuovamente l'Europa. Morì nel 1942 a Città del Messico.

   Ang Bayan

</p>
<p>
  Filipino women bear the worst effects of the neo-liberal policies imposed by US imperialism and its puppet state in the past four decades. Due to policies of liberalization, deregulation and privatization, they are further marginalized to the fringes of society, where they are forced to endure informal, insecure and jobs with slave-like wages.
 </p>
<p>
  The majority of women belong to the most exploited and oppressed sectors of society—workers, farmers and indigenous people, the rural and urban poor. In the past decade, more than half of them, age 15 and older, have not been counted as part of the labor force because of the nature of the jobs they perform. Among them are the millions of housewives who engage in farm work and accept “sideline” jobs while burdened with heavy housework and childcare. In 2022, about 20 million were excluded from the labor force, unemployed and underemployed.
 </p>
<p>
  Seven out of every ten women considered employed are in the service sector. Jobs here are classified as “low-skilled” and are irregular. This is despite women’s relatively higher educational attainment.
 </p>
<p>
  In the manufacturing sector, 90% of women are “irregular” and very few (2.7%) are under unions. A significant number of women are in factories of big foreign capitalists within the export processing zones, making them part of the international assembly line (what imperialists call the global value chain). Foreigners are said to “prefer” female workers because of their docility, skill in detailed work such as assembling semiconductors or sewing, and flexibility in overtime. The truth is, these qualities are not inherent in women, but arise from desperation resulting from the acute employment crisis, which capitalists and labor agencies exploit.
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore, they are generally paid less, compared to men. In the clothing industry, for example, their wage levels are generally 17%-25% lower.
 </p>
<p>
  Manufacturing companies pay literally small change to urban poor women who they contract wholesale to perform some part of the assembly work. They are what the International Labor Organization calls “home-based” industrial workers. Some of their jobs are small-scale sewing, embroidery, assembling small household items, food manufacturing, making handicrafts and tourist decorations and others.
 </p>
<p>
  Among freelancers, women in digital jobs earn 18.4% less, compared to men. This is due to the “traditional view” that women are more suited to the type of jobs that are “less complex” such as encoding, as opposed to “more complex” and higher value-added jobs such as digital design which is said to be “more suitable” for men.
 </p>
<p>
  In agriculture, women farm workers receive 8% to 15% less wages, compared to the already meager wages of men. (Both daily wages are lower compared to the wages of service and industrial workers, and all wages are insufficient for their families’ needs.) More often than not, women (and children) are not paid because their role in production are considered “extensions of housework.”
 </p>
<p>
  To support their families, many women leave their children behind, go out of the country to work as maids, nannies and other jobs that expose them to extreme exploitation, oppression, violence, and in some cases, their deaths. In 2022, 1.10 million women (60.2%) emigrated, compared to 726,000 men (39.8%). Despite this, the average remittances of female migrant workers are lower (₱61,000) compared to men (₱126,000).
 </p>
<p>
  In rural areas, women farmers suffer widespread landlessness. A very small number (6.1%) have sole or shared ownership of land. They bear the brunt of the problem of high prices of farm inputs, low prices of produce and losses during calamities. A large majority are in debt to moneylenders and microfinance institutions, not only for production, but for the daily needs of their families.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Vogliamo mettere al centro
alcuni aspetti che ci sono dietro la mobilitazione per la Palestina
che si è sviluppata nel nostro paese e che raccoglie tutta una serie
di necessità e indicazioni rispetto a quella che è la prospettiva
internazionale dei popoli per liberarsi dall'imperialismo contro i
piani di guerra e la guerra imperialista e il genocidio che avvengono
in Palestina, ma che avvengono anche in altri paesi, dove ci sono, e
si sviluppano, le guerre popolari.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  La Palestina è
un'opportunità per i proletari, per le forze comuniste ed è parte
del lavoro che dobbiamo portare avanti anche nel nostro paese per
smascherare quello che ci sta dietro, la disumanità di questo
sistema imperialista/capitalista che bisogna abbattere perché o
socialismo o barbarie.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Ogni giorno la
Palestina ci dà questa indicazione. Fino a dove arriva questo
sistema imperialista che compie i peggiori crimini e li compie
quotidianamente verso le masse, verso i proletari, verso i popoli che
rialzano la testa.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Per questo oggi è
necessario continuare le mobilitazioni contro il genocidio del popolo
palestinese. E non bisogna mai perdere di vista - e dimenticare –
il perché avviene questo genocidio da parte di Israele e della
copertura dell'imperialismo principalmente USA, ma anche la
complicità di tanti altri paesi imperialisti, tra cui il nostro
governo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Questo genocidio
avviene come una risposta all’azione della resistenza del 7
ottobre. Il 7 ottobre ha
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 indicato la strada a tutti i popoli che
l'unica soluzione è quella di rialzare la testa e lottare con tutti
i mezzi necessari per la liberazione dall'apartheid, dal sionismo,
generati dal sistema imperialista.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  I palestinesi non
sono come vorrebbero le “anime belle” del movimento o dei partiti
riformisti che li vogliono sempre come vittime passive del dominio
coloniale israeliano, ma la grande azione del 7 ottobre delle forze
della resistenza ha messo al centro l'uso della violenza da parte
degli oppressi, dei colonizzati, nella loro lotta per le loro
liberazione contro gli oppressori. E questo fa paura a tutti i
governi e le borghesie imperialiste nel mondo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Quindi c’è un
legame tra resistenza e guerra imperialista, all'interno di un
contesto internazionale di crisi dell'imperialismo e del suo
tentativo di uscirne attraverso le guerre interimperialiste, mentre i
popoli oppressi, gli sfruttati, i proletari, gli operai non hanno
nulla da perdere che le loro catene e organizzare la loro guerra di
popolo per spazzare via governi, Stati imperialisti al servizio dei
profitti dei padroni.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Quando i popoli
rompono il monopolio della violenza della borghesia, questa ha paura
perché si agita lo spettro della sua fine come classe parassitaria.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Noi, in questo
contesto generale, internazionale, e all'interno del nostro paese,
dobbiamo fare la nostra parte di comunisti. In particolare nel nostro
paese, nella prospettiva che l'esempio della resistenza palestinese è
la resistenza che serve anche qua in Italia. La Palestina è
l'esempio dei popoli che lottano. La liberazione del popolo
palestinese è la liberazione di tutti gli oppressi. Dobbiamo scendere
in piazza con questo spirito, portarlo nelle mobilitazioni per legare
la solidarietà al popolo palestinese, alla lotta contro chi tutti i
giorni non ci dà garanzie: agli operai quelle di lavoro, ai giovani
di futuro, agli studenti solo scuole-caserme.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Noi siamo in
mezzo a questo movimento della Palestina per portare anche noi il
nostro contributo, le nostre proposte perché questa lotta diventi
sempre più efficace e diventi sempre più una lotta politica contro
il governo fascista Meloni, contro il comitato di affari odierno
della borghesia imperialista che sta facendo affari ed è complice
con le armi ed è complice attiva del genocidio ed è uno dei
maggiori sponsor di Netanyahu e del governo fascista/nazisionista
israeliano.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Per questo sono
necessari i Comitati di solidarietà per la Palestina, in cui le
forze di sostegno alla Palestina si devono unire ai comitati e alle
associazioni dei palestinesi sulla strada dell'internazionalismo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Così come è
sempre al centro anche la battaglia per una delegazione
internazionale che metta a nudo quelli che sono anche le
responsabilità dei governi imperialisti, come quello italiano.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Queste parole
d'ordine di fase sono necessarie dopo la mobilitazione del 23 e 24
febbraio a livello nazionale: la giornata di sciopero del 23 che ha
visto scendere in campo una parte di lavoratori, in particolare nella
logistica a fianco della solidarietà palestinese e la giornata del
24 con una grande manifestazione a Milano che ha compattato una parte
delle forze che si definiscono comuniste, antimperialiste, di classe,
solidali con la lotta e la resistenza del popolo palestinese, senza
se e senza ma.

</a>
  Di tutto questo
forse ne ha più coscienza il governo Meloni che in queste settimane
non a caso dopo queste iniziative del 23 e 24, risponde alzando il
livello della repressione, come è successo la montatura de L'Aquila
con cui si vorrebbe definire terrorista chi lotta per la liberazione
del proprio popolo: Anan, Mansur, Alì, è un messaggio preciso che il
governo vuole mandare per intimidire tutte le forze dei palestinesi e
dei solidali che si sono mobilitati.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Ma non ci
riusciranno se riusciremo ad estendere e a essere sempre più
incisivi nel lavoro, in ogni nostro posto, in ogni città dove siamo
presenti, perché ci siano delle mobilitazioni sempre più adeguate a
questi sviluppi. Questo è quello che stiamo facendo, anche nella
realtà specifica di Bergamo.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Una delle
questioni principali è quello di tornare alle fabbriche, è quella
di tornare tra gli operai per farli schierare, per fargli prendere
posizione, per scendere in campo effettivamente, per cercare di
spiegare il legame tra Palestina/guerra/governo, perché la
resistenza della Palestina è il nostro migliore alleato contro una
guerra che torna a casa e che in Italia sta generando un regime di
moderno fascismo, di repressione, di aumento dei morti sul lavoro, di
non soddisfazione di nessun bisogno delle masse, sanitario, di
lavoro, di futuro e di prospettiva. Solamente guerra.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Infatti il nostro
governo è in guerra  nel Mar Rosso contro il popolo
palestinese. Per questo sosteniamo e operiamo perché si estendono le
iniziative, le azioni dirette di denuncia, di mobilitazione contro le
università e i loro legami con Israele, contro le fabbriche come la
Leonardo o tante altre che in Italia producono armi che vengono date
per compiere il massacro in Palestina, contro un governo fascista che
vieta le manifestazioni e si spaccia per essere a difesa dei semiti,
proprio lui che rappresenta il filo nero di questo paese. Al governo
in Italia ci sono gli amici dei nazisti, quelli che dicono che gli
ebrei devono essere messi al rogo e vogliono silenziare il movimento
di lotta dei palestinesi. Oggi in Italia c'è un governo che spinge
alla guerra, alla guerra imperialista, per gli interessi delle grandi
aziende delle armi e di tutto quello che è collegato con lo scontro
economico in atto a livello mondiale: il petrolio e gas.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Non c'è solo la
Leonardo, c'è l’ENI, c'è la Tenaris Dalmine che fornisce i tubi
per forare davanti a Gaza e portare via il petrolio ai palestinesi e
darlo agli israeliani. Queste sono tutte connivenze che devono essere
denunciate e spezzate.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Noi siamo parte
di tutti i popoli oppressi, dei proletari che vogliono costruire la
loro guerra giusta per farla finita con queste guerre ingiuste, con
queste guerre che arricchiscono pochi per il profitto e ci conducono
alla miseria, allo sfruttamento, al fascismo e alla repressione in
tutti i paesi in cui sono presenti.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Il migliore aiuto
al popolo palestinese è quello di colpire il nostro governo e tutti
i suoi sporchi interessi, dei padroni delle multinazionali delle
fabbriche di armi, ma anche contrastare la fabbrica di menzogne della
stampa, dei media asserviti, di tutto l'apparato dello Stato e delle
sue Istituzioni che non vogliono far altro che equiparare la lotta
dei palestinesi come come antisemita, quando nella realtà stanno
facendo un nuovo olocausto, perché questo sistema imperialista è
fondato sulla sopraffazione della dignità umana, sulla cancellazione
dei diritti dei popoli, sulla cancellazione dei diritti dei
lavoratori e della loro vita per tenerli sempre in schiavitù.

<p>
  Μαζί με τις υπόλοιπες αλλαγές που φέρνει φέτος το υπουργείο Παιδείας, σχεδιάζει και να κάνει πιο αυστηρή την διαχείριση των απουσιών και να επιβάλλει αυστηρότερες ποινές για ό,τι φυσικά το υπουργείο ορίζει ως «παράβαση»! Σχεδιάζει να επιβάλλει οικονομικές και ποινικές ευθύνες στους μαθητές που συμμετέχουν σε καταλήψεις αλλά και στους γονείς τους!
 </p>
<p>
  Στόχος του υπουργείου είναι να τρομοκρατήσει γονείς και μαθητές και να καταφέρει να καταστείλει τους μαθητικούς αγώνες. Αυτή η κίνηση είναι η συνέχεια μιας σειράς μέτρων τρομοκρατίας και καταστολής τα οποία εφάρμοσε το προηγούμενο διάστημα, όπως οι έφοδοι της αστυνομίας στα σχολεία, τα τηλεμαθήματα αλλά και η συνεχής τρομοκρατία από τις διευθύνσεις για τις ενδεχόμενες συνέπειες ύστερα από μια κατάληψη, μια αποχή, ή οποιαδήποτε άλλη πράξη εναντιώνεται στο κλίμα πειθάρχησης που θέλει το υπουργείο. Μέτρα τα οποία εφάρμοσε απευθείας για να σπάσει καταλήψεις, ενώ μερικές φορές δε χρειάστηκε καν αφού αρκούσε και μόνο η απειλή της δυνατότητας εφαρμογής τους.
 </p>
<p>
  Με τις νέες αυτές αλλαγές, σε συνδυασμό με μέτρα που ήδη έχουν περάσει (όπως τράπεζα θεμάτων, ελάχιστη  βάση εισαγωγής) αλλά και αυτά που ετοιμάζονται  (εθνικό απολυτήριο, πολλαπλό βιβλίο κλπ) θα επιβληθεί ένα κλίμα εντατικοποίησης και πειθάρχησης όπου κανένας δε θα σηκώνει κεφάλι. Στόχος τους είναι να μας αναγκάσουν να μην αγωνιζόμαστε, αφού θα είμαστε αντιμέτωποι είτε με ένα κλίμα φόβου, είτε με μια ασφυχτική εντατικοποίηση που δε θα έχουμε χρόνο για τίποτα πέρα από το διάβασμα. Φοβούνται τους αγώνες των μαθητών απέναντι στα μέτρα που τους  ετοιμάζουν, όπως το εθνικό απολυτήριο, σύμφωνα με το οποίο θα μετράνε οι βαθμοί και των τριών τάξεων του Λυκείου για την εισαγωγή στο πανεπιστήμιο. Με αυτόν τον τρόπο όχι μόνο θα αποκλείονται από την Τριτοβάθμια Εκπαίδευση παιδιά των οποίων οι οικογένειες τους είναι φτωχές και δεν έχουν καν την οικονομική δυνατότητα να καλύπτουν όλα τα φροντιστήρια τα οποία θα απαιτούνται προκειμένου να καταφέρουν να ανταπεξέλθουν στις απαιτήσεις αυτής της υπέρογκης ύλης, αλλά θα δύσκολέψει ακόμη και η  απόκτηση του απολυτήριου Λυκείου.
 </p>
<p>
  Καθιστούν πιο αυστηρές τις ποινές στο ποινολόγιο και αυστηροποιούν τις απουσίες επαναφέροντας τις 50 αδικαιολόγητες και 50 δικαιολογημένες, προκειμένου να τρομοκρατήσουν τους μαθητές για τις ποινές που θα τους περιμένουν! Όλα αυτά τα μέτρα τρομοκρατίας το υπουργείο λοιπόν τα περνάει γιατί φοβάται τους μαθητικούς αγώνες! Και τούς φοβάται γιατί ξέρει τι μπορούν να καταφέρουν!
 </p>
<p>
  Δεν πρέπει λοιπόν να αφήσουμε κανένα από τα νέα μέτρα να περάσει. Πρέπει να αγωνιστούμε και να τα  ανατρέψουμε. Ούτε εθνικό απολυτήριο, ούτε ιδιωτικά πανεπιστήμια, ούτε ποινολόγια! Πρέπει να οργανωθούμε με συνελεύσεις, καταλήψεις! Με τους αγώνες μας μπορούμε να ανατρέψουμε όλα τα μέτρα που έχουν ως στόχο να μας τρομοκρατήσουν, αλλά συνολικά και να ανατρέψουμε το μαύρο μέλλον που μας ετοιμάζουν!

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  La stampa economica dei quotidiani di ieri ha riportato che alla
Unilever Group da 59,6 miliardi, la nuova dirigenza per conquistare
la fiducia degli investitori e recuperare margini di profitto, ha
dichiarato l'intenzione di scorporare la sezione gelati, un settore
stagionale e con una logistica più complessa. E di preparare un
taglio da 7500 posti di lavoro.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nella sua
semplicità questa notizia economico politica apre ad una grande
verità che oggi ci è utile per tornare sul fatto che gli interessi
dei padroni sono antagonisti, inconciliabili a quelli degli operai,
di tutti i proletari. Semplicità naturalmente non vuol dire banale,
lo possiamo notare se da un altro punto di vista osserviamo lo stato
della classe operaia oggi.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  L'individualismo
fa danni enormi dentro le fabbriche, un modo di essere e di pensare
che gli operai hanno assorbito e che porta a dire: “la lotta mette
a rischio il posto di lavoro o il mutuo, devo pensare alla mia
situazione”.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Ma è la vita
nella società capitalista che è a rischio, quella dovrebbe
spaventare. Si muore di profitto, di povertà, per razzismo. Non c'è
un settore, un aspetto della vita, lavorativo, sociale, culturale,
che le masse popolari attraversano, che si salva, che non sia duro, a
rischio spaventoso o sotto attacco della reazione. E oggi ancora di
più nella tendenza generale ad un allargamento globale dei conflitti
con il nemico di casa nostra, imperialista e moderno fascista,
governo Meloni, che ci trascina ogni giorno che passa in queste
guerre.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nelle statistiche
per la povertà sono entrati in massa i lavoratori che non ce la
fanno più a raggiungere
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 la fine del mese. L'aumento dei prezzi è
certificato soprattutto nel settore alimentare. Si spende di più e
si porta a casa una quantità di spesa minore, e questi tagli, che
sono vere e proprie privazioni, i proletari li fanno pesantemente
anche sulla propria salute.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Tagli,
privatizzazione, aumento dei costi, strutture sotto organico, quando
non vengono chiuse, fanno ammalare, fanno morire per mancanza di
prevenzione, di cure. E cosa dire di
casa, lavoro, servizi sociali, scuola?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Tutto questo è
strettamente collegato alla fabbrica, a come la classe agisce e
reagisce nelle grandi fabbriche, alla necessità del lavoro politico
nelle fabbriche.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fabbrica oggi
l'ideologia borghese sottomette i lavoratori alla produzione
capitalista, li fa “stare nel proprio guscio”, per usare le
parole di un operaio. Come ti senti diverso dagli altri se parli di
politica, della guerra, degli investimenti in titoli di Stato fino a
50.000 €, che sono stati esclusi dall'Isee dal nuovo governo, se
fai delle proposte ti guardano come un alieno.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  “Qui tutto
sommato si sta ancora bene” - si dice - lo stipendio e il posto
fisso hanno prodotto un frutto avvelenato. Ognuno per sé e tutti
paghiamo, sottomessi alle condizioni di vita e di lavoro imposte dal
sistema capitalista che ha il suo centro nelle grandi fabbriche.
Fabbriche dove il livello di risposta è basso, anche agli attacchi
diretti alle condizioni di lavoro, al salario, al posto di lavoro,
alla salute e sicurezza, ai diritti sindacali, ai piani di
ristrutturazione o delocalizzazione che toccano tutti gli aspetti.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Complice
l'assenza di un movimento sindacale confederale di opposizione, la
sua azione è di controllo sui lavoratori anziché quella di impugnarne gli interessi. Azione che nel complesso
alimenta la subordinazione e la passività degli operai. Sono un
esempio di questo gli accordi sindacali che legano il salario e la
produttività, e spesso anche la sicurezza, alla promozione di fondi
integrativi per pensioni e sanità anziché alla difesa dei servizi
pubblici, vertenze su parole d’ordini rinunciatarie e confinate
alla singola fabbrica. E chiaramente, ancor di più, l'assenza di
attività contro il governo, contro la guerra, per la Palestina.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   Da una parte,
quindi, un bombardamento ideologico che attacca da più fronti la
classe operaia.
  </b>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
<b>
   Dall'altra le
forze di classe, rivoluzionarie, oggi piccole ma con una sola
alternativa: portare con ottimismo rivoluzionario
  </b>
  il lavoro
necessario verso gli operai perché le fabbriche devono e possano
tornare ad essere centro di socializzazione e di organizzazione di
classe, attraverso la lotta politica per sottrarre la classe operaia
all'influenza dell'ideologia borghese, nella prospettiva
rivoluzionaria, nella prospettiva della ricostruzione del partito
comunista.

  Uno strumento di
questo lavoro è la Controinformazione rossoperaia che ora esce come
quotidiano online e settimanale, stampato e diffuso alle portinerie.
Nella situazione attuale, in cui le forze sono limitate, i militanti
sono pochi, questo significa nel concreto portare
agli operai la situazione politica generale, la situazione di tutte
le classi della popolazione, la situazione dei movimenti che si
traduca in conoscenza per gli operai di quello che realmente succede, per farne alimento della coscienza politica di classe. E tra queste,
come si ricordava anche nella prima parte della controinformazione di
oggi, oggi c'è la solidarietà a fianco della resistenza
palestinese che non può mancare nell'attività verso gli operai, che
non deve sottomettersi alla parte arretrata, magari per guadagnare un
facile consenso di massa, cioè senza rompere con le posizioni
attuali.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Altro
indispensabile strumento è la Formazione Operaia, formazione
ideologica per lottare contro il predominio dell'ideologia borghese
dentro la classe, come abbiamo visto, contro il culto della
spontaneità che soffoca lo sviluppo della coscienza proletaria.

 Nella FO stiamo
riprendendo e utilizzando il testo di Lenin  Che fare? come arma
basilare per la lotta all'economismo, che influisce anche oggi in
maniera determinante nel separare i comunisti dall'avanguardia
operaia e le avanguardie operaie dai comunisti. L'economismo è il
primato della lotta sindacale sulla lotta politica, il primato
dell'organizzazione sindacale sull'organizzazione politica. Un lavoro
di studio da applicare all'attività, alla nostra attività, la
teoria come parte della battaglia, dove anche i militanti sono
strumenti e bersaglio della lotta teorica, militanti che incorrono
in errori anche spontaneamente che frenare lo sviluppo della coscienza, come si può comprendere anche dai passi di Lenin che mette in
guardia a proposito della lotta sindacale e della lotta politica.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Dice Lenin:
  <i>
   “esistono due politiche, la politica tradunionista e la politica
socialdemocratica, dato che gli economisti non negano in assoluto la
politica ma deviano continuamente dalla concezione socialdemocratica,
cioè rivoluzionaria, verso la concezione tradunionista della
politica, la concezione sindacale della politica. E non si tratta di
dare alla stessa lotta economica carattere politico o che alla lotta
economica è già di per sé lotta politica e che questo sia il
metodo di portare agli operai alla politica attraverso rivendicazioni
tangibili, al contrario. Il rivoluzionario approfitta dell'agitazione
economica non soltanto per presentare rivendicazioni di ogni genere,
ma anche innanzitutto per rivendicare la soppressione del regime
autocratico
  </i>
  ”.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Oggi, in questo
contesto di marcia verso un regime moderno fascista, ogni cosa
diventa politica e quindi diventa necessaria la formazione come guida
all'azione e rispetto ai compiti della politica rivoluzionaria,
agitazione di classe, propaganda, organizzazione. Senza fare la
nostra parte per uno studio sistematico di partito come possiamo fare
la battaglia e portare il problema della formazione tra la classe
operaia che, come dice Marx, possiede un elemento di successo, il
numero, ma il numero non pesa sulla bilancia se non quando è unito
in collettività ed è guidato dalla conoscenza? Perché l'attività politica, il lavoro per la rivoluzione proletaria del partito
comunista mlm è lo scopo delle nostre lotte che organizziamo, della denuncia della controinformazione e attraversa
tutti gli strumenti dell'attività quotidiana.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Formazione è uno
studio agente, legato alla pratica quotidiana, che permette
all'avanguardia di fare un passo avanti. Oggi il problema attuale non è fare
la rivoluzione, ma incarnare il primo passo per farla. Il primo passo
è costruire l'avanguardia forgiata dalla teoria e dal programma
necessario per farla. E che nel fuoco della lotta in stretto legame
con gli operai e le masse, sia in grado di trasformare questi libri
in uno strumento pratico, in un'indicazione che ci dia la forza
necessaria per invertire la rotta di un mondo orribile e
intraprendere la lotta vera per un mondo nuovo, fondato sul
rovesciamento delle classi dominanti e la costruzione del potere proletario, popolare con la sua classe più avanzata, la classe operaia, quella che
può realmente cambiare la produzione, il sistema sociale e costruire
uno Stato adatto a trasformare l'economia in economia al servizio del
popolo. Un'economia socialista.

  Nachdem die Arbeitskäufer die zweite Verhandlungsrunde der Tarifauseinandersetzung im öffentlichen Personennahverkehr in der Absicht die Streikmaßnahmen der Gewerkschaft auch jurisitsch anzugehen cancelten, haben diese in der dann dritten Verhandlungsrunde eine Frechheit von "Angebot" vorgelegt.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Dabei sind zentrale Forderungen der Arbeitskäufer:
 </p>
<p>
  1. Abkopplung des TV-N vom Tarifvertrage der Länder, insbesondere was eventuelle Lohnerhöhungen und Arbeitszeitverkürzungen angeht.
 </p>
<p>
  2. Erhöhung der Arbeitszeit von bisher möglichen 38 Stunden auf bis zu 44 Stunden pro Woche, ohne die Möglichkeit eines (steuerfreien) Freizeitausgleichs wie zuvor.
 </p>
<p>
  3. Absolute Friedenspflicht für DREI Jahre, d.h. Streikverbot auf für bislang nicht im Tarifvertrag geregelte Fragen.
 </p>
<p>
  Sich des Affront bewusst, behaupteten die Arbeitskäufer nach Ende der Gespräche schließlich, dass sie ein solches "Angebot" gar niemals vorgelegt hätten.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Während die Gewerkschaftsbürokratie, auch in Persona Paul Schmidt, versucht weiter einen versöhnlerischen Kurs zu fahren, ist die Stimmung unter den Arbeitern im ÖPNV, besonders in Leipzig, explosiv. Anstelle die Verhandlungen sofort abzubrechen wurde von Seiten der ver.di tatsächlich noch mit den Arbeitskäufern über deren "Angebot" verhandelt, bis schließlich die Gespräche als gescheitert erklärt wurden.
 </p>

</p>
<p>
  Es gibt darüber hinaus Berichte, dass in den Kreisen der kämpfenden Kollegen Nebelkerzen gezündet werden. Es wurden auch Forderungen von Kollegen laut, dass Gewerkschaftsfunktionäre zurücktreten sollen.
 </p>
<p>
  Heute zeigt sich erneut, dass der Streik durchaus erfolgreich von den Arbeitern im Nahverkehr geführt wird. Die Leipziger LVB war heute sogar nicht in der Lage einen Notfallfahrplan umzusetzen.

  Tjen Folket Media var til stede på en demonstrasjon utenfor Equinor sitt kontor på Sandsli i Bergen. Demonstranter blokkerte innkjørselen til kontorets parkeringsplass. Det var et samarbeid mellom miljø, og klimabevegelsen og palestina-aktivister. Demonstrantene krevde at Equinor skulle stoppe samarbeidet med det israelske selskapet Ithaca Energy og stoppe utbygging av Rosebank-oljefeltet.

  Ifølge demonstrantene gjennomføres det lignende aksjoner i Oslo, Florø, Stavanger og London. Demonstrasjonen var et samarbeid mellom aksjonsstemmer for Palestina, Stopp Oljeletinga og Extinction Rebellion. Demonstrantene var til stede tidlig på morgenen. Med palestinske flagg og plakater og banner med teksten “Equinor har skitne bånd – Olje og Israel hånd i hånd”.

  Demonstrantene begynte klokken 07.30. De holdt flere appeller og ropte slagord. Før klokken var 8 hadde det bygd seg opp lang kø i området. Og politiet ble dermed tvunget til å vise vekk disse bilene for å hindre at køen skulle bygge seg opp. Da klokken nærmet seg 9 var dermed området nesten tomt for biler.

  Tjen Folket Media har intervjuet flere av deltakerne og en talsperson for aksjonen.
 </p>
<p>
  En talsperson for aksjonen forklar hvorfor de demonstrerer:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “I dag har aksjonstemmer fra Palestina, stopp oljeletinga og extinction rebellion norge gått sammen for å demonstrere mot Rosebank-oljeplattformen som kommer til å ha katastrofale miljøkonsekvenser. I tillegg skal denne plattformen bygges sammen med Ithaca Energy. De er eid av israelske Delek Group. Som er svartelistet av FN og er selskap som bidrar til de ulovlige israelske bosettingene. Vi krever at regjeringen følger opp sin egeneierskapsmelding for Equinor. Der skriver de at selskap som Equinor, skal følge vitenskapsbaserte klimamål, kutte utslipp i tråd med disse, og at de skal inngå samarbeid med aktører som respekterer internasjonal humanitær rett. Det er det vi står for her i dag. At Equinor har et handlingsrom som de bør benytte. De bør avslutte Rosebank-plattformen og de bør avslutte samarbeidet med Ithaca Energy.”
  </p>

<p>
  Flere deltagere på aksjonen ble også intervjuet.
 </p>
<p>
  En aktivist forklarer hvorfor slike demonstrasjonsformer må til:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “Fordi det er veldig tragisk. Politikerne hører ikke på oss. De har ingen respekt for opinionen i Norge og folkeviljen. Og da man ty til mer ulydige og desperate metoder. Som streik og sivil ulydighet. Alt må til for å få slutt på folkemordet og okkupasjonen.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  En annen aktivist forklarte det slik:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “Det handler om Equinors rykte. Om folk skal se hva Equinor gjør må vi ta plass, må vi skrike høyt. Det er ikke nok. Vi tror ikke de har lyst å snakke med oss selv om vi prøver det. Miljøbevegelsen har prøvd det mange ganger. Equinor er ikke en aktør man kan ha en dialog med tror jeg.”
   <br>
</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Aktivisten forklarer hvorfor dialog med Equinor ikke fungerer:
 </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
<br>
   “Fordi hele selskapet er bygget på prinsippet om hele miljøet kan utnyttes og også at sårbare mennesker kan utnyttes. Ja, de kan jo ha en dialog med oss, men equinor kan ikke eksistere om de ikke gjør slike ting.”
  </br></p>

</figure>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>
  Aktivisten avsluttet med:
 </br></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>
   “Det er veldig fint å samle miljøbevegelsen og palestinabevegelsen her i dag. Det er veldig viktig. Å forklare og vise frem at disse problemene har noe med hverandre å gjøre. Jeg tror at solidaritet er det som avgjør om en bevegelse overlever eller faller sammen. Vi trenger en kritisk masse. Det er hele poenget i det vi gjør. Jeg er veldig stolt av å se dette samarbeidet.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Etter klokken 9 ble aksjonen avsluttet etter at det ikke lenger var biler å se i området. Aksjonistene lyktes med å avsløre samarbeidet statseide Equinor har med israelske Ithaca Energy som bidrar til okkupasjonen. Samtidig ble det sendt et signal om at selskapene ikke kan jobbe som normalt mens de bidrar til et pågående folkemord.

contradicciones: El desarrollo de la contradicción principal entre la nación
ucraniana y el imperialismo ruso; y, como secudaria, el desarrollo en medio de
colusión y pugna de la contradicción inter-imperialista (tercera
contradicción); principalmente, entre la superpotencia imperialista hegemónica
única, los EEUU y “aliados”, y la superpotencia atómica,Rusia; y, este
desarrollo, agudiza el desarrollo de la segunda contradicción (proletariado
burguesía) en los países imperialistas, como lo estamos mostrando en las

     La cuestión de un mayor apoyo militar a Ucrania
también se debate hoy en la base aérea estadounidense de Ramstein, en
Renania-Palatinado. Allí se reunirán ministros de Defensa y representantes
militares de alto rango por invitación del secretario de Defensa
estadounidense, Lloyd Austin, y también estará presente el ministro federal de
Defensa, Pistorius. Recientemente ha habido desacuerdos entre los socios
occidentales sobre el alcance de las entregas de armas a Ucrania. Alemania está
bajo presión para entregar misiles de crucero Taurus, lo que el Canciller
Scholz rechaza.

    Ahora las cosas son diferentes: desde hace días el debate
político gira en torno a una sola palabra del líder del grupo parlamentario del
SPD, Rolf Mützenich. La semana pasada, en el atril del Bundestag, formuló la
siguiente pregunta sobre la política ucraniana: Si no era hora no sólo de
hablar sobre cómo librar una guerra, "sino también de pensar en cómo congelar
una guerra y...
    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">
     "congelar".
- Esta expresión provocó que el ministro federal de Defensa, Boris Pistorius,
miembro del SPD, respondiera claramente el lunes durante un viaje al
extranjero: "Al final, esto sólo ayudaría a Putin". No debería haber
una paz dictada y "ninguna paz que conduzca a eso -o a un alto el fuego o
a un congelamiento- en el que Putin emerja más fuerte al final y continúe el
conflicto cuando le plazca", dijo Pistorius.
    </span>
    Ucrania debe seguir
recibiendo apoyo “sin peros”.

<span>
    Al menos el
pasaje de la declaración del gobierno de Olaf Scholz estaba casi escrito.
Scholz también dejó claro que Alemania es el mayor apoyo de Ucrania en Europa,
especialmente en lo que respecta a las capacidades de defensa del país. Y
durante el tiempo que ella lo necesite. Por esta aclaración, que en realidad no
es nueva, incluso recibió el agradecimiento del líder de la oposición y del
grupo parlamentario de la Unión, Friedrich Merz. Scholz respondió con una
tríada: más y duradero apoyo a Ucrania, ahora también con suministro
internacional de municiones, sin participación de la OTAN y sin "la paz
dictada". En su discurso de media hora, la Canciller logró no mencionar
los puntos críticos del debate de los últimos días: ni el sistema de armas
"Taurus" ni el "congelamiento" de Mützenich para perjudicar
al líder de la facción popular. Además, Scholz no necesariamente habrá
perturbado el debate de los últimos días. Especialmente en lo que respecta a la
política alemana en Ucrania, en su opinión, demasiadas personas en el Berlín
político se han preguntado por qué no se está cumpliendo más, pero muy raramente
se han preguntado si es necesario actuar con prudencia.

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-US">
<span>
    En
anteriores discursos de la coalición de semáforo sobre la cantidad adecuada o
el sistema de armas adecuado para apoyar a Ucrania, Scholz siempre apareció
inicialmente como el vacilante y más tarde como el impulsado por el FDP y los
políticos de defensa verdes, por ejemplo cuando estaba preocupado por la
entrega del carro de combate "Leopard" 2" decidió hacerlo tarde.
En este sentido, Mützenich incluso le hizo un favor, porque Scholz pudo presentarse
hoy como un hombre activo y un orador claro y dejar claro que no sólo Alemania,
pero también Europa, está acelerando el paso en su apoyo al país atacado.

    Siempre hay
diferencias sustanciales en la política ucraniana. En última instancia, los debates
recurrentes sobre la política ucraniana muestran la tensión sustancial en la
coalición semáforo para apoyar a Ucrania. Ha existido desde el comienzo de la
guerra de agresión de Rusia, que viola el derecho internacional. Existe el
deseo, especialmente entre los socios más pequeños de la coalición, de obtener
un apoyo mayor y más rápido de lo que Mützenich y su entorno en el SPD parecían
aconsejables. Recientemente, Agnieszka Brugger, de los Verdes, se pronunció a
favor del suministro del sistema de armas "Taurus", aunque Scholz se
había opuesto claramente: "El debate no puede terminar con Basta".
"La mejor garantía para nuestra seguridad es una derrota para Putin
"Por eso también apoyamos a Ucrania", dijo Brugger en el Bundestag la
semana pasada. Las vacilaciones y las dudas también pueden contribuir a la
escalada. Por eso el debate sobre "Tauro" "no puede terminar con
un solo pedazo de mierda". El posicionamiento de Mützenich también debe
entenderse como una respuesta a esto: al fin y al cabo, el líder del grupo
parlamentario del SPD logró desviar el interés público de Scholz y del debate
sobre "Taurus" que le molestaba, dice alguien cercano a él. Aún no
está claro si esto fue intencional o un efecto secundario.

    Las declaraciones del líder del grupo parlamentario del SPD,
Mützenich, sobre la guerra en Ucrania provocaron fuertes críticas, también en
la coalición. El líder del SPD, Klingbeil, defendió a Mützenich y habló de una
"interpretación errónea selectiva" de Caren Miosga.

<u>
     El motivo de la visita del líder del SPD, Lars Klingbeil,
a Caren Miosga no podría haber sido más oportuno
    </u>
    . El jueves pasado, el
líder del grupo parlamentario del SPD, Rolf Mützenich, causó revuelo con un
discurso en el Bundestag. En el pleno habló de "congelar" la guerra
en Ucrania y las posteriores negociaciones de paz con Rusia. Mützenich calificó
de "maliciosas" las críticas de la oposición y de los políticos del
semáforo al canciller Olaf Scholz: el líder del grupo parlamentario del SPD
había sido criticado varias veces por su elección de palabras, incluso por
parte de los partidos del semáforo. La ministra de Asuntos Exteriores, Annalena
Baerbock, se sentó visiblemente molesta durante el discurso en el estrado del
gobierno y meneó enérgicamente la cabeza. Los Verdes y el FDP se negaron a
aplaudir a Mützenich durante su discurso.

<u>
     Klingbeil: "Una mala interpretación deliberada de
este discurso"
    </u>
    El propio Klingbeil dijo el domingo por la tarde en el
programa de entrevistas de ARD Caren Miosga: "Creo que reducir el discurso
de Rolf Mützenich a este pasaje es una mala interpretación deliberada de este
discurso".
    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">
     Según el líder
del partido,
     <u>
      se trata de una “situación increíblemente controvertida” en la
que se encuentra el gobierno del semáforo
     </u>
     . Mützenich simplemente planteaba
una pregunta legítima y no está solo en su postura: en última instancia, el
presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyj también exigiría negociaciones de paz,
según Klingbeil. Zelenskyj efectivamente pide negociaciones de paz, pero al
mismo tiempo cita la retirada del El ejército ruso como base para las
conversaciones desde los territorios ocupados de Ucrania. Esto es totalmente
opuesto a la idea de “congelar” el conflicto, como había pedido Rolf Mützenich.
Una "congelación" significaría mantener el status quo actual, es
decir, conservar las zonas ocupadas por el ejército ruso. Klingbeil: No hay
duda de qué lado está el SPD. Klingbeil rechazó tajantemente la acusación de
que los socialdemócratas negarían apoyo al país en él mismo en la guerra
defensiva: "
     <u>
      Nada de lo que dice Rolf Mützenich y lo que defiende el SPD
sugiere que nosotros decidamos sobre la mentalidad de los ucraniano
     </u>
     s",
continuó Klingbeil. En Ucrania no hay duda de qué lado está el SPD, como lo
demuestran los suministros de armas y el apoyo financiero hasta la fecha.
Klingbeil explicó el poder de la Canciller en materia de entregas de
"Taurus": "
     <u>
      Al final, Olaf Scholz es responsable de ellos
políticamente decisión." Si la Canciller decide que la entrega del
"Taurus" representaría un peligro demasiado grande para la República
Federal,
     </u>
     entonces tendremos que aceptarlo. "Creo que esta decisión
debe ser tratada con respeto".

    BRUSELAS taz | Las guerras en Ucrania y Gaza mantienen en
vilo a la Unión Europea. En Bruselas, los 27 jefes de Estado y de Gobierno de
la UE rompieron dos importantes tabúes de política exterior. Los líderes de la
UE se pronunciaron por primera vez a favor de un alto el fuego en la Franja de
Gaza.
    <span lang="EN-US" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">
     En un comunicado,
pidieron "una pausa humanitaria inmediata que conduzca a un alto el fuego
permanente, la liberación incondicional de todos los rehenes y la prestación de
asistencia humanitaria".

    La
reticencia que antes se practicaba hacia Israel es ahora cosa del pasado. La
posición de la UE está en gran medida en línea con la nueva postura de Estados
Unidos, dijo el primer ministro belga, Alexander De Croo, quien actualmente
ocupa la presidencia de la UE. Washington también se ha alejado recientemente de

    También
hubo un punto de inflexión en la disputa sobre la financiación de la ayuda
armamentista a Ucrania. Los jefes de Estado y de Gobierno han pedido a la
Comisión de la UE que desarrolle un plan sobre cómo se pueden utilizar los
ingresos por intereses de los activos rusos congelados para comprar armas.
Hasta ahora, los activos extranjeros se consideraban sacrosantos. El Banco
Central Europeo había advertido sobre turbulencias si la UE accedía al dinero
del banco central ruso. Ahora es sólo una cuestión de interés. Los primeros mil
millones podrían fluir antes del 1 de julio, dijo la presidenta de la Comisión,
Ursula von der Leyen.

  Έχουμε μπει πια στον έκτο μήνα της γενοκτονικής σφαγής του σιωνιστικού κράτους του Ισραήλ ενάντια στον λαό της Παλαιστίνης στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Οι ασταμάτητοι καθημερινοί βομβαρδισμοί μετατρέπουν την περιοχή σε ερείπια γεμάτα από δολοφονημένους αμάχους, ενώ εγκρίθηκε από το πολεμικό συμβούλιο του Ισραήλ και η εισβολή στη Ράφα. Ταυτόχρονα, το Ισραήλ χρησιμοποιεί την πείνα σαν όπλο ενάντια στον παλαιστινιακό λαό, αλλά και όπως επισημαίνουν αρκετοί αναλυτές, σαν εργαλείο πίεσης στις διαπραγματεύσεις με τη Χαμάς. Στην ίδια κατεύθυνση -της πίεσης- χρησιμοποιούν οι σιωνιστές και την απειλή της εισβολής στη Ράφα, που πάντως απηχεί συνάμα και τη βούληση της ακραίας αντιδραστικής ομάδας σιωνιστών που κυβερνά το Ισραήλ και που έχει ενσωματώσει στις πολιτικές της τις πρακτικές των Γερμανών Ναζί.
 </p>
<p>
  Μάξιμουμ στόχος των σιωνιστών, η χρησιμοποίηση της γενοκτονικής πολιτικής σαν μέσο για τον μαζικό εκτοπισμό των Παλαιστινίων από τη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Αυτός ο στόχος, παρά τα δεινά του παλαιστινιακού λαού, δεν είναι καθόλου εύκολα επιτεύξιμος, όχι κυρίως γιατί βρίσκει τα αντιδραστικά αραβικά καθεστώτα απέναντι για να «μην φορτωθούν το πρόβλημα». Αλλά γιατί ο λαός της Γάζας αρνείται επίμονα και με γενναιότητα να εγκαταλείψει τον τόπο που ζει και να γίνει για δεύτερη φορά πρόσφυγας.
 </p>
<p>
  Μίνιμουμ στόχος, η δημιουργία προϋποθέσεων για κατατεμαχισμό της Λωρίδας της Γάζας σε στρατιωτικά επιτηρούμενες περιοχές στα πρότυπα των γκέτο που έχουν δημιουργήσει στη Δυτική Όχθη (που με τη σειρά τους είναι μια, εξελιγμένη και αναβαθμισμένη σε βαρβαρότητα, αντιγραφή των εβραϊκών γκέτο που έφτιαξαν οι ναζί). Θεωρούν ότι έτσι θα μπορέσουν να υλοποιήσουν μια έστω πιο αργόσυρτη διαδικασία εκτοπισμού του παλαιστινιακού λαού από τη γη του. Άλλωστε, αυτή η διαδικασία συμβαίνει σε ενεστώτα χρόνο στην, κομματιασμένη σε ασφυκτικά επιτηρούμενες περιοχές από τις προδοτικές συμφωνίες του Όσλο, Δυτική Όχθη. Για του λόγου το αληθές, ο ρυθμός δημιουργίας νέων σπιτιών εποίκων στην παλαιστινιακή γη έχει εκτοξευθεί          : από τον Οκτώβριο του 2022 έως τον Οκτώβριο του 2023, καταγράφηκαν 24.500 νέες οικιστικές μονάδες εποίκων. Παράλληλα, φαίνεται πως για παν ενδεχόμενο οι σιωνιστές έχουν προσεγγίσει φατρίες μέσα στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας, για να διαμορφώσουν, όπως πριν το 2005, ένα δίκτυο δωσίλογων, μέσω των οποίων να εμπεδώνουν την ισραηλινή κατοχή στην περιοχή.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   ΗΠΑ: εμπλοκή και στοχεύσεις
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Ο υπότιτλος δεν αναφέρεται στην εμπλοκή των ΗΠΑ στη σφαγή που εξελίσσεται μέσω της συνεχιζόμενης και μαζικής τροφοδοσίας με κάθε φονικό σιδερικό προς το σιωνιστικό Ισραήλ. Αυτή συνεχίζεται και θα συνεχιστεί και μάλλον αποτελούν μοχλό πίεσης οι φήμες πως ενδέχεται οι ΗΠΑ να σταματήσουν τη στρατιωτική βοήθεια προς το Τελ Αβίβ.
 </p>
<p>
  Ο αμερικανικός ιμπεριαλισμός, βλέποντας να διακυβεύονται τα στρατηγικά του συμφέροντα στη Μέση Ανατολή από την πολιτική Νετανιάχου, παράλληλα με τη στήριξη που παρέχει στους σιωνιστές, έχει το τελευταίο διάστημα εμπλακεί εντείνοντας ξανά την πίεση και τους εκβιασμούς στη σιωνιστική ηγεσία. Μετά τις αλλεπάλληλες δηλώσεις ή «διαρροές» με ανοιχτά μικρόφωνα του Μπάιντεν και του Μπλίνκεν, ήρθε ο επικεφαλής των Δημοκρατικών και πρόεδρος της αμερικανικής Γερουσίας, Τζακ Σούμερ, να δηλώσει πως το Ισραήλ πρέπει να πάει σε εκλογές και να αντικατασταθεί ο Νετανιάχου, μιας και αποτελεί εμπόδιο για την ειρήνη. Ο ίδιος ο Σούμερ, όπως και συνολικά η αμερικανική κυβέρνηση, απαίτησαν παράλληλα μια «νέα» Παλαιστινιακή Αρχή. Μάλιστα, ο ανεκδιήγητος Μαχμούντ Αμπάς έσπευσε αμέσως να υπακούσει στις αμερικανικές προσταγές, αλλάζοντας τον πρωθυπουργό της ΠΑ με έναν γνωστό για τις διασυνδέσεις του με τις ΗΠΑ και πρώην στέλεχος της Παγκόσμιας Τράπεζας. Γι’ αυτό και πολύ σωστά, σημαντικές παλαιστινιακές οργανώσεις (Χαμάς, ισλαμική Τζιχάντ, Λαϊκό Μέτωπο για την Απελευθέρωση της Παλαιστίνης, Κίνημα Εθνικής Πρωτοβουλίας) κατήγγειλαν απερίφραστα «τα νέα προδοτικά κόλπα» του Αμπάς, την στιγμή που «
  <em>
   η ύψιστη εθνική προτεραιότητα τώρα είναι η αντιμετώπιση της βάρβαρης σιωνιστικής επιθετικότητας και του γενοκτονικού και λιμοκτονικού πολέμου της Κατοχής ενάντια στον λαό μας στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας και η αντιμετώπιση των εγκλημάτων των εποίκων της στη Δυτική Όχθη και την υπό κατοχή Αλ-Κουντς (σ.σ. Ιερουσαλήμ) -ιδιαίτερα στο Τέμενος Αλ-Ακσα- και των σημαντικών κινδύνων που αντιμετωπίζει η εθνική μας υπόθεση -στην πρώτη γραμμή των οποίων βρίσκεται ο εξελισσόμενος κίνδυνος του εκτοπισμού
  </em>
  ».
 </p>
<p>
  Οι Αμερικάνοι φαίνεται ότι θα ήθελαν με μια διπλή αντικατάσταση (κυβέρνησης Ισραήλ, Παλαιστινιακής Αρχής) να αναστήσουν το σχέδιο ενός κράτους Μπαντουστάν για τους Παλαιστίνιους, προτεκτοράτο του Ισραήλ, των αραβικών καθεστώτων και φυσικά δικό τους και σε δεύτερο χρόνο να ανοίξουν τον δρόμο για την επαναφορά σε πρώτο πλάνο της προσέγγισης Ισραήλ-Αραβικών καθεστώτων, με στόχο το Ιράν και στο βάθος τη Ρωσία και την Κίνα.
 </p>
<p>
  Επιπλέον, αδίστακτοι καθώς είναι, χρησιμοποιούν και την «ανθρωπιστική βοήθεια» για να αποκτήσουν μεταφορικά και κυριολεκτικά άμεση πρόσβαση στη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Με την ελληνοκυπριακή ηγεσία, διπλά δουλική σε ΗΠΑ και Ισραήλ και ακολουθώντας πιστά την άρχουσα τάξη της χώρας μας, να έχει μετατρέψει την Κύπρο σε ξέφραγο αμπέλι των σιωνιστών και ταυτόχρονα να βάζει πλάτη στους αμερικανικούς σχεδιασμούς για την παρουσία τους στην περιοχή. Ας σημειώσουμε εδώ ότι μέσω της επιχείρησης «Αμάλθειας» μεταφέρθηκαν στη Λωρίδα μόλις 200 τόνοι τρόφιμα, όσα δηλαδή μπορούν να μεταφέρουν 10 φορτηγά από την ξηρά, την ίδια στιγμή που το Ισραήλ αρνείται την είσοδο στη Λωρίδα εκατοντάδων φορτηγών από το πέρασμα της Ράφα.
 </p>
<p>
  Ταυτόχρονα και παράλληλα με τα προηγούμενα, οι ΗΠΑ πιέζουν ασφυκτικά τη σιωνιστική ηγεσία να γυρίσει στο τραπέζι των διαπραγματεύσεων, μιας και είναι αυτή που συνεχώς τις τορπιλίζει. Έτσι, η πίεση των ΗΠΑ αλλά και οι σοβαρές αντιθέσεις στο εσωτερικό του πολεμικού συμβουλίου και της σιωνιστικής κυβέρνησης, λόγω του βαλτώματος της στρατιωτικής εισβολής, είχαν σαν αποτέλεσμα η σιωνιστική διαπραγματευτική ομάδα να γυρίσει στην Ντόχα την περασμένη Τρίτη 19/3. Όσον αφορά τις διαπραγματεύσεις, η πλευρά της Χαμάς, που βρίσκεται σε συνεννόηση με όλες τις αντιστασιακές παλαιστινιακές οργανώσεις, αρνείται, και σωστά, την απελευθέρωση όλων των ομήρων, διότι αυτό απλά θα σήμαινε την αποθράσυνση των σιωνιστών. Από την πλευρά της, και σωστά, θέτει ως βασικό (και ίσως μάξιμουμ) όρο την επίτευξη μιας μόνιμης κατάπαυσης του πυρός, την αποχώρηση των στρατευμάτων κατοχής από τη Λωρίδα και από κει και πέρα την ελευθερία στον λαό της Λωρίδας να γυρίσει στον τόπο του και φυσικά την έναρξη μια διαδικασίας αποκατάστασης όλων των υποδομών και τελικά της ζωής στην πολύπαθη και ματωμένη Λωρίδα της Γάζας. Το πώς ακριβώς θα προχωρήσουν οι εξελίξεις μένει να το δούμε.

Έτσι και εδώ, ο εγχώριος αστισμός ετοιμάζεται να φορέσει τα «δημοκρατικά» του κουστούμια, την ίδια ώρα που κάνει σχέδια για να ντύσει τον κόσμο της δουλειάς και τη νεολαία στις παραλλαγές, όποτε αυτό απαιτηθεί.
 </p>
<p>
  Γιατί εκεί ακριβώς οδηγεί η αναβάθμιση της εμπλοκής της χώρας στις εστίες αντιπαράθεσης που έχει ανάψει η παρόξυνση του ιμπεριαλιστικού ανταγωνισμού των ΗΠΑ-Δύσης με τη Ρωσία, αλλά και την Κίνα! Η συνάντηση του Μητσοτάκη με τον Ζελένσκι στην Οδησσό, κατά παραγγελία των Αμερικάνων και σε αναζήτηση ρόλων για λογαριασμό της ντόπιας άρχουσας τάξης σε πεδία που ήδη έχει κατοχυρώσει συμμετοχή η ανταγωνίστρια τουρκική, σημαδεύτηκε από τη «συμπτωματική» ρωσική πυραυλική επιδρομή μερικές εκατοντάδες μέτρα πιο δίπλα. Και οι προειδοποιητικές αναφορές του ρωσικού υπουργείου Εξωτερικών προς την Ελλάδα, που ακολούθησαν, αποτέλεσαν μια υπενθύμιση για το μέγεθος των κινδύνων που προκύπτουν από το γεγονός ότι η χώρα μετατρέπεται σε εν δυνάμει «στόχο» στο πλαίσιο της ενδοϊμπεριαλιστικής διαπάλης. Το ίδιο ισχύει και σε σχέση με την όλο και βαθύτερη ένταξη στο μέτωπο της Μέσης Ανατολής, με τη φρεγάτα «Ύδρα» να αναλαμβάνει ενεργό στρατιωτικό ρόλο στην Ερυθρά Θάλασσα στο πλαίσιο της «ευρωπαϊκής» αποστολής Aspides, κόντρα στα drones των Χούθι και προς στήριξη της σιωνιστικής γενοκτονίας του παλαιστινιακού λαού.
 </p>
<p>
  «Ευρωπαϊκής» και όχι γνήσια ευρωπαϊκής, μιας και είναι γνωστό το πόσο διχασμένη εμφανίστηκε η ΕΕ μπροστά στην πρωτοβουλία του αμερικάνικου ιμπεριαλισμού να ενισχύσει τη στρατιωτική του παρουσία στην Ερυθρά Θάλασσα με την επιχείρηση Prosperity Guardian. Αυτός ο διχασμός καταγράφηκε και στην πρόσφατη σύνοδο κορυφής, που επί της ουσίας είχε ως βασικό αντικείμενο το πώς θα σταθούν οι Ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές σε μια σειρά από μέτωπα, δεδομένης της αδυναμίας τους να κινηθούν ανεξάρτητα από τους συμμάχους-ανταγωνιστές τους στις ΗΠΑ, αλλά και των κενών και αντιφάσεων που έχει παρουσιάσει το τελευταίο διάστημα η πολιτική των τελευταίων. Έτσι, για άλλη μια φορά, όπως αποτυπώθηκε στην αντιπαράθεση Γαλλίας-Γερμανίας για την πρόταση έκδοσης ευρωομολόγου της τελευταίας, με την οποία έσπευσε να συνταχθεί και ο Μητσοτάκης, τα φιλόδοξα στρατιωτικά και εξοπλιστικά σχέδια για «στρατηγική αυτονομία» της ΕΕ είναι πολύ αμφίβολο αν θα υπερβούν τις ιδιοτελείς φιλοδοξίες της κάθε ιμπεριαλιστικής δύναμης για τον εαυτό της! Το μόνο σίγουρο είναι ότι στη συζήτηση που έχει ανοίξει για τους «τρόπους χρηματοδότησης» των διαφόρων πολεμικών προγραμμάτων, στο στόχαστρο βρίσκονται τα συνήθη υποζύγια των λαών της Ευρώπης, και ιδιαίτερα των εξαρτημένων χωρών, που θα κληθούν να πληρώσουν το μάρμαρο.
 </p>
<p>
  Εξακολουθώντας να παραδέρνει στις αντιθέσεις και τα εγγενή αδιέξοδά του, επομένως, το ευρωπαϊκό ιμπεριαλιστικό οικοδόμημα βαδίζει προς την κάλπη για την ανάδειξη του διακοσμητικού του οργάνου, για να φτιασιδώσει ό,τι μπορεί από το αποκρουστικό του πρόσωπο, που έχει αποκαλυφθεί πλατιά. Με πύρινους λόγους για τη «δημοκρατία» και τη «συμμετοχή» ετοιμάζονται να εμφανιστούν οι ηγέτες των ιμπεριαλιστικών μητροπόλεων, που πριν από λίγο καιρό κατέβαζαν τον στρατό στους δρόμους ενάντια στις εξεγέρσεις των λαών τους και ποινικοποιούσαν κάθε έκφραση αλληλεγγύης προς τον ηρωικό παλαιστινιακό λαό. Οι πρωταγωνιστές των αντικομμουνιστικών μνημονίων και της εξίσωσης κομμουνισμού-ναζισμού, που θρέφουν ξανά τα πιο μαύρα σκοτάδια του παρελθόντος της ανθρώπινης ιστορίας, που έχουν κανονικοποιήσει τον φασισμό και τον πόλεμο στην καθημερινότητα των λαών τους, ετοιμάζονται να μιλήσουν για το «μέλλον». Κατά πόδας τους ακολουθούν και οι πολιτικοί εκπρόσωποι της ντόπιας κεφαλαιοκρατίας.
 </p>
<p>
  Τόσο η κυβέρνηση της ΝΔ όσο και τα υπόλοιπα αστικά κόμματα της αντιπολίτευσης, λοιπόν, παίρνουν θέσεις ενόψει των ευρωεκλογών. Δεν θα μπορούσε να γίνει διαφορετικά, μιας και πέρα από την ανάγκη ενσωμάτωσης του λαού στα ιμπεριαλιστικά ευρωπαϊκά ιδεώδη που καλούνται διαχρονικά να υπηρετήσουν, αντιλαμβάνονται, επίσης, ότι οφείλουν και τα ίδια να αποδείξουν την προσήλωσή τους και να δώσουν κάθε λογής διαπιστευτήρια στους Ευρωπαίους «προστάτες» τους, σε μια εποχή, μάλιστα, μεγάλης γεωπολιτικής αναταραχής και έντονων ανισορροπιών στις σχέσεις των τελευταίων με τον έτερο υπερατλαντικό πυλώνα του καθεστώτος της εξάρτησης της χώρας, τους Αμερικάνους ιμπεριαλιστές.
 </p>
<p>
  Τα αδιέξοδα που παράγονται από αυτή την κατάσταση, άλλωστε, είναι που εισπράττει η κυβέρνηση της ΝΔ, η οποία έχει εμφανίσει σοβαρά σημάδια κάμψης, παρά τη σαφή δημοσκοπική της υπεροχή έναντι των υπολοίπων. Έτσι, μετά το καταδικαστικό ψήφισμα του ευρωκοινοβουλίου, ήρθαν οι αποκαλύψεις για το σκάνδαλο Ασημακοπούλου με τις επακόλουθες καρατομήσεις κυβερνητικών στελεχών, καθώς και οι παρεμβάσεις της ευρωπαϊκής εισαγγελίας για τα Τέμπη. Από αυτή την άποψη μπορεί και να εξηγηθεί το πόσο «ευρύχωρη» θέλει να εμφανίζεται ξαφνικά η ευρωβουλή και οι επιτροπές της για μια σειρά από κοινωνικές διεκδικήσεις, είτε αυτές αφορούν την απαίτηση των συγγενών των θυμάτων του εγκλήματος στα Τέμπη για απόδοση δικαιοσύνης είτε τα αιτήματα των κατοίκων των Εξαρχείων ενάντια στην καταστροφή της γειτονιάς τους. Δεν είναι μόνο οι τόνοι υποκρισίας που από πάντα κουβαλούν τα δήθεν ευαίσθητα στελέχη των Βρυξελλών και του Στρασβούργου! Είναι η σημερινή φάση που θέτει ως αναγκαιότητα στους Ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές ξανά και ξανά να αμφισβητήσουν την επιλογή της ντόπιας άρχουσας τάξης να αποτελεί το πιο πιστό και καλό παιδί των Αμερικάνων στην περιοχή.
 </p>
<p>
  Γι’ αυτό, όσο συγκλονιστικό είναι το μεγαλείο ενός γονιού που έχει χάσει το παιδί του και αγωνίζεται για δικαίωση, τόσο ασυγχώρητη είναι η άθλια αξιοποίησή του στο πλαίσιο των ιμπεριαλιστικών αντιθέσεων ή της ανάγκης των ευρωπαϊκών αφεντικών να συνετίσουν τους υποτελείς τους! Ακόμα περισσότερο, είναι ολέθριες για την εργατική τάξη, τον λαό και τη νεολαία οι αυταπάτες που καλλιεργούνται το τελευταίο διάστημα από την αστική αντιπολίτευση του ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, του ΠΑΣΟΚ, της Νέας Αριστεράς και άλλων, αλλά και από δυνάμεις της ποικιλώνυμης αριστεράς, ότι η ΕΕ και το κοινοβούλιό της είναι περίπου ο «φύλακας άγγελος» των λαϊκών δικαιωμάτων, ότι θα τιμωρήσουμε την «κακιά» κυβέρνηση Μητσοτάκη απευθυνόμενοι στους «καλούς» Ευρωπαίους που μας προστατεύουν.
 </p>
<p>
  Φυσικά, άλλο που δεν θέλει η αριστερά της ήττας και της υποταγής! Με χαρακτηριστική την περίπτωση του ΚΚΕ, που σπεύδει να κλείσει τον αγώνα της νεολαίας για να φορέσει τις εκλογικές του γραβάτες, με το που τελείωσαν οι τοπικές εκλογές έστρεψε κατευθείαν το βλέμμα της εκεί και όλη της η δράση περιστρέφεται εδώ και μήνες γύρω από τη «μητέρα των μαχών». Κάποιες οργανώσεις έφτασαν, μάλιστα, να καταρτίζουν ευρωψηφοδέλτια εν μέσω φοιτητικού ξεσηκωμού! Όλοι τους, μπροστά στην εκλογική παραζάλη και τις αυταπάτες, τρέχουν για άλλη μια φορά να δώσουν τη νομιμοποίησή τους στην κάλπη της ιμπεριαλιστικής λυκοσυμμαχίας και να συνδράμουν στον αγώνα των κυρίαρχων ενάντια στην «επάρατη» αποχή!
 </p>
<p>
  Γιατί οι δυνάμεις του συστήματος της εξάρτησης και της εκμετάλλευσης γνωρίζουν πολύ καλά ότι στη σημερινή φάση βαδίζουν στο πυρακτωμένο έδαφος της κοινωνικής οργής και αγανάκτησης που ολοένα και διευρύνεται και επιδρά πολλαπλασιαστικά στους ήδη υπάρχοντες όρους αστάθειας του αστικού πολιτικού σκηνικού. Έτσι, στους τριγμούς που παράγει η γεωπολιτική θέση της αστικής «μας» τάξης, αλλά και, σε συνάρτηση με το προηγούμενο, στους κραδασμούς μια παραπαίουσας παραρτηματοποιημένης οικονομίας, που στέκεται αδύναμη μπροστά σε «εξωγενείς απειλές», σύμφωνα με πρόσφατη έκθεση της JP Morgan, θα προστίθενται διαρκώς τα δεδομένα που θα διαμορφώνει η οργή των «από κάτω».
 </p>
<p>
  Η μαζική αποδοκιμασία του πορίσματος συγκάλυψης της εξεταστικής επιτροπής για τα Τέμπη αυτό ακριβώς αποτυπώνει. Με τη φτώχεια και την εξαθλίωση να απλώνονται, με την καπιταλιστική ακρίβεια να έχει γονατίσει την κοινωνική πλειονότητα, με την κυβέρνηση να ανακοινώνει το τέλος των διαφόρων επιδομάτων και pass και την υποταγή στη «δημοσιονομική σταθερότητα», με τον λαό να εξορίζεται από τα νοσοκομεία και κάθε δυνατότητα πρόσβασης σε υγειονομική περίθαλψη, με την πολυαναμενόμενη αύξηση του κατώτατου μισθού να αποδεικνύεται κοροϊδία που ήδη έχει εξανεμιστεί, είναι σαφές ότι διαμορφώνονται κύματα δυσαρέσκειας στις λαϊκές μάζες, που κάθε άλλο παρά μπορούν να ελεγχθούν, όσο και αν πασχίζουν άπαντες να τα εγκλωβίσουν στην κάλπη και σε ανώδυνες ή και επικίνδυνες λύσεις.
 </p>
<p>
  Η βαναυσότητα των δυνάμεων καταστολής απέναντι στους φοιτητές που επιμένουν να κάνουν καταλήψεις ενάντια στον ψηφισμένο νόμο Πιερρακάκη, οι απειλές για φυλάκιση ενάντια στους «ατίθασους» εκπαιδευτικούς που αρνούνται την αξιολόγηση, αποδεικνύει ότι οι ιθύνοντες όλο και πιο συχνά θα καταφεύγουν «στον νόμο και την τάξη» για να ανακόψουν τις κοινωνικές διεργασίες που εξελίσσονται, γιατί πολύ απλά δεν έχουν άλλη επιλογή. «Μπροστά στον νόμο δεν επιτρέπεται ο δρόμος» είναι το μήνυμα που επιδιώκουν να στείλουν, γιατί αυτή η διέξοδος είναι που φοβούνται!
 </p>
<p>
  Αυτή τη διέξοδο οφείλουμε να ενισχύσουμε! Με συσπείρωση των δυνάμεων και των αγωνιστών που επιμένουν ότι τίποτα δεν τελείωσε, πως ο αγώνας για την ανατροπή του νόμου Πιερρακάκη πρέπει να συνεχιστεί, πως είναι υπαρκτή δυνατότητα το κοινό μέτωπο εργαζομένων και νεολαίας. Με τη συμπόρευση των τάσεων εκείνων που αρνούνται να παρέχουν νομιμοποίηση στο άθλιο κατασκεύασμα της ευρωκάλπης των ιμπεριαλιστών, βροντοφωνάζοντας παντού την επιλογή της ΑΠΟΧΗΣ από την εκλογική φάρσα, δείχνοντας τον δρόμο της πάλης των μαζών ενάντια στα δεσμά της ΕΕ και του ΝΑΤΟ. Για να υπηρετήσουμε, σε τελευταία ανάλυση, την προοπτική της αναμέτρησης της εργατικής τάξης, του λαού και της νεολαίας με το καθεστώς της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης, την προοπτική της επαναστατικής ανατροπής της εκμετάλλευσης και της κοινωνικής απελευθέρωσης!

<p>
  Μετά την ολοκλήρωση των εργασιών της Εξεταστικής Επιτροπής της Βουλής για το έγκλημα των Τεμπών, με βάση τη δημοσιότητα που είχε πάρει το ζήτημα των υπογραφών και με πρόσφατη τη μαύρη πρώτη επέτειο και την οργή του κόσμου που εκφράστηκε μαζικά στην απεργία στις 28 Φλεβάρη, το κλίμα βάραινε για την κυβέρνηση και δυσχέραινε την επιχείρηση συγκάλυψης.
 </p>
<p>
  Η κυβέρνηση, όπως ήταν αναμενόμενο, πέρασε στην αντεπίθεση και κινήθηκε σε δυο βασικούς άξονες: Πρώτον κατηγόρησε την αντιπολίτευση ότι εργαλειοποιεί την τραγωδία και χρησιμοποιεί τους νεκρούς και τον πόνο των συγγενών τους στην πολιτική της αντιπαράθεση με αυτήν (πολιτικές βδέλλες, τους χαρακτήρισε ο κυβερνητικός εκπρόσωπος Μαρινάκης). Και δεύτερον, παρουσιάστηκε ως η μόνη υπεύθυνη που θα μπορούσε πραγματικά να ικανοποιήσει το αίτημα των συγγενών, αλλά και όλου του λαού, για πλήρη διαλεύκανση της υπόθεσης και τιμωρία των ενόχων με πραγματικά και αντικειμενικά στοιχεία.
 </p>
<p>
  Σε αυτές τις κατευθύνσεις κινήθηκε και ο ίδιος ο Μητσοτάκης στη συνέντευξή του στον ΣΚΑΪ. Παίρνοντας το γνωστό, προφανώς πολυδουλεμένο από το επικοινωνιακό επιτελείο του «ανθρώπινο» ύφος, είπε πως δεν ξέχασε τις εικόνες και τις μυρωδιές την άλλη μέρα, όταν πήγε στον τόπο του εγκλήματος, του οποίου το μπάζωμα επέβαλε η ανθρώπινη ανάγκη να στηριχθούν κάπου οι γερανοί για να σηκώσουν τα βαγόνια και να ανασυρθούν τα πτώματα. Η ανθρωπιά του εξαντλήθηκε κάπου εκεί, γιατί ήταν πολύ κυνικός όταν έλεγε ότι ο σιδηρόδρομος είναι όσο ασφαλής μπορεί να είναι, χωρίς να αποκλείει, στην πραγματικότητα, κι άλλους νεκρούς στο μέλλον…
 </p>
<p>
  Τις ίδιες κατευθύνσεις ακολούθησε, με σχετικά επιθετικούς τόνους, η κυβέρνηση στη συζήτηση στη Βουλή για το πόρισμα της Εξεταστικής, δηλαδή της ΝΔ! Ένα πόρισμα που δεν βρήκε άλλο υπεύθυνο παρά τον ανθρώπινο παράγοντα και …την κακιά την ώρα που τα ‘φερε και έγιναν απανωτά λάθη και παραλείψεις που οδήγησαν στη σύγκρουση.
 </p>
<p>
  Στην πραγματικότητα, η ΝΔ απευθύνθηκε σε όλο τον λαό. Γνωρίζει ότι το έγκλημα των Τεμπών έχει προκαλέσει την οργή του, η οποία έχει εκφραστεί επανειλημμένα στον δρόμο, σε πολύ μαζικές συγκεντρώσεις, αλλά ακόμα και στο ενάμισι εκατομμύριο υπογραφές, παρά τις ενστάσεις που έχουμε γι΄ αυτές.
 </p>
<p>
  Αυτό που την ανησυχεί, πολύ περισσότερο απ’ ό,τι θέλει να δείχνει, είναι ότι αυτή η οργή του κόσμου συσσωρεύεται και αφορά σχεδόν όλες τις πλευρές της ζωής του. Κάποιο απ’ όλα τα ζητήματα που ανοίγει καθημερινά η επίθεσή της στα δικαιώματα λαού και νεολαίας μπορεί να γίνει η σταγόνα που θα κάνει το ποτήρι να ξεχειλίσει, με απρόβλεπτες συνέπειες.
 </p>
<p>
  Έτσι, στο ζήτημα των Τεμπών θέλει να πετύχει δυο αντικρουόμενους στόχους: Να συγκαλύψει το έγκλημα, να απαλλάξει τους υπουργούς της, αλλά και την ίδια, από πολιτικές ευθύνες και να κατευνάσει την οργή και των συγγενών και του λαού. Και την πίτα ολάκερη και τον σκύλο χορτάτο, δηλαδή, κάτι που αν έχει ελπίδες να καταφέρει είναι μόνο λόγω της κυριαρχίας της στο αστικό πολιτικό σκηνικό και, κυρίως, λόγω της απουσίας ενός λαϊκού κινήματος τόσο μαζικού, διεκδικητικού και ανυποχώρητου που θα την αναγκάσει να κάνει πίσω.
 </p>
<p>
  Στη συζήτηση στη Βουλή, αυτή η υπεροχή της ήταν φανερή, όχι μόνο γιατί τόλμησε και πέρασε στην αντεπίθεση, αλλά και γιατί το «
  <em>
   Πυρ ομαδόν
  </em>
  » εναντίον της, που γράφτηκε στον τύπο, μάλλον δεν την άγγιξε καν. ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, ΠΑΣΟΚ, Νέα Αριστερά αλλά και Πλεύση Ελευθερίας βρέθηκαν πολύ μακριά από το να εκφράσουν το λαϊκό αίσθημα για τη συγκάλυψη. Και πώς θα μπορούσαν άλλωστε, τη στιγμή που όλοι έχουν να λογοδοτήσουν για όσα έκαναν ή δεν έκαναν όταν βρέθηκαν σε κυβερνητικές θέσεις, προετοιμάζοντας τον δρόμο που οδήγησε στο έγκλημα.
 </p>
<p>
  Όσο για το ΚΚΕ, υπερασπίστηκε την πρότασή του για τη συγκρότηση της Εξεταστικής Επιτροπής, η οποία υλοποιήθηκε, λέγοντας πως δεν είχε αυταπάτες γιατί γνώριζε τα όριά της, αλλά την αποτίμησε θετικά γιατί αποκαλύφθηκε η προσπάθεια συγκάλυψης, ήρθαν στο φως νέα στοιχεία, αλλά και τροφοδοτήθηκαν οι κινητοποιήσεις λαού και νεολαίας! Αν δεν ήταν η Εξεταστική θα είχε λιγότερο κόσμο η απεργία και οι συγκεντρώσεις στις 28 Φλεβάρη δηλαδή; Ξεδιάντροπη διαστρέβλωση της πραγματικότητας, με στόχους που δεν είναι της παρούσης…
 </p>
<p>
  Ωστόσο, πιέσεις ασκούνται στην κυβέρνηση από την πλευρά της ΕΕ, μετά την παρέμβαση της Ευρωπαϊκής Εισαγγελίας και της αμφισβήτησης της βουλευτικής ασυλίας και του νόμου περί ευθύνης υπουργών, η οποία άνοιξε και όλη τη συζήτηση για το αν η ευρωπαϊκή νομοθεσία υπερισχύει του σχετικού άρθρου 86 του Συντάγματος. Επίσης, μετά τις ομιλίες της Καρυστιανού στο Ευρωκοινοβούλιο, αποφασίστηκε να παραμείνουν σε λειτουργία οι αρμόδιες επιτροπές της ΕΕ για τον έλεγχο της δικαστικής διαδικασίας, η οποία, πάντως, προχωρά πολύ γρήγορα, για τα ελληνικά δεδομένα.
 </p>
<p>
  Το ερώτημα είναι προς τα πού. Οι πιέσεις από την ΕΕ δεν έχουν την …αγνή πρόθεση της απονομής δικαιοσύνης σε ένα κράτος-μέλος της που σε αυτόν τον τομέα πάσχει. Αλλά είναι κινήσεις στην πολιτική-γεωπολιτική σκακιέρα, με στόχο ένα κράτος-μέλος που όλο και περισσότερο προσδένεται στο άρμα του μεγάλου υπερατλαντικού συμμάχου και πάσχει στον τομέα της …αφοσίωσης στην Ένωση.
 </p>
<p>
  Σε κάθε περίπτωση, η πιο ουσιαστική πίεση που μπορεί να ασκηθεί στην κυβέρνηση είναι αυτή από τον λαό, μέσα από τις κινητοποιήσεις του. Γιατί όπως κάποια στιγμή είπε και η ίδια η Καρυστιανού, η δικαίωση θα είναι να μην ξανασυμβεί κάτι τέτοιο. Ό,τι κι αν σημαίνει αυτό, θα συμπληρώσουμε εμείς…

  Πριν από μερικές μέρες, καρκινοπαθής στο Ηράκλειο Κρήτης αυτοκτόνησε απ’ την απόγνωση που βίωνε στην προσπάθειά του να λάβει θεραπεία. Στο σημείωμα που άφησε αναφέρει ότι δεν μπορούσε ν’ αντέξει άλλο τους πόνους όσο περίμενε το φάρμακό του, που βρισκόταν σε έλλειψη. Οι συγγενείς του αποκάλυψαν και τη δίμηνη κόλαση απ’ τη μέρα της διάγνωσης, καθώς προσπαθούσε να βρει περίθαλψη. Να ολοκληρώσει τις διαγνωστικές εξετάσεις με δική του ευθύνη στον ιδιωτικό τομέα, να προγραμματίσει εξειδικευμένες εξετάσεις για τις οποίες θα έπρεπε να μεταβεί στην Αθήνα χωρίς να έχει την οικονομική δυνατότητα, ν’ αναζητήσει και να προμηθευτεί ο ίδιος το φάρμακό του και να κλείσει το ραντεβού στο νοσοκομείο για να γίνουν οι χημειοθεραπείες. Αποτέλεσμα αυτών η τουλάχιστον δίμηνη καθυστέρηση, με αποτέλεσμα τον διπλασιασμό του όγκου και τους αφόρητους πόνους. Απέναντι σ’ όλα αυτά, ο υπουργός Υγείας Γεωργιάδης βρήκε το πρόβλημα στην ατομική ευθύνη του ασθενή που δεν πήγε στο ραντεβού, το οποίο είχε αρχικά ακυρωθεί λόγω της έλλειψης του φαρμάκου.
 </p>
<p>
  Η περίπτωση του εκλιπόντος δεν είναι μοναδική. Τουναντίον, είναι η συνήθης και περιγράφει την κανονικότητα που υφίσταται ο λαός ως αποτέλεσμα της χρόνιας επίθεσης του συστήματος στο λαϊκό δικαίωμα σε ίση, πλήρη και δωρεάν περίθαλψη. Ο πρωθυπουργός Κυρ. Μητσοτάκης υπερηφανεύεται για την αναβάθμιση του ΕΣΥ διαφημίζοντας την απορρόφηση κονδυλίων απ’ το Ταμείο Ανάκαμψης για την ανακαίνιση κτιρίων, ενώ ο υπουργός Γεωργιάδης φωτογραφίζεται με τον πρώτο ασθενή που θα χειρουργηθεί σε απογευματινό επί πληρωμή χειρουργείο. Μάλιστα ο Γεωργιάδης υποστηρίζει ότι μόνο το 1% διαφωνεί με τα επί πληρωμή χειρουργεία και οι υπόλοιποι υγειονομικοί και λαός το περίμεναν εδώ και δεκαετίες!
 </p>
<p>
  Δεν πρόκειται για μία προσπάθεια μετατροπής του άσπρου σε μαύρο. Η πραγματικότητα είναι αμείλικτη κι ο λαός δεν μασάει κουτόχορτο. Γνωρίζουν ωστόσο τα όρια της πολιτικής υποταγής των συνδικαλιστικών ηγεσιών και των ρεφορμιστικών δυνάμεων και έχουν ζυγίσει την αντίδραση των «από κάτω». Γνωρίζουν φυσικά ότι δεν μπορεί να έχουν λαϊκή αποδοχή μια σειρά μέτρων που δυσχεραίνουν ακόμη περισσότερο τους εργασιακούς όρους των υγειονομικών και αναγκάζουν τον λαό να βάλει ακόμη πιο βαθιά το χέρι στην τσέπη για να βρει την υγειά του.
 </p>
<p>
  Τα απογευματινά χειρουργεία, που τράβηξαν και την περισσότερη δημοσιότητα, είναι μια σοβαρή παρέμβαση για μια σειρά από λόγους. Όσον αφορά τα εργασιακά δικαιώματα, σε συνδυασμό με την κατεύθυνση οι γιατροί του ΕΣΥ να εργάζονται και στον ιδιωτικό τομέα, η κυβέρνηση απαντά στους υγειονομικούς να δουλέψουν περισσότερο, μπροστά στην κλιμακούμενη ακρίβεια και τους καθηλωμένους μισθούς. Χτυπιέται ακόμη περισσότερο το δικαίωμα στη μόνιμη και σταθερή δουλειά και το δικαίωμα να μπορούμε να ζούμε από μία δουλειά με αξιοπρεπείς συνθήκες και μισθούς που να καλύπτουν το κόστος ζωής. Πέραν τούτου, είναι πραγματική κοροϊδία για τους υγειονομικούς, όπου ο μέσος εργαζόμενος έχει ωφελούμενα ρεπό και άδειες από δύο και τρία προηγούμενα έτη και παλεύουν για προσλήψεις ως μοναδική απάντηση στην εντατικοποίηση, να τους λέει η κυβέρνηση «δουλέψτε περισσότερο». Αυτήν ακριβώς την πραγματικότητα καταδεικνύουν κι οι παραιτήσεις αναισθησιολόγων απ’ το Βενιζέλειο Ηρακλείου λόγω της υπερεργασίας. Καθόλου δεν είδαν τα απογευματινά χειρουργεία σαν αναβάθμιση της εργασιακής τους κατάστασης, όπως ευαγγελίζεται ο Γεωργιάδης. Κρυφό σημείο, αλλά ιδιαίτερα σοβαρό, είναι η λεγόμενη δικλείδα ασφαλείας απ’ την κυβέρνηση, δηλαδή η προϋπόθεση να ολοκληρώνεται το πρωινό έργο. Ωστόσο αυτό θα καταμετράται ανά κλινική και όχι ανά γιατρό, δημιουργώντας νέες αντιθέσεις και ανταγωνισμούς μεταξύ των γιατρών και γιατρούς δύο ταχυτήτων. Πάντως το πόσο θα παραμείνει το συγκεκριμένο μέτρο μένει να το δούμε, μιας και έχει επιχειρηθεί ξανά εδώ και πολλές δεκαετίες. Η εικόνα προς το παρόν είναι η εφαρμογή του με πιεστικούς και εκβιαστικούς όρους απ’ την πλευρά του υπουργείου, χωρίς βέβαια κατά τόπους να λείπουν κι οι πρόθυμοι, χρήσιμοι ηλίθιοι.
 </p>
<p>
  Όσον αφορά το δικαίωμα του λαού στην περίθαλψη, το επιχείρημα ότι θα μειωθεί η λίστα των χειρουργείων είναι το λιγότερο φαιδρό. Τα χέρια είναι δεδομένα και τα όρια της ανθρώπινης αντοχής επίσης. Εξάλλου είναι καταμετρημένες απ’ την ΠΟΕΔΗΝ οι κλειστές χειρουργικές αίθουσες που δεν λειτουργούν ήδη το πρωινό ωράριο λόγω έλλειψης προσωπικού. Υπάρχει φυσικά κι η εμπειρία απ’ τα απογευματινά ιατρεία, που όχι μόνο δεν μείωσε την αναμονή για εξέταση αλλά την επιδείνωσε και υποβάθμισε και την ποιότητα παροχής υπηρεσιών. Ο τιμοκατάλογος που δημοσιεύθηκε δεν είναι καθόλου ευκαταφρόνητος για το λαϊκό εισόδημα, που μαστίζεται απ’ την ακρίβεια. Αυτό όμως που κατά βάση επιχειρεί η κυβέρνηση είναι η επέκταση του πεδίου -και μέσα στα νοσοκομεία- όπου καταργείται η έννοια της δωρεάν περίθαλψης. Η επέκταση της αντίληψης σε κάθε πτυχή της περίθαλψης ότι δεν είναι δικαίωμα αλλά εμπόρευμα προς εξαγορά. Έτσι ώστε να μετατρέπεται σε «φυσιολογική» η κατάσταση ο ασθενής να πληρώνει για το κάθε τι. Σ’ αυτό το πλαίσιο, το νομοσχέδιο που έφερε προς ψήφιση ο Γεωργιάδης φορτώνει ένα σωρό ακόμη κόστη στον λαό, σε διάφορες βαθμίδες της περίθαλψης.
 </p>
<p>
  Ο λαός θα πληρώνει νέο χαράτσι για τις διαγνωστικές εξετάσεις ανά παραπεμπτικό. Ένα ευρώ για τις εργαστηριακές και τρία για τις απεικονιστικές, με σκοπό την αποπληρωμή του clawback. Το clawback ουσιαστικά είναι χρήματα που δεν πληρώθηκαν γιατροί και διαγνωστικά κέντρα για εξετάσεις που ήδη διενεργήθηκαν με κάλυψη ΕΟΠΥΥ λόγω των δημοσιονομικών αναπροσαρμογών. Τα επιτυχή πλεονάσματα του Μητσοτάκη κατά επιταγή των ιμπεριαλιστών ληστεύουν την περίθαλψη του λαού.
 </p>
<p>
  Έχουν ήδη προηγηθεί οι αυξήσεις στα φάρμακα, με πληρωμή επιπλέον της εισφοράς ακόμη κι όταν ο ασφαλισμένος λαμβάνει το φθηνότερο γενόσημο (βλ. ΠΣ φ.957). Αυτή η, κατά την κυβέρνηση «μικρή», διαφορά ξεκοκαλίζει τη σύνταξη των ηλικιωμένων, που συνήθως λαμβάνουν περισσότερα του ενός φάρμακα. Ειδικά σε περιπτώσεις που δεν τίθεται καν η επιλογή φθηνότερου φαρμάκου, μιας κι οι ελλείψεις έχουν γίνει κανονικότητα μετά την άρση απαγόρευσης εξαγωγών και τα φαρμακεία προμηθεύονται τα φάρμακα απ’ τις αποθήκες με το σταγονόμετρο. Στο πλάι αυτών, θεσπίζεται κι η πληρωμή πέντε ευρώ για τη διενέργεια του εμβολίου για τον COVID19 στα φαρμακεία.
 </p>
<p>
  Τέλος, αλλά σίγουρα όχι τελειωτικά μιας κι η ίδια πολιτική θα συνεχίσει όσο δεν συγκροτούνται ικανές λαϊκές αντιστάσεις, επί πληρωμή θα είναι και ο προσωπικός ιατρός. Ο προσωπικός γιατρός δηλωμένα έρχεται ν’ αποτελέσει φραγμό στην πρόσβαση των ασθενών στα νοσοκομεία. Μαζί με τον ηλεκτρονικό φάκελο ασθενή, η κυβέρνηση προσπαθεί να στεγανοποιήσει το περιβάλλον του ΕΣΥ, ώστε ν’ αναβαθμίσει τη δυνατότητά του να περιορίσει την πρόσβαση και να διευρύνει τις χρεώσεις. Σκόνταψε και στα δύο στην απροθυμία συμμετοχής των γιατρών, λόγω χαμηλών απολαβών και εντατικοποίησης. Ο ηλεκτρονικός φάκελος προχωράει με κονδύλια που εκταμιεύονται από ΕΕ και υποχρεωτική εφαρμογή στα νοσοκομεία. Το εμπόδιο της μη συμμετοχής των ιδιωτών γιατρών λόγω των χαμηλών απολαβών προσπερνιέται με το να πληρώνει τον γιατρό ο ασθενής. Το πιθανότερο τελικά είναι ο ασθενής να μην μπορεί καν να επισκεφθεί τον προσωπικό γιατρό ο οποίος θα του αρνηθεί την πρόσβαση στο νοσοκομείο. Φραγμός για τον φραγμό...
 </p>
<p>
  Η συνέχεια κι η ένταση της πολιτικής που θα ρημάζει εργασιακά δικαιώματα για τους υγειονομικούς και το δικαίωμα του λαού στη δωρεάν πλήρη και ίση για όλους περίθαλψη είναι δεδομένη. Αυτό που θα πρέπει να μας απασχολεί διαρκώς είναι το πώς οικοδομούνται αντιστάσεις απ’ την πλευρά των λαϊκών δυνάμεων στην κατεύθυνση να μπαίνει φραγμός σ’ αυτή την πολιτική. Ο σκόπελος των ξεπουλημένων συνδικαλιστικών ηγεσιών και η πολιτική γραμμή των ρεφορμιστικών δυνάμεων, με κύριο το ΚΚΕ, είναι αναγνωρισμένα εμπόδια στην ανάπτυξη αυτής της κατεύθυνσης. Όπως, όμως, δεδομένη είναι και η γενικευμένη λαϊκή δυσαρέσκεια, που μπορεί να τροφοδοτήσει σημαντικές εστίες αντίστασης.

   Από την αρχική της φάση και σε όλη τη διαδρομή της μέχρι τη σημερινή μορφή της, η ΕΕ υπήρξε και υπάρχει ως ένα εγχείρημα των ιμπεριαλιστών της Ευρώπης. Είναι ένας συνασπισμός για την υπηρέτηση και την προώθηση των συμφερόντων και των επιδιώξεων πριν από όλα των ιμπεριαλιστικών πυλώνων του. Οι αξεπέραστες αντιθέσεις μεταξύ αυτών των ιμπεριαλιστικών δυνάμεων είναι που βάζουν όρια στην «ενότητα» του εγχειρήματος, το οποίο κάθε άλλο παρά ιστορική νομοτέλεια είναι. Το Brexit ήταν μια σαφής εκδήλωση αυτών των αντιθέσεων, που σήμερα εκδηλώνονται μεταξύ των δύο βασικών πυλώνων του (Γαλλία-Γερμανία) και μεταφέρονται στους δορυφόρους τους, αλλά τροφοδοτούνται και από την ανάμειξη των ΗΠΑ σε μια σειρά χώρες και αστικές τάξεις που βρίσκονται στο σημερινό συνασπισμό των «27».
  </li>
<li>
   Ως εγχείρημα στην υπηρεσία του ευρωπαϊκού μονοπωλιακού κεφαλαίου, η ΕΕ πρωταγωνίστησε πάντα στην εκμετάλλευση και την καταλήστευση εργατών, λαών και χωρών εντός της ΕΕ και έξω από αυτήν. Η πολιτική αυτή κλιμακώθηκε μετά το ξέσπασμα της κρίσης του 2008 και συνεχίζεται ολοένα πιο άγρια, επιβεβαιώνοντας με τον πιο οδυνηρό τρόπο για τις εργαζόμενες μάζες ότι είναι αντιδραστικός μύθος η λεγόμενη «σύγκλιση». Οι χώρες της περιφέρειας, οι εξαρτημένες χώρες –είτε είναι είτε δεν είναι στην ΟΝΕ– γίνονται ολοένα και περισσότερο οικονομικά παραρτήματα των ιμπεριαλιστικών μονοπωλίων. Ταυτόχρονα, και εντός της Γαλλίας και της Γερμανίας κλιμακώνεται η άγρια καπιταλιστική επίθεση ενάντια στην εργατική τάξη, τον λαό και τη νεολαία. Οι μεγάλοι εργατικοί και λαϊκοί αγώνες που ξεσπούν και στις χώρες αυτές αντιμετωπίζονται με τρομοκρατία και καταστολή, με κήρυξη καταστάσεων απαγόρευσης και περιστολής των λαϊκών ελευθεριών. Όλα αυτά συνοδεύονται με την έξαρση του πιο χυδαίου αντικομμουνισμού που γίνεται νόμος και «θεσμός» από την ΕΕ και σε μια σειρά χώρες που βρίσκονται σε αυτήν. Η «κοιτίδα της δημοκρατίας» αποκαλύπτει διαρκώς τον αντιδημοκρατικό και βίαιο χαρακτήρα της, το αποτρόπαιο ιμπεριαλιστικό-καπιταλιστικό πρόσωπό της.
  </li>
<li>
   Ως συνασπισμός των Ευρωπαίων ιμπεριαλιστών, η ΕΕ πρωτοστατεί διαχρονικά στις πολεμικές επεμβάσεις, στις σφαγές λαών, στο κομμάτιασμα χωρών. Αυτή είναι, εξάλλου, η «ιστορική ταυτότητα» των πυλώνων της που συνεχίζουν την αποικιοκρατική τους ιστορία. Είτε ως σύνολο είτε διχασμένοι στη βάση των στρατηγικών συμφερόντων τους, ως στρατηγικό συμπλήρωμα του αμερικάνικου ιμπεριαλισμού, οι ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές και το εγχείρημά τους, η ΕΕ, αναδείχνονται μεγάλοι εχθροί της ανεξαρτησίας και της ίδιας της ζωής των λαών. Συνέβαλαν και συμβάλλουν στην τροφοδότηση του άδικου πολέμου στην Ουκρανία, στις εκατόμβες νεκρών και σακατεμένων, στην καταστροφή της χώρας αυτής. Στηρίζουν και υποθάλπουν τη σιωνιστική σφαγή, την εξελισσόμενη γενοκτονία του παλαιστινιακού λαού, κηρύσσοντας ταυτόχρονα απαγορευμένη εντός των μητροπόλεών τους τη σημαία ενός λαού που μάχεται ενάντια στον κατακτητή, για λεύτερη πατρίδα. Οργανώνουν και καθοδηγούν αδιανόητα μαζικά εγκλήματα μεταναστών και προσφύγων, ξεριζωμένων από χώρες και περιοχές που και οι ίδιοι οι ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές έχουν λεηλατήσει και βομβαρδίσει.
  </li>
<li>
   Στη σημερινή φάση των μεγάλων ιμπεριαλιστικών ανταγωνισμών που προετοιμάζουν έως και παγκόσμιο μακελειό, οι εκβιασμοί μεταξύ Γαλλίας-Γερμανίας (με τα πυρηνικά της η πρώτη, με την οικονομική πρωτοκαθεδρία της η δεύτερη) εναλλάσσονται με τις επιδιώξεις κοινών συμφωνιών. Συμφωνίες που θα τους επιτρέψουν να αντιμετωπίσουν τα κρίσιμα προβλήματά τους σε ενέργεια και πρώτες ύλες, καθώς βρίσκονται υπό την αμερικάνικη στρατηγική κηδεμονία, αλλά και σε μεγάλη πίεση από τη διείσδυση της Κίνας. Η όποια εξέλιξη προκύψει από αυτές τις αντιφατικές τακτικές και επιλογές των ιμπεριαλιστικών πυλώνων της ΕΕ στρέφεται ενάντια στους λαούς! Είτε με αναβαθμισμένη τη συνεργασία Παρισιού-Βερολίνου (και άρα με πιο συγκροτημένο το οικοδόμημα της ΕΕ), είτε με αναπαραγωγή και διεύρυνση των τωρινών διχασμών τους και την ΕΕ χωρισμένη σε «παλιά» και «νέα» (αμερικάνικη) Ευρώπη, οι λαοί μόνο χειρότερα δεινά έχουν να περιμένουν: άγρια εκμετάλλευση, καταπίεση και καταστολή, εκτόξευση των πολεμικών δαπανών και στρατιωτικοποίηση των οικονομιών, μεγαλύτερα βήματα προς τον παγκόσμιο πόλεμο!
  </li>
<li>
   Όλα τα παραπάνω αποτυπώνονται ήδη στα πολιτικά συστήματα όλων των χωρών της ΕΕ, που αντιμετωπίζουν την απαξίωση των εργατικών-λαϊκών μαζών και μετατοπίζονται σε αντιδραστική κατεύθυνση, και με την ανάδειξη (ακόμα και σε κυβερνητικούς ρόλους) ακροδεξιών δυνάμεων. Δυνάμεων που τροφοδοτούνται από τη γενικευμένη επίθεση ενάντια στο προλεταριάτο και τους λαούς, από την κλιμάκωση της πολιτικής που καταπνίγει ελευθερίες και δημοκρατικά δικαιώματα, της πολιτικής των πολέμων και των κηρυγμάτων εθνικισμού, μίσους και διχασμού των λαών. Ταυτόχρονα, στις ιμπεριαλιστικές χώρες (Γαλλία, Γερμανία, αλλά και Ιταλία) η ανάδειξη αυτών των ακροδεξιών δυνάμεων αποτελεί και έκφραση δυσαρέσκειας τμημάτων της μεγαλοαστικής τάξης που συμπιέζονται από τους ιμπεριαλιστικούς ανταγωνισμούς και αναζητούν απαντήσεις προβάλλοντας τον πιο επιθετικό εθνικισμό, τον ιμπεριαλιστικό.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Η «μεγάλη αναστάτωση» ενόψει των ευρωεκλογών του Ιουνίου και η κρισιμότητα που τους αποδίδουν οι ιμπεριαλιστές και οι αστικές δυνάμεις, στην πραγματικότητα αναφέρονται σε όλα τα παραπάνω ζητήματα. Οι κυρίαρχες δυνάμεις επιδιώκουν να αξιοποιηθούν οι ευρωκάλπες ως εργαλείο, αφενός για την αναστύλωση της –ξεφτισμένης συνολικά στις συνειδήσεις των λαών– «ιδέας» της ΕΕ, και αφετέρου για την αντιμετώπιση των προβλημάτων στα πολιτικά συστήματα της κάθε χώρας. Είναι πολύ χαρακτηριστικό ότι όλες οι ακροδεξιές δυνάμεις επιδίδονται με ζέση στην προεκλογική εκστρατεία και στηρίζουν την «ιδέα» της ΕΕ, χωρίς ίχνος «απομονωτιστικών» διαθέσεων. Αποδείχνουν έτσι ξανά την πλήρη υπόκλισή τους και στο ιμπεριαλιστικό πλαίσιο και στις ανάγκες της αστικής τάξης που η κάθε μια αναφέρεται.

   Στη χώρα μας, πίσω από την παραρτηματοποίηση της οικονομίας, την αποβιομηχάνιση και τη συρρίκνωση του πρωτογενή τομέα, πίσω από τη διαρκώς μεγαλύτερη ενεργειακή και διατροφική εξάρτηση βρίσκονται τα συμφέροντα των ευρωπαϊκών μονοπωλίων. Αυτά καθοδήγησαν μια ολόκληρη πορεία (44 χρόνων από την ένταξη στην τότε ΕΟΚ) καταστροφής παραγωγικών δυνάμεων και δυνατοτήτων, καταλήστευσης του πλούτου και των υποδομών της χώρας. Οι πολιτικές της ΕΕ βρίσκονται πίσω από το έγκλημα στα Τέμπη, πίσω από τον πνιγμό και την καταστροφή της Θεσσαλίας. Ταυτόχρονα, αυτές οι πολιτικές αποτέλεσαν και την πολιτική πλάτη στην πολύχρονη επίθεση που σαρώνει κατακτήσεις και γκρεμίζει εργασιακά, κοινωνικά και δημοκρατικά δικαιώματα της εργατικής τάξης, του λαού και της νεολαίας. Στο όνομα της «ευρωπαϊκής ιδέας», των «απαιτούμενων δημοσιονομικών προσαρμογών» και του «εναρμονισμού με το ενωσιακό δίκαιο», η άρχουσα τάξη και οι κυβερνήσεις στη χώρα προωθούν και επιβάλλουν χρόνια τώρα τον «εργασιακό μεσαίωνα», τη συντριβή της δωρεάν περίθαλψης και των δωρεάν σπουδών, το ξεκλήρισμα της φτωχομεσαίας αγροτιάς, τους μαζικούς πλειστηριασμούς των λαϊκών σπιτιών. Στον ίδιο «λογαριασμό», και στο πλαίσιο της διπλής εξάρτησης από ΗΠΑ και Ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές, βρίσκονται και τα θηριώδη εξοπλιστικά προγράμματα από Γερμανία και Γαλλία, καθώς και η συμφωνία με τη Γαλλία για στρατιωτική συνδρομή της Ελλάδας στις ανάγκες της ακόμα και στη ζώνη του Σαχέλ!
  </li>
<li>
   Η άρχουσα τάξη της χώρας έχει κάθε λόγο να παρουσιάζει στον λαό αυτόν τον πραγματικό απολογισμό αντεστραμμένο, να επιδιώκει σταθερά να παρουσιάσει την ΕΕ ως μια προοδευτική νομοτέλεια για τον λαό και τη χώρα. Γιατί είναι δεμένη και εξαρτημένη με χίλια νήματα από τους ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές και τής είναι αδιανόητη η αναπαραγωγή της έξω από αυτό το πλαίσιο. Γιατί με το να είναι μέλος της ΕΕ/ΟΝΕ αντλεί πολιτική ισχύ έναντι της εργατικής τάξης και του λαού. Γιατί τα μεταπρατικά μεγαλοαστικά τζάκια θησαυρίζουν ξεπουλώντας τον πλούτο και τις υποδομές της χώρας, παίρνοντας ποσοστά στα μεγάλα έργα, κάνοντας μεσιτείες και εισαγωγές-εξαγωγές στο πλευρό και ως παράρτημα των ευρωπαϊκών μονοπωλίων. Γιατί τα ίδια τζάκια παρασιτούν με τις δόσεις των δισ. ευρώ του «Ευρωπαϊκού Ταμείου Ανάκαμψης», που πληρώνεται στο πολλαπλάσιο από τον ιδρώτα και τα δικαιώματα των εργατών και του λαού. Γιατί συνολικά το ντόπιο κεφάλαιο αυξάνει τη λεηλασία της εργατικής δύναμης και των λαϊκών εισοδημάτων καθώς οι πλάτες των προστατών στηρίζουν την άγρια καπιταλιστική επίθεση.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Γι’ αυτό όλα τα κόμματα του συστήματος (από τα ακροδεξιά ως τα λεγόμενα κεντροαριστερά) βομβαρδίζουν τον λαό απαιτώντας να ξεχάσει, να αγνοήσει τα δεινά που συσσώρευσε και συσσωρεύει από την ένταξη της χώρας στην ΕΕ/ΟΝΕ, και να αναζητήσει (με αυτές ή τις άλλες διαπραγματεύσεις) μέσα σε αυτήν το μέλλον του! Γι’ αυτό και στο όνομα της «συνεργασίας των λαών» που τάχα η ΕΕ εκπροσωπεί, η χώρα και οι θάλασσές της μετατρέπονται σε τάφο και σε φυλακή των ξεριζωμένων κομματιών των λαών, ώστε να προστατεύονται τα ευρωπαϊκά σύνορα από τους κατατρεγμένους. Με την ίδια επίκληση (της «συνεργασίας των λαών») η χώρα διατάσσεται σε θέση πολέμου και έχθρας με τους λαούς της περιοχής, ώστε να υπηρετηθούν οι ευρωατλαντικοί προστάτες της!
 </p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
   Όλες αυτές οι πολιτικές της ΕΕ διαμορφώνονται και αποφασίζονται σε μυστικές και φανερές συσκέψεις των ιμπεριαλιστικών επιτελείων της, μέσα από τις αντιθέσεις και τους συμβιβασμούς τους και την πάγια επιδίωξή τους να σύρουν με «καρότα» και εκβιασμούς και τις εξαρτημένες αστικές τάξεις του οικοδομήματός τους. Ακόμα και το «τυπικό» των κανονισμών και των διαδικασιών λήψης αποφάσεων προσαρμόζεται όλο και περισσότερο σε αυτήν την πραγματικότητα, καθώς οι επείγουσες ιμπεριαλιστικές ανάγκες απαιτούν μια όλο και πιο ευπροσάρμοστη στα συμφέροντά τους ΕΕ. Πάνω σε αυτή την πραγματικότητα έχει στηθεί η απάτη του λεγόμενου Ευρωκοινοβουλίου, που έχει ρόλο δημοκρατικής διακόσμησης του ιμπεριαλιστικού συνασπισμού. Ωστόσο, ούτε αυτό δεν (θα μπορούσε να) είναι απλώς μια αθώα φάρσα. Τα πρόσφατα (π.χ. Καϊλή) και παλιότερα «σκάνδαλα» αναδείχνουν πως –ως φυτώριο παραγωγής και ανάδειξης στελεχών του μηχανισμού της γραφειοκρατίας των Βρυξελλών– είναι ταυτόχρονα και πεδίο διαμόρφωσης των χρυσοπληρωμένων λόμπι του ευρωπαϊκού κεφαλαίου για την προώθηση των κάθε είδους συμφερόντων του εντός της ΕΕ, αλλά και σε Αφρική, Μ. Ανατολή, Βαλκάνια.
  </li>
<li>
   Με βάση όλα τα παραπάνω, είναι πιο φανερό και από τον ήλιο πως οι μεγάλοι αγώνες, τα αιτήματα και τα συμφέροντα των εργατικών-λαϊκών μαζών της Ευρώπης δεν μπορούν να «συναντηθούν» –και πολύ περισσότερο να δικαιωθούν– μέσα στη φυλακή των λαών που οι ευρωπαίοι ιμπεριαλιστές συγκρότησαν και ακούει στο όνομα ΕΕ! Τα ταξικά δικαιώματα και η επαναστατική προοπτική των μαζών δεν μπορούν να εκφραστούν σε ένα όργανο όπως το Ευρωκοινοβούλιο, που δεν είναι κατάκτηση των λαών, αλλά ιμπεριαλιστική κατασκευή. Στην καταγγελία αυτής της κατασκευής και στην πάλη ενάντια στην ΕΕ βρίσκεται ο δρόμος της «συνάντησης» των αγώνων, της διεθνιστικής αλληλεγγύης, της ανάπτυξης της μαζικής πάλης των εργατών και των λαών. Η πάλη αυτή διαμορφώνει όρους επαναστατικής προοπτικής στο βαθμό που χειραφετείται από το πολιτικό πλαίσιο που ορίζει το καπιταλιστικό-ιμπεριαλιστικό σύστημα, στο βαθμό που αρνείται να καναλιζαριστεί σε αυτό το πολιτικό πλαίσιο και ανοίγει τους δικούς της δρόμους.
  </li>
<li>
   Στη χώρα μας, η παρατεταμένη προεκλογική εκστρατεία ενόψει της 9
   <sup>
    ης
   </sup>
   του Ιούνη όλων των κομμάτων του επίσημου πολιτικού συστήματος, από τη μια απηχεί την ανάγκη υπεράσπισης της «ευρωπαϊκής ιδέας». Όμως, το ερώτημα «ποια Ευρώπη θέλουμε», που προβάλλουν τα κόμματα του συστήματος και οι συνοδοιπόροι τους, θα ήταν φάρσα αν ο λαός μας δεν ζούσε μια εξελισσόμενη τραγωδία σε βάρος όλων των στοιχειωδών δικαιωμάτων του. Από την άλλη, η παρατεταμένη προεκλογική ένταση απηχεί την επιχείρηση αναστύλωσης του απαξιωμένου στον λαό πολιτικού συστήματος σε ακόμα πιο αντιδραστική βάση. Οι δυνάμεις του συμβιβασμού –όπως η ηγεσία του ΚΚΕ– συμβάλλουν σε αυτή τη δεξιά πορεία, ακόμα και στην πολιτική νομιμοποίηση της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης και της απάτης που λέγεται Ευρωκοινοβούλιο, ενώ υποτίθεται ότι καταγγέλλουν την ΕΕ και τις πολιτικές της. Η ηγεσία αυτή έφτασε στο σημείο να ανακαλύψει τον «αριστερό ευρωμονόδρομο»: Χρησιμοποιεί το «ορόσημο» της ευρωκάλπης ως λόγο να ανακοπούν οι μαζικοί αγώνες νεολαίας, αγροτών, εργαζομένων για να δοθεί η «πολιτική μάχη των ευρωεκλογών»!
  </li>
<li>
   Η πλατιά λαϊκή αποστροφή και δυσαρέσκεια απέναντι στην πολιτική της κυβέρνησης της ΝΔ, την πολιτική του συστήματος και όλων των κομμάτων που τη στηρίζουν –από τη λεγόμενη κεντροαριστερά (ΣΥΡΙΖΑ, ΠΑΣΟΚ, Πλεύση, Νέα Αριστερά) και από ακροδεξιά (Βελόπουλος, Νίκη, Σπαρτιάτες)– δεν χωράει στο «επίσημο γκάλοπ» των ευρωεκλογών. Δεν πρέπει να διαστραφεί με τον εκβιασμό της αποδοχής της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης από την ΕΕ.
   <strong>
    Ο λαός δεν έχει κανένα λόγο να συμμεριστεί την αναστάτωση και τις αντιδραστικές διεργασίες του πολιτικού συστήματος. Έχει κάθε λόγο να συνεχίσει στο δρόμο των μαζικών αγώνων και κάθε λόγο να αρνηθεί την ευρωκάλπη, να απέχει από αυτήν. Γιατί αυτή
   </strong>
   η εκλογική στάση αντιστοιχεί στην προβολή της αναγκαίας θέσης «ΕΞΩ Η ΕΛΛΑΔΑ ΑΠΌ ΤΗΝ ΕΕ». Γιατί αυτή η εκλογική στάση αναδείχνει τη
   <strong>
    συνολική άρνηση
   </strong>
   της ιμπεριαλιστικής εξάρτησης από ΗΠΑ και ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές, την άρνηση του «μονόδρομου» της φτώχειας, της εξαθλίωσης, της εκμετάλλευσης και των πολέμων, τον οποίο διασφαλίζει το πλαίσιο της εξάρτησης της χώρας.
  </li>
<li>
   Με βάση τη θέση για
   <strong>
    Αποχή από τις ευρωεκλογές
   </strong>
   επιδιώκουμε συντονισμό με αγωνιστικές, αριστερές, επαναστατικές δυνάμεις στην Ευρώπη. Στην ίδια βάση, επιδιώκουμε και στη χώρα μας την πιο πλατιά ανάδειξη αυτής της κατεύθυνσης, τον συντονισμό, τη συμπόρευση και την από κοινού διαμόρφωση πολιτικής καμπάνιας για την προβολή της θέσης «ΕΞΩ Η ΕΛΛΑΔΑ ΑΠΟ ΤΗΝ ΕΕ», για την άρνηση και την εναντίωση στην ευρωκάλπη και τις αντιδραστικές επιδιώξεις των κομμάτων και των δυνάμεων του συστήματος.

  Συνεχίζονται οι αντιδραστικές μεθοδεύσεις της κυβέρνησης της ΝΔ στον χώρο της εκπαίδευσης, προχωρώντας το υπουργείο Παιδείας σε νέες εισηγήσεις που αφορούν τις προϋποθέσεις για την απόκτηση του Εθνικού Απολυτηρίου στα Λύκεια. Στο πλαίσιο του διαλόγου που διεξάγεται για τη «μεγάλη μεταρρύθμιση στην Πρωτοβάθμια και τη Δευτεροβάθμια Εκπαίδευση», έρχεται να προστεθεί στο προαναγγελμένο -από την κυβέρνηση- εξεταστικό κάτεργο του νέου λυκείου η προϋπόθεση της πιστοποίησης γνώσης των αγγλικών και της πληροφορικής για την απόκτηση του Εθνικού Απολυτηρίου. Δεν πρόκειται για «φετινή έμπνευση» του Κυριάκου Πιερρακάκη, καθώς ήδη από το 2017 το Ινστιτούτο Εκπαιδευτικής Πολιτικής, ως αρμόδιος φορέας του Υπουργείου Παιδείας για τον σχεδιασμό των αντιδραστικών μεθοδεύσεων στην εκπαίδευση, έκανε λόγο για πλάνο ενσωμάτωσης της πιστοποίησης της αγγλικής γλώσσας, ως πρώτης ξένης γλώσσας στο σχολείο από την Α’ Λυκείου. Η επίθεση των κυβερνήσεων στην εκπαίδευση κλιμακώνεται και είναι σίγουρο πως για την απόκτηση των εν λόγω πιστοποιήσεων οι μαθητές θα αναγκάζονται να στραφούν σε περισσότερα φροντιστήρια για να μπορέσουν να ανταπεξέλθουν, αφήνοντας στο περιθώριο όλους εκείνους που δεν θα έχουν την οικονομική δυνατότητα να ξεπεράσουν ακόμη έναν ταξικό φραγμό.
 </p>
<p>
  Τα εμπόδια για τους μαθητές των φτωχών και λαϊκών στρωμάτων πολλαπλασιάζονται. Η κυβέρνηση προσπαθεί με γοργούς ρυθμούς να ξεδιπλώσει την ατζέντα της επίθεσης στα σχολεία. Αναφέρεται πως το Εθνικό Απολυτήριο θα «εγκαινιαστεί» από τους μαθητές που θα φοιτήσουν στην Α’ Λυκείου το επόμενο σχολικό έτος, οι οποίοι θα πρέπει να αντιμετωπίσουν και στις τρεις τάξεις του λυκείου ένα εξεταστικό κάτεργο αντίστοιχο των πανελλαδικών, με θέματα από την Τράπεζα Θεμάτων και ειδικό συντελεστή βαρύτητας ανά τάξη (μεγαλύτερος στη Γ’ και μικρότερος στην Α’ Λυκείου), ενώ παράλληλα προβλέπεται ο προσδιορισμός του αριθμού των εισακτέων στην τριτοβάθμια από τα τμήματα των Πανεπιστημίων.
  <strong>
   Με ψηφισμένο πλέον τον νόμο για τα Ιδιωτικά Πανεπιστήμια, συνεχίζεται να εφαρμόζεται το σκληρά ταξικό πλαίσιο, μέσα στο οποίο τα παιδιά των λαϊκών οικογενειών όχι απλά θα πετιούνται εκτός των Πανεπιστημίων, αλλά και από τα Γενικά Λύκεια, προβάλλοντας η κυβέρνηση σαν εναλλακτική τη διοχέτευση προς την επαγγελματική εκπαίδευση και τη μαθητεία.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Η αντίσταση των μαθητών για να μην περάσουν τα νέα μέτρα και για να ανατραπούν όλοι οι αντιλαϊκοί ψηφισμένοι νόμοι στην εκπαίδευση αποτελεί αναγκαιότητα. Μέσα από τα 5μελή και τα 15μελή συνδικαλιστικά τους όργανα, με όπλα τις γενικές συνελεύσεις, τις καταλήψεις και τις διαδηλώσεις, πρέπει να πάρουν αποφάσεις για τη συνέχιση του αγώνα! Πλάι στους φοιτητές που επί μήνες έδωσαν έναν μαζικό και μαχητικό αγώνα για να μην περάσει ο νόμος Πιερρακάκη. Δίπλα στους εκπαιδευτικούς που τρομοκρατούνται επειδή διεκδικούν εργασιακά δικαιώματα και σέρνονται σε δίκες για τη συνδικαλιστική τους δράση. Ο αγώνας ενάντια στην παιδεία των λίγων και εκλεκτών είναι υπόθεση πάλης όλου του λαού.

  Η εισβολή αστυνομικών δυνάμεων στη Σχολή Θετικών Επιστημών (ΣΘΕ) του ΑΠΘ, το μεσημέρι του Σαββάτου 16/3 για την εκκένωση των καταλήψεων που τελούνταν σε τμήματα εντός της και η σύλληψη 49 φοιτητών αποτελεί σοβαρό δείγμα του ρεβανσισμού του συστήματος απέναντι στο φοιτητικό κίνημα.
 </p>
<p>
  Χρησιμοποιώντας σαν αφορμή φθορές έξω από τη «βιβλιοθήκη» στο πρώην στέκι του Βιολογικού (που εδώ και 2 χρόνια από όταν εκκενώθηκε, ακόμα… γίνεται βιβλιοθήκη), αστυνομικές δυνάμεις εισέβαλαν στον χώρο της ΣΘΕ την ώρα που πραγματοποιούνταν δράση στα πλαίσια της κατάληψης του Σ.Φ. Γεωλογίας, συλλαμβάνοντας μαζικά φοιτητές, στους οποίους απέδωσαν κατηγορίες για διατάραξη κοινής ειρήνης και απείθεια. Μάλιστα, οι συλληφθέντες φοιτητές κρατήθηκαν στη ΓΑΔΘ μέχρι και τη Δευτέρα 18/3, λέγοντάς τους ότι «μπροστά στους 2 μήνες που κρατάνε την κατάληψη, οι 2 μέρες κράτησης δεν είναι τίποτα». Είναι σαφές ότι ο πραγματικός λόγος αυτής της επιχείρησης καταστολής δεν είναι καμία φθορά κτηρίου ή «παράνομη ενέργεια». Έψαχναν μόνο μια αφορμή, μέχρι και αυτή του… «πυρηνικού ριφιφί», ή ό,τι άλλο μπορούσαν να σκαρφιστούν, για να δικαιολογήσουν την εισβολή και την άγρια καταστολή.
 </p>
<p>
  Το χρονικό της εκκένωσης και του οργίου συλλήψεων στη ΣΘΕ δεν είναι τυχαίο. Σε μια φάση όπου το φοιτητικό κίνημα βρίσκεται σε υποχώρηση, το σύστημα βρήκε την ευκαιρία να πάρει τη «ρεβάνς», να χτυπήσει όποια ψεγάδια καταλήψεων και αντιστάσεων έχουν παραμείνει στις σχολές. Δεν είναι, άλλωστε, η πρώτη εκκένωση κατάληψης που έχει δει το φοιτητικό κίνημα στον δίμηνο αγώνα του ενάντια στον, πλέον ψηφισμένο, νόμο Πιερρακάκη. Η εκκένωση της κατάληψης της Νομικής στην Κομοτηνή, της Νομικής του ΑΠΘ, αλλά και της Πρυτανείας, πριν από λίγες εβδομάδες έδειξαν τις κυβερνητικές διαθέσεις. Μέχρι και στις Φοιτητικές Εστίες του Πανεπιστημίου Αθηνών (ΦΕΠΑ) εισέβαλαν, συλλαμβάνοντας 3 φοιτητές και αποδίδοντάς τους 3 κατηγορίες. Το σύστημα φοβάται τη φοιτητική νεολαία που, εδώ και 2 μήνες, βρίσκεται στους δρόμους και αγωνίζεται. Ιδιαιτέρως, δεν ανέχεται τους φοιτητές που, ακόμη και μετά την ψήφιση του νόμου, επιμένουν να βγαίνουν στον δρόμο για να τον ανατρέψουν.
 </p>
<p>
  Το φοιτητικό κίνημα, λοιπόν, καλείται να τα βάλει με θεούς και δαίμονες. Πρώτα και κύρια, καλείται να τα βάλει με το σύστημα, που όλο και οξύνει τις μεθόδους καταστολής του. Η άμεση καταστολή και το σπάσιμο των καταλήψεων αποτελεί συνέχεια όλων των υπόλοιπων μεθόδων καταστολής, με πρώτη και κύρια την αξιοποίηση των τηλε-εξετάσεων και των τηλε-μαθημάτων, που αποτέλεσε έναν ύπουλο τρόπο να απομαζικοποιηθούν και να σπάσουν οι καταλήψεις χωρίς γάτα και ζημιά. Η καταστολή των διαδηλώσεων με άγριο τρόπο, τα χημικά και το «κυνηγητό» φοιτητών μέσα στο Άσυλο δεν αρκούν στο σύστημα. Τώρα βρίσκει την ευκαιρία για την ενεργοποίηση και την αξιοποίηση των πειθαρχικών διώξεων του νόμου Κεραμέως-Χρυσοχοΐδη (4777). Ήδη η κυβέρνηση, δια στόματος Μητσοτάκη, και η ΠτΔ, Κ. Σακελλαροπούλου, ζήτησαν την εφαρμογή για πρώτη φορά των έσχατων πειθαρχικών διώξεων που προβλέπει ο Νόμος Κεραμέως, δηλαδή της διαγραφής (μεταξύ μιας σειράς άλλων ποινών) στην περίπτωση των 49 συλληφθέντων φοιτητών, αλλά και σε μελλοντικές αντίστοιχες περιπτώσεις «παράνομων» ενεργειών. Το φοιτητικό κίνημα, λοιπόν, στον αγώνα του ενάντια στον νόμο Πιερρακάκη, θα κληθεί να αντιπαρατεθεί και με τις διατάξεις του νόμου 4777 (που ήδη κομμάτια του, όπως αυτό της ΕΒΕ, εφαρμόζονται), με τις διαγραφές και τα πειθαρχικά, αλλά και με όλο το κατασταλτικό οπλοστάσιο που έχει το σύστημα στα χέρια του.
 </p>
<p>
  Καλείται, από την άλλη, να τα βάλει και με τους ψεύτικους φίλους του. Με ευθύνη των κύριων ρεφορμιστικών δυνάμεων (ΚΝΕ-ΑΡΙΣ) που κήρυξαν παύση του κινήματος, αλλά και όλων των υπόλοιπων που βλέπουν την πάλη για την ανατροπή του νόμου ως κάτι το «ουτοπικό», οι φοιτητές, που κινητοποιήθηκαν με επιμονή όλο το προηγούμενο διάστημα, έμειναν ξεκρέμαστοι. Από τη μία ΚΝΕ-ΑΡΙΣ κάνουν λόγο για «πολύμορφες δράσεις πέραν της κατάληψης», οι οποίες από ό,τι φαίνεται δεν συμπεριλαμβάνουν καν… τη διαδήλωση. Μάλιστα, στην πλειοψηφία των συλλόγων πανελλαδικά, αυτές οι δυνάμεις είναι που συσπειρώνουν πλέον τα πλαίσια «αντι-κατάληψης», ενώ με το ζόρι (έως καθόλου) στήριξαν τις κινητοποιήσεις αλληλεγγύης στους συλληφθέντες φοιτητές. Από την άλλη, η ΑΡΑΣ και μια σειρά άλλες δυνάμεις βγαίνουν με τη σημαία του «να μείνει ο νόμος στα χαρτιά». Λες και δεν είδαμε με την Ελάχιστη Βάση Εισαγωγής τι συμβαίνει με τους νόμους που «έμειναν στα χαρτιά». Κάποια στιγμή το σύστημα τους εφαρμόζει!
 </p>
<p>
  Κόντρα, λοιπόν, σε αυτές τις λογικές, το φοιτητικό κίνημα πρέπει να στυλώσει τα πόδια του και να συνεχίσει τον αγώνα για την ανατροπή του νόμου Πιερρακάκη. Να συνεχίσει με εκ νέου γενικές συνελεύσεις, που θα παίρνουν αποφάσεις συνέχισης του αγώνα με νέες καταλήψεις και διαδηλώσεις. Το φοιτητικό κίνημα έχει δείξει ότι μπορεί να ανατρέψει μέχρι και ψηφισμένους νόμους, και καμία δύναμη -συστημική ή ρεφορμιστική- δεν μπορεί να το διαψεύσει αυτό!
 </p>
<p>
  Και αυτή είναι που θα αποτελέσει και την πραγματική απάντηση στην τρομοκρατία και την καταστολή. Αυτή είναι που θα αποτελέσει την πραγματική απάντηση στις ανυπόστατες κατηγορίες των 49 συλληφθέντων της ΣΘΕ και στις απειλές για πειθαρχικές διώξεις και διαγραφές φοιτητών. Το φοιτητικό κίνημα μόνο με τις μαζικές του διαδικασίες μπορεί να «προστατευτεί» και να απαντήσει την τρομοκρατία! Με μαζικές γενικές συνελεύσεις που θα παίρνουν αποφάσεις αλληλεγγύης στους συλληφθέντες, θα απαιτούν την αθώωσή τους και που θα παίρνουν αποφάσεις συνέχισης του αγώνα μέχρι τη νίκη!

  Η πιθανή ήττα της Ουκρανίας θα αναδείξει τις αδυναμίες των δυτικών μηχανισμών. Και αυτό είναι κάτι που επιτείνει το αίσθημα στρατηγικού αδιεξόδου, ιδιαίτερα για τους ευρωπαίους ιμπεριαλιστές.
 </p>
<p>
  Η κατάσταση στο ουκρανικό μέτωπο είναι τέτοια που πλέον δεν υπαγορεύει σενάρια για την εξελισσόμενη σύγκρουση, αλλά για την επόμενη μέρα. Έχοντας η Μόσχα την πρωτοβουλία κινήσεων, το αγωνιώδες ερώτημα είναι όχι πού θα σταματήσει, αλλά πού θέλει να σταματήσει. Τα κέντρα της Δύσης εκτιμούν, και βάσιμα, πως οι στόχοι της πλέον δεν περιορίζονται στα σύνορα των τεσσάρων επαρχιών που προσαρτήθηκαν.
 </p>
<p>
  Η ευρωπαϊκή (αν)ασφάλεια έχει πολλές εκδοχές και ποικίλες εκδηλώσεις. Το τελευταίο διάστημα η επικαιρότητα μονοπωλείται από τις απειλές (λεονταρισμούς) του Μακρόν, που ξεκινούν με τη δήλωση «βόμβα» ότι δεν θα πρέπει να αποκλειστεί η αποστολή ΝΑΤΟϊκών δυνάμεων στην Ουκρανία.
 </p>
<p>
  Δεν πέρασε πολύς χρόνος από τον Ιούνιο του 2022, όταν ο Μακρόν δήλωνε: «
  <em>
   είμαι πεπεισμένος ότι ο ρόλος της Γαλλίας είναι αυτός μιας διαμεσολαβητικής δύναμης
  </em>
  »! Σήμερα, παρά τις ασάφειες και τις παλινωδίες του, ρίχνει συνεχώς λάδι στη φωτιά... «
  <em>
   Δεν είμαστε σε ευθεία σύρραξη με τη Ρωσία, αλλά δεν μπορούμε να την αφήσουμε να κερδίσει
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   Δεν είμαστε σε πόλεμο με τη Ρωσία, αλλά αυτή διεξάγει πόλεμο σε βάρος μας
  </em>
  », «
  <em>
   Αν η Ρωσία κερδίσει αυτόν τον πόλεμο, η αξιοπιστία της Ευρώπης θα μειωθεί στο μηδέν
  </em>
  » κ.λπ. Για τη Μόσχα μια τέτοια επίδειξη δύναμης (έστω και ρητορική) από τον επικεφαλής του γαλλικού κράτους, εκτός από ένα είδος μπλόφας, μπορεί να θεωρηθεί και «τροχιοδεικτικό» των δυτικών προθέσεων.
 </p>
<p>
  Ωστόσο η αντιρωσική πλειοδοσία του Μακρόν ίσως έχει και άλλες προεκτάσεις. Η αστική γαλλική τάξη βλέπει την «αξιοπιστία» της να μειώνεται τα τελευταία χρόνια σε μια παραδοσιακή σφαίρα επιρροής της: τη Δυτική Αφρική. Το αν η ανατολική άκρη της Ευρώπης μπορεί να αποτελέσει αντισταθμιστικό πεδίο δράσης του γαλλικού ιμπεριαλισμού είναι πολύ αμφίβολο. Πάντως, λίγο - πολύ, ο Μακρόν διαμηνύει στις χώρες της Α. Ευρώπης ότι η Γαλλία δεν έχει τις αναστολές της Γερμανίας και είναι πρόθυμη (και ικανή;) να αντικαταστήσει τις εγγυήσεις των ΗΠΑ σε εθνικό ή και σε ευρωπαϊκό επίπεδο! Η πρόθεση αυτή επικαιροποιήθηκε στην πρόσφατη τριμερή διάσκεψη κορυφής Γερμανίας, Γαλλίας και Πολωνίας στο Βερολίνο.
 </p>
<p>
  Από τη μεριά του ο γερμανός καγκελάριος Σολτς, αφού διευκρίνισε ότι οι χώρες που υποστηρίζουν την Ουκρανία δεν βρίσκονται σε πόλεμο με τη Ρωσία, αρκέστηκε στις διακηρύξεις τω Βρυξελλών σχετικά με την αρωγή της Ευρώπης προς την Ουκρανία. Το ζήτημα είναι σε ποιο βαθμό ελέγχει την τρικομματική του κυβέρνηση; Στις ακραίες φιλονατοϊκές και αντιρωσικές δηλώσεις της ΥΠΕΞ Μπέρμποκ (Πράσινοι), προστέθηκε η υπουργός Παιδείας της Γερμανίας Βάτσινγκερ (Φιλελεύθεροι), που, σε συνέντευξη που παραχώρησε στις εφημερίδες του ομίλου Funke, προτείνει προετοιμασία των μαθητών (στο πλαίσιο της πολιτικής προστασίας) για το ενδεχόμενο πολέμου… Το φαντάζεται μάλιστα ως κομμάτι της καθημερινής ζωής!
 </p>
<p>
  Τα ενδεχόμενα δεν είναι πολλά. Ή η Δύση θα κινηθεί προς την κατεύθυνση μιας πλήρους σύγκρουσης με τη Ρωσία ή θα προσπαθήσει να την ανακόψει με διαπραγματεύσεις, μετριάζοντας το όποιο κόστος. Αν ισχύσει το δεύτερο (πράγμα που δεν σημαίνει και τον άμεσο τερματισμό του πολέμου), οι όροι κατά βάση θα υπαγορεύονται από τη Μόσχα. Είναι φανερό πως οι δύο πλευρές δεν προσεγγίζουν με τον ίδιο τρόπο μια κατάπαυση του πυρός στην Ουκρανία. Δεν είναι μόνο ότι αυτή θα πρέπει να ξεκινήσει από την αποδοχή των νέων συνόρων και την παγίωση των όποιων κεκτημένων τους, αλλά θα πρέπει να απαντά και στους μακροπρόθεσμους στρατηγικούς τους στόχους. Σε ένα τέτοιο σενάριο εκτιμάται πως η ρωσική αντιπροσωπεία θα προσεγγίσει το τραπέζι με μια αίσθηση στρατηγικού πλεονεκτήματος. Για το Κρεμλίνο είναι βασικός όρος ότι οι διαπραγματεύσεις δεν θα ορίσουν μια νέα «παγωμένη σύγκρουση» ή «ένα διάλειμμα για επανεξοπλισμό της Ουκρανίας».
 </p>
<p>
  Ο Ρώσος πρόεδρος (που δεν αγωνιούσε ιδιαίτερα για την επανεκλογή του) δεν φαίνεται να βάζει σε πρώτο πλάνο τις διαβουλεύσεις. Σε δημόσια πανηγυρική ομιλία του (για την εκλογική του νίκη και την επέτειο προσάρτησης της Κριμαίας), επανέλαβε τις προειδοποιήσεις προς τη Δύση για χρήση πυρηνικών σε τυχόν «επίσημη» ανάπτυξη δυτικών στρατευμάτων στα ουκρανικά εδάφη. Αυτές οι προειδοποιήσεις Πούτιν δεν γίνονται στο κενό. Το φόντο είναι μακροχρόνιο και τα επίδικα ξεπερνούν τα σύνορα της Ουκρανίας. Έγινε καθαρό από τη Ρωσία πως μια πιθανή διαπραγμάτευση Δύσης- Ρωσίας δεν θα περιοριστεί τόσο στο «εδαφικό» όσο στη μελλοντική ουδετερότητα και αποστρατιωτικοποίησή της. Και ενδεχομένως να απαιτηθούν διασφαλίσεις που να αφορούν όλη την Α. Ευρώπη
 </p>
<p>
  Κατά την εκτίμηση δυτικών αναλυτών, φαίνεται ότι οι ΗΠΑ θα αρκούνταν να αποχωρήσει η Ρωσία από την Ουκρανία χωρίς άλλες εδαφικές κατακτήσεις. Ως ένδειξη κατευνασμού του Πούτιν θεωρείται η απόλυση της Νούλαντ, νούμερο 3 στο Στέιτ Ντιπάρτμεντ, με πεδίο ευθύνης την Ουκρανία εδώ και τουλάχιστον δέκα χρόνια. Ωστόσο η ενέργεια αυτή θα μπορούσε να θεωρηθεί και έμμεση παραδοχή των επιτευγμάτων της Ρωσίας στην Ουκρανία!
 </p>
<p>
  Οι εξελίξεις στο ουκρανικό μέτωπο ρίχνουν βαριά σκιά ήδη στο προεκλογικό τοπίο των ευρωεκλογών του Ιουνίου και των αμερικανικών εκλογών του Νοεμβρίου. Στην άλλη πλευρά του Ατλαντικού και στο φόντο της άγριας προεκλογικής κόντρας, ο Μπάιντεν εκφώνησε μια από τις πιο πολιτικές -και σημαντικές- ομιλίες για την κατάσταση της Ένωσης, παρουσιάζοντας με δραματικό τρόπο τα διακυβεύματα των επικείμενων εκλογών. Το πιο εντυπωσιακό στην ομιλία του ήταν (αν και οι ΗΠΑ δεν απειλούνται άμεσα με πόλεμο) ότι την ξεκίνησε επικαλούμενος την κατάσταση της Ένωσης επί Ρούσβελτ τον Ιανουάριο του 1941, πριν από την είσοδο της Αμερικής στον Β' Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο. Στο ρόλο του Χίτλερ και των Ναζί έβαλε τον πρώην Πρόεδρο Τραμπ και το κίνημά του: «Make America Great Again» (MAGA). Ο Μπάιντεν επανερχόταν επανειλημμένα στο θέμα της συνδυασμένης εσωτερικής και εξωτερικής απειλής, με έμφαση στην εσωτερική! Μάλιστα έφτασε να ταυτίζει τον Τραμπ με τους Συνομοσπονδιακούς που αποσχίστηκαν από την Ενωση στον αμερικανικό εμφύλιο.
 </p>
<p>
  Όλα αυτά αντανακλούν φόβους για τους συσχετισμούς που πάνε να διαμορφωθούν, όπως δείχνουν άλλωστε οι εξελίξεις, και το αβέβαιο της κατάληξής τους τόσο στα πεδία των μαχών σε Ουκρανία αλλά και Γάζα όσο και σε ολόκληρη τη Μέση Ανατολή. Αναδεικνύονται αστάθμητοι παράμετροι που διαμορφώνουν μια πρωτοφανή κατάσταση, θέτοντας γενικότερα ζητήματα επαναξιολόγησης των ιμπεριαλιστικών σχέσεων. Μια κατάσταση λεπτών ισορροπιών, που αντανακλά τη διακύβευση των συμφερόντων των κυρίαρχων ιμπεριαλιστών τόσο περιφερειακά όσο και συνολικά στην παγκόσμια σκηνή.
 </p>
<p>
  Μια κατάσταση που, αναδεικνύοντας την πολύπλευρη δυναμική της, ενδέχεται να αποτελέσει την αιτία για αναπόφευκτη όσο και βίαιη αναπροσαρμογή των στρατηγικών και των προτεραιοτήτων του ιμπεριαλισμού των ΗΠΑ. Μια κατάσταση όπου η «συνέχιση της πολιτικής με άλλα μέσα» θα τείνει να γίνει κανόνας.

  Dopo la caduta
del regime fascista e la formazione del governo Badoglio a Roma erano confluite
alcune divisioni dell’esercito regio: l’8 settembre viene firmato l’armistizio,
all’alba del 9 settembre il re, Badoglio e le alte cariche militari
abbandonarono la capitale e l’esercito si trovò senza direttive. Una parte di
soldati cercò di contrastare l’esercito tedesco e, insieme a civili organizzati
dai partiti antifascisti, si attesta a Porta S. Paolo dove si resiste finchè la
soperchiante forza militare tedesca ha ragione dei resistenti.
 </span>
<p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
   Roma cade
sotto il controllo degli occupanti nazisti 
che fra il 1943 e il 1944 sottoposero la popolazione a terrore,
massacri, torture.
  </span>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
   È in questo
contesto che si inserisce l’azione di via Rasella: in quell’occasione, i Gruppi
di Azione Patriottica riuscirono in una coraggiosa operazione militare che vide
l’assalto a un battaglione nazista che marciava nelle strade del centro,
portando all’uccisione di 33 soldati delle SS. La rappresaglia nazista a questo
evento fu, come tristemente noto, il massacro delle Fosse Ardeatine in cui
trucidarono 335 prigionieri.
  </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Aptos, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin: 13.2pt 0cm;">
<span>
   Negli anni
diversi sono stati i tentativi di criminalizzare l’azione di via Rasella da
parte dei revisionisti storici - fino all’ “esternazione” di La Russa dello
scorso anno:
  </span>
<span>
<i>
<span style='font-family: "Times New Roman",serif;'>
</span>
<span>
     «Via Rasella è stata una pagina tutt’altro che nobile della
resistenza, quelli uccisi furono una banda musicale di semi-pensionati e non
nazisti delle SS, sapendo benissimo il rischio di rappresaglia su cittadini
romani, antifascisti e non».
    </span>
</i>
</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>
   Sempre,
coraggiosamente e coerentemente i gappisti protagonisti dell’azione hanno
difeso la Resistenza partigiana e contrastato i tentativi di criminalizzarli.
Essi ci hanno lasciato delle pagine memorabili sulla Resistenza romana.

   Già negli anni del liceo fu un attivo antifascista. Con Leonardo
Jannaccone, Corrado Nourian e Nino Baldini costituì, infatti, nel 1939, un
gruppo detto di "unificazione marxista", che attirò presto
l'attenzione della polizia fascista. Arrestato nel 1941, dopo la scarcerazione
Bentivegna aderì nel 1943 al Partito comunista. Con l'armistizio e la
formazione dei Gruppi di azione patriottica, fu tra i più valorosi protagonisti
della Resistenza, sia a Roma (assalto a militari tedeschi in piazza Barberini,
attacco ad un corteo fascista in via Tomacelli) che nella zona della Casilina,
dove comandò formazioni partigiane.
   <br>
   Il 23 marzo del 1944 con
   <a href="https://www.anpi.it/donne-e-uomini/carla-capponi">

   , che mise fuori

Fosse Ardeatine. Pochi mesi dopo la liberazione della Capitale, Bentivegna
decise di continuare la sua lotta contro i nazifascisti in

   Rientrato in Italia dopo la conclusione del conflitto, questo valoroso
combattente (che per un paio d'anni fu anche redattore del giornale
   <i>

   </i>
   ,
prima di riprendere gli studi e di dedicarsi alla professione di medico), è
stato sottoposto per le sue imprese di partigiano a numerosi processi, dai

   Era ancora studente delle Commerciali quando aveva cominciato a svolgere
attività clandestina in "Giustizia e Libertà" e nel Partito
comunista. Dopo il 25 luglio del '43, diede vita, con altri antifascisti
romani, alla formazione "Arditi del Popolo". Il 9 settembre
Fiorentini prese parte ai combattimenti contro i tedeschi a Porta San Paolo e
nell'ottobre del '43 formò e diresse i Gap centrali "

di "Giovanni", operando nella IV Zona di Roma. In questo ruolo
partecipò, nella Capitale, a numerose azioni, tra cui quelle di via Rasella e
al carcere di Regina Coeli. Dopo la liberazione di Roma, si fece paracadutare
al Nord. Col nome di battaglia di "Dino" operò in Liguria, Emilia,
Lombardia e Piemonte, come ufficiale di collegamento dell'OSS, il servizio
segreto americano. È stato decorato con tre medaglie d'argento al valor
militare e tre croci di guerra al merito, e con la medaglia della Special Force

Fiorentini è così diventato docente di Geometria superiore all'Università di
Ferrara. I suoi studi di matematica sono stati ripresi e approfonditi in tutto
il mondo ed hanno fatto dell'ex gappista un matematico di fama internazionale.

   Studentessa di Legge, subito dopo l'8 settembre 1943 partecipò
coraggiosamente alla Resistenza romana, divenendo presto vice comandante di una
formazione operante a Roma e in provincia. Nell'ottobre del 1943 per procurarsi
un'arma (i suoi compagni dei GAP gliela negavano, perché preferivano riservare
alle donne funzioni di appoggio), non trova di meglio che rubare la pistola a
un milite della Gnr, che si trovava vicino a lei in un autobus superaffollato.
Nella primavera del 1944 è tra gli organizzatori e gli esecutori dell'azione
gappista di via Rasella contro un contingente dell'esercito tedesco. L'azione
fu poi presa dai nazisti a pretesto per la feroce strage delle Fosse Ardeatine.
Riconosciuta partigiana combattente con il grado di capitano, è stata decorata
di Medaglia d'Oro al valore militare per aver partecipato, si legge tra l'altro
nella motivazione, "alle più eroiche imprese nella caccia senza quartiere
che il suo gruppo di avanguardia dava al nemico annidato nella cerchia abitata
della città di Roma". Più volte parlamentare del PCI, membro della
Commissione Giustizia nei primi anni settanta, ha fatto parte sino alla morte
del Comitato di presidenza dell'ANPI. Poco prima della scomparsa di Carla
Capponi, "il Saggiatore" ha pubblicato un suo volume sull'attività
dei GAP a Roma. Si intitola

     Lavoratori migranti sfruttati e maltrattati
 nei vigneti piemontesi dedicati al vino pregiato. La denuncia arriva 
direttamente da Al Jazeera, la rete con sede in Qatar. Più nello 
specifico nell’articolo intitolato “Migrant workers exploited, abused in
 Italy’s prized fine wine vineyards”, dove si racconta, tra le altre, la
 storia di
     <b>
      Sajo, un 36enne del Gambia
     </b>
     . Secondo la sua testimonianza sarebbero diversi i lavoratori privi di documenti che lavorano per 12 ore
     <b>
      nei vigneti di Barolo e Barbaresco
     </b>
     (dove
 un ettaro fino a 1,5 milioni il prezzo di un ettaro), per una paga che 
va dai 3 ai 4 euro l’ora. Non solo. L’uomo denuncia anche diversi 
episodi di razzismo, oltre a condizioni di lavoro definite “disumane”.

     Sajo afferma di aver
     <b>
      trovato lavoro ad Alba
     </b>
     ,
 durante la stagione dell’uva, quando occorre nuova forza lavoro. Appena
 sceso dal treno venne avvicinato da un uomo, che gli offrì
     <b>
      un lavoro nei vigneti con una paga di 3 euro l’ora
     </b>
     .
 Accettò e si stabilì in un piccolo accampamento improvvisato che altri

     «È stato il momento più difficile da quando
 ho lasciato il Gambia – ricorda Sajo - non riuscivo nemmeno a 
ricaricare il telefono per chiamare casa». Ogni giorno si svegliava 
prima dell'alba e andava alla stazione dei treni,
     <b>
      dove un caporale caricava lui
     </b>
     e gli altri su un furgone e li portava sulle colline fino ai vigneti.
     <b>
      Gli operai erano costantemente sorvegliati
     </b>
     e
 «non potevamo fare pause per andare in bagno o bere acqua. Ci 
minacciavano di licenziarci se avessimo rallentato o avessimo parlato».

<br/>
  In our long history of people's democratic struggle, 23rd March hold a specific revolutionary place in the
  <br/>
  history of class struggle for all those hearts that beats for a just - equitable society, and at the same time that
  <br/>
  despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the
  <br/>
  British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the
  <br/>
  success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to
  <br/>
  the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat
  <br/>
  Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we
  <br/>
  have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded
  <br/>
  with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly
  <br/>
  opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including
  <br/>
  Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack
  <br/>
  the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them
  <br/>
  and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.
  <br/>
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br/>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire
  <br/>
  economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and
  <br/>
  native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br/>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their
  <br/>
  Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and
  <br/>
  displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to
  <br/>
  face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces,
  <br/>
  Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure
  <br/>
  was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more
  <br/>
  and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly
  <br/>
  implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to
  <br/>
  the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India,
  <br/>
  Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro-
  <br/>
  imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over
  <br/>
  the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country
  <br/>
  through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and
  <br/>
  communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today
  <br/>
  the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br/>
  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out
  <br/>
  from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has
  <br/>
  abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the
  <br/>
  resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of
  <br/>
  India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the
  <br/>
  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green-
  <br/>
  Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous
  <br/>
  people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis
  <br/>
  ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive
  <br/>
  deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from
  <br/>
  the Adivasi region. People's resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are
  <br/>
  being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP'S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific
  <br/>
  news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until
  <br/>
  and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid
  <br/>
  on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has
  <br/>
  developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the
  <br/>
  people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this
  <br/>
  enemy's machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and
  <br/>
  women's organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists
  <br/>
  to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct
  <br/>
  seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the
  <br/>
  treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

     Nella
 centralissima via Indipendenza di Bologna la polizia oggi ha caricato e
 spintonato gli studenti universitari da giorni in mobilitazione.

<span>
     Ieri
 a Bologna gli studenti universitari avevano protestato davanti al 
Senato Accademico per chiedere la fine della censura nei confronti di 
chi si mobilita contro la guerra in Palestina, per pretendere il 
boicottaggio degli accordi con Israele ed il comparto militare 
industriale.

</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Il
 Senato Accademico si è rifiutato di rescindere gli accordi in ambito 
militare e bellico, esprimendosi invece con l’ennesima formula vaga e 
fumosa, ribadendo sostanzialmente la necessità di rispettare le 
normative ed il codice etico che, per quanto riguarda il dual use, si 
limita a “minimizzare eventuali danni”…
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Vogliamo
 e pretendiamo un impegno concreto dell’Università che vada a rescindere
 tutti gli accordi con il Gruppo Leonardo, con la NATO e con i partner 
del governo sionista di Israele” hanno scritto in un comunicato gli 
studenti di Cambiare Rotta dell’ateneo bolognese.
    </span>

</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
   “
   <span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Le
 mobilitazioni nel nostro Paese dimostrano che ottenere il boicottaggio è
 possibile e possiamo farlo solo tramite la lotta, come è successo ieri 
al Senato Accademico dell’Università di Torino, dove grazie alla 
mobilitazione si è riusciti ad ottenere la non partecipazione 
dell’Ateneo torinese al nuovo bando MAECI di cooperazione tra Italia e 
Israele”.

     Ma
 oggi a Bologna è arrivata la Ministra Bernini per l’inaugurazione 
dell’anno accademico e gli studenti si sono mobilitati per farsi 
sentire, anche a luce delle dichiarazioni della ministra contro

     che hanno deciso di interrompere la collaborazione con le istituzioni israeliane.

</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
     Il
 corteo degli studenti arrivato a via Indipendenza ha cercato di 
raggiungere la sede del Teatro Manzoni dove si svolgeva la cerimonia con
 la ministra Bernini, ma ha trovato a fronteggiarlo uno schieramento 
della polizia che ben presto è passato alle vie di fatto caricando e 
spintonando gli studenti. Il corteo ha ricompattato le file e si è 
diretto in zona universitaria.
    </span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<p align="left">
<span>
<span style="font-family: Liberation Serif, serif;">
<span>
<span>
      La
 protesta si è palesata anche all’interno del teatro dove era presente 
un gruppo di studenti con la bandiera della Palestina. Francesca 
rappresentante del Consiglio studentesco, è intervenuta poco prima 
dell’intervento della ministro dell’università, Anna Maria Bernini, con 
la kefiah al collo. “Da mesi assistiamo alla censura sistemica delle 
voci provenienti dalla comunità palestinese e di quelle che sono le 
richieste delle mobilitazioni studentesche” ha denunciato la 
studentessa.

  Trupe NATO pakta, zajedno sa svojim političkim štabovima nalaze se na teritoriji Jugoslavije, rasporedjene u BiH, Hrvatskoj i Makedoniji.
 </p>
<p>
  NATO pakt su stvorili američki imperijalisti u saradnji sa imperijalistima Zapadne Evrope 1947. godine. Zabrinuti zbog velikih pobeda Sovjetskog Saveza, stvaranja socijalističkog tabora, pobeda Crvene armije u Kini i sve moćnijeg antikolonijalnog i antiimperijalističkog pokreta u zemljama Trećeg sveta, stvorili su NATO pakt kao agresivni vojni blok protiv Sovjetskog Saveza, Kine i oslobodilačkih pokreta u kolonijama. Od samog početka svog stvaranja on se formirao kao udarna vojna pesnica koja je trebalo da vojnički pobedi Sovjetski Saveza i druge socijalističke zemlje i da u njima restaurira kapitalizam. Poznate su direktne intervencije NATO­-a u Vijetnamu, Latinskoj Americi i Africi.
 </p>
<p>
  Krajem osamdesetih godina raspao se Sovjetski Savez i raspušten je Varšavski pakt, a zemlje u sastavu Sovjetskog Saveza, kao i zemlje Istočne Evrope likvidirale su socijalizam i pošle putem restauracije kapitalizma.

</figure>
<p>
  Kada je nestao glavni protivnik NATO pakta – Varšavski pakt, izgledalo je da bi bilo normalno da se raspusti i NATO pakt. Umesto toga, NATO pakt je još više pojačan, preoružan novim, najsavršenijim vrstama oružja i povećani su vojni budžeti članica NATO pakta. Upotrebljavajući ekonomski, diplomatski, politički i vojni pritisak čini sve da se proširi, ne samo na sve zemlje Istočne Evrope, nego i na sve države bivšeg Sovjetskog Saveza i tako dopre do granica Rusije. Cilj im je da na taj način Rusiju potpuno izoluju, stave je na kolena i od nje i zemalja bivšeg Sovjetskog Saveza stvore neku vrstu polukolonija, da nesmetano koriste njihova ogromna prirodna bogatstva, da steknu obilje jeftine radne snage i prostrano tržište. Očigledno je da je NATO pakt ostao i dalje agresivna vojna sila imperijalizma i da čini sve kako bi, ne samo ekonomskim i finansijskim sredstvima, već i vojnom silom NATO­-a osigurao vladavinu imperijalizma u čitavom svetu.
 </p>
<p>
  NATO pakt je reakcionarna vojna sila američkog imperijalizma, najopasniji neprijatelj socijalizma i naroda zemalja Trećeg sveta.
 </p>
<p>
  Zašto su došle trupe NATO pakta u Jugoslaviju?
 </p>
<p>
  SAD i NATO pakt su posle propasti Sovjetskog Saveza ostale jedina supersila, jedina globalna sila u svetu. Jedan od strateških ciljeva SAD i NATO pakta je da ne dozvole da dogadjaji u svetu izmaknu njihovoj kontroli i da počnu da se razvijaju mimo njihovog uticaja ili protiv njih. Oni su nekoliko godina mirno posmatrali rat u Sloveniji, Hrvatskoj, a pogotovo u BiH i nisu smatrali za potrebu da intervenišu. Medjutim, oni su zaključili da bi nastavak rata u BiH neminovno vodio njegovom proširenju na Kosovo, Makedoniju i čitav Balkan i da bi u njega ušle Turska i Grčka,dve važne clanice NATO-­a jedna protiv druge. NATO pakt je tada rešio da pošalje trupe i da zaustavi rat u BiH. Prisilili su Miloševića i Tudjmana da potpisu Dejtonski sporazum.
 </p>
<p>
  Jedan drugi elemenat je ozbiljno uticao da požure sa primenom Dejtonskog sporazuma, kao i namera da reše pitanje Kosova i omoguće duži i stabilniji mir na Balkanu. Žurba SAD i NATO je izazvana mogućnošću da uskoro “eksplodira” Turska, a sa njom čitav Bliski Istok, pa da se, eventualno, nadju u ratu sa čitavim muslimanskim svetom koji sada broji oko milijardu i sto miliona ljudi.
 </p>
<p>
  Kakav je stav Partije rada u vezi sa prisustvom NATO­a na teritoriji Jugoslavije?
 </p>
<p>
  Partija rada smatra da ovo treba razmatrati bez emocija i oceniti da li u sadasnjoj situaciji prisustvo NATO­a koristi ili šteti narodima Jugoslavije. Tim pre što je bilo slučajeva u istoriji kada su se interesi imperijalista, ukoliko se radilo o zajedničkom neprijatelju, mogli podudarati sa interesima naroda. To se desilo u drugom svetskom ratu kada je Sovjetski Savez zaključio pakt sa dve najveće imperijalističke sile tog vremena – SAD i Engleskom radi borbe protiv zajedničkog neprijatelja ­Hitlerove Nemačke.
 </p>
<p>
  U Jugoslaviji je, na žalost, nacionalizam zahvatio široke mase. Velikosrpski i velikohrvatski šovinisti su, u stvari, svojom politikom rata i ugrožavanjem globalnih interesa SAD i NATO-­a prizvali dolazak NATO u Jugoslaviju. Činjenica je da se u Jugoslaviji, baš zbog te široko rasprostranjene nacionalističke svesti, nisu mogle organizovati snage koje bi se suprotstavile pogubnoj, šovinistickoj politici Miloševica i Tudjmana. Činjenica je da nisu stigle trupe NATO-­a i silom svog oružja zaustavile rat, verovatno bi u toku ove dve godine bilo još stotine hiljada mrtvih, novih razaranja i novih zločina.
 </p>
<p>
  Sam čin zaustavljanja rata bio je pozitivan. Nastojanje da se primeni Dejtonski sporazum, osigura jedinstvena BiH, vrate sve izbeglice u svoje domove i da se kazne ratni zločinci, PR smatra interesom naroda Jugoslavije. Primena Dejtonskog sporazuma i rešavanje pitanja Kosova zadaće odsudni udarac velikosrpskoj osvajačkoj ratnoj politici, a i nacionalizmu u Jugoslaviji, koji je bio glavna podloga te politike. Zato PR u ovoj i ovakvoj situaciji za sada nije protiv prisustva NATO-­a, jer je u ovom momentu to u interesu naroda Jugoslavije.
 </p>
<p>
  Ali, ako i posle uspostavljanja mira u BiH i rešavanja ovih osnovnih problema, trupe NATO-­a budu ostale u Jugoslaviji, Partija rada će ih smatrati za okupatore, što će oni stvarno i biti. Tada će PR kao istinski patriotska partija organizovati političku i drugu borbu protiv prisustva NATO­-a, sve do oružane borbe za oslobodjenje zemlje od okupatora.

     Congreso de la CUT del 26 de febrero al 1 de marzo del 2024
    </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Hace unas semanas se realizó el VIII Congreso de la CUT en la ciudad de Bogotá, previo a este, se llevó a cabo el Congreso de Jóvenes y el de Mujeres CUT.
  </p>
<p>
   Pero ambos eventos, tanto el de los jóvenes como el de mujeres, no tuvo un carácter decisorio sino deliberativo, tuvieron además el común denominador de impedir la libre expresión a los trabajadores, sobre todo a los compañeros críticos que venían de otras ciudades y se atrevieron a cuestionar la asistencia de la viceministra de la Igualdad. La intervención de algunos jóvenes fue en el sentido de que ellos pensaban que el Congreso era para hablar de los problemas de los trabajadores y no para hacer politiquería con los funcionarios del Estado. Por esta razón fueron vetados, no solo en la plenaria, sino en las comisiones en las que trabajaron. De igual forma, en el Congreso de la Mujer, no aprobaron la resolución respecto a la defensa del pueblo palestino presentada por la compañera de Van Camps. Es decir, mientras los representantes del Estado burgués, como la viceministra de la Igualdad, sí tuvieron la palabra, a los obreros enviados por los sindicatos que cotizan y mantienen a esa burocracia no les permitieron la palabra.
  </p>
<p>
   Entre tanto, al Congreso de la CUT sí le dieron carácter decisorio y por delegados, con el agravante que llegaron los documentos ya hechos y maquinando para mostrar una mayoría que los aprobaba. Igualmente invitaron a la Ministra del Trabajo y al Viceministro, a pesar de ser criticados por los obreros de base, porque aunque fueron sindicalistas, ahora hacen parte de la las instituciones del Estado que están al servicio de los capitalistas independientemente de sus intenciones.
  </p>
<p>
   Es obvio que, si no le permiten hablar a los que se atreven a criticar, no se está ejerciendo la democracia sindical, y una supuesta mayoría aprueba las conclusiones que ya están maquinadas desde arriba. De esta manera, los nuevos delegados, sobre todo de otras ciudades, creen que esa es la forma de trabajar en el movimiento sindical, desconociendo que la democracia sindical dista demasiado de ser eso, pues a la minoría hay que permitirle defender sus posiciones.
  </p>
<p>
   Es por eso que el sindicalismo, maniatado por la ideología burguesa no le sirve a los intereses colectivos de la clase obrera, hasta ahora solo ha servido para promover a esos burócratas en puestos del Estado, ha servido para que muchos dirigentes conviertan el sindicato en su caja menor, mientras los trabajadores quedan huérfanos y a merced de lo que quieran hacer los patrones con ellos.
  </p>
<p>
   Es por ello que desde estas páginas venimos denunciando esa política burguesa de conciliación y concertación de clases, que precisamente son los fundamentos de la CUT.
  </p>
<p>
   En la declaración política que presentaron como conclusión final del VIII Congreso, se afirma que el aumento salarial aprobado para este año fue un logro. Seguramente ninguno de esos burócratas gana un salario mínimo, ni les toca aguantar el infierno que viven los obreros en la fabricas, ni las afugias y persecuciones que viven los maestros en manos de los rectores reaccionarios, y los empleados de las alcaldías y gobernaciones que sufren la persecución más brutal por los jefes, la mayoría de la burocracia de la CUT ya no siente lo que es vivir con un pírrico salario mínimo. Es decir, estas burocracias no representan a la mayoría como lo hacen saber, y sí engañan y maniatan a los obreros impidiéndoles organizarse con independencia de clase y construir sus propias organizaciones.
  </p>
<p>
   La declaración política de la CUT es solo un discurso más, pero lo que defienden allí es pura demagogia; esa burocracia se ha convertido en una maquinaria que no permite que desde adentro se pueda cambiar, es parecido a un Estado pequeñito, imposible de cambiar porque el Estado desde que se creó tiene como función garantizar los privilegios de las clases que poseen el poder económico, y en el caso de la CUT, desde su nacimiento quedó amarrada por la ideología y política de la burguesía, lo que la convirtió en el engendro que es hoy.
  </p>
<p>
   Es una necesidad inmediata que las organizaciones sindicales dejen de estar detrás de un oficio que pueden hacer las burocracias de las centrales sindicales. El movimiento sindical debe luchar por su organización con independencia de clase y desde las calles, con la denuncia y la protesta arrancarle a la burguesía las reivindicaciones del pueblo; pero es indispensable actuar organizada y centralizadamente, bajo unos principios que representen a su clase, que se vuelva a las huelgas de solidaridad.
  </p>
<p>
   Pero esto hay que trabajarlo a consciencia y con mucho compromiso comprendiendo que las reivindicaciones se resuelven colectivamente, organizados de verdad en federaciones independientes, que sean los cimientos de una verdadera Central Independiente por su ideología y política al servicio de los trabajadores y no de los patronos, una Central que dirija la lucha de los trabajadores en la mejora de sus condiciones, pero no para mantenerse como esclavos asalariados, sino para tener las fuerzas para luchar contra el capitalismo, contra la explotación asalariada y la construcción de una nueva sociedad, el socialismo.

     Sepelio de la mayora Carmelina Yule Paví – 20 de marzo 2024

<em>
    El día que yo muera, el día que yo no esté en el territorio, ustedes no se queden ahí, no les dé miedo a morir. Después de que estén luchando con sus manos, con su bastón, es el orgullo más grande que pueden tener, no como ellos, que son cobardes que empuñan un arma y con esa arma nos quieren intimidar, pero no, no se dejen doblegar, sean valientes, hablen
   </em>
   «, dijo María Teresa sobre el legado que les dejó su madre Carmelina.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Desde el sábado 16 de marzo se han presentado varios hechos de violencia contra la comunidad nasa en la zona rural del municipio de Toribío (Cauca), allí fue asesinada la dirigente indígena Carmelina Yule Paví, de 52 años de edad, fue herida cuando acompañaba a integrantes de la Guardia Indígena para rescatar a un menor quien había sido reclutado forzadamente por el Frente Dagoberto Ramos del Estado Mayor Central (EMC) de las disidencias de las FARC. Posteriormente la comunidad y la guardia indígena rescataron 2 niñas que habían sido secuestradas. Durante el funeral de la mayora Carmelina, fueron nuevamente víctimas de hostigamiento armado por parte del mismo grupo armado.

   </a>
</p>
<p>
   El conflicto armado genera masacres, reclutamiento forzado, es favorecido por la falta de oportunidades en la educación y en lo laboral. El abandono del campo por parte del Estado, lleva a las comunidades rurales a la pobreza; en particular los niños y jóvenes se convierten en carne de cañón, debido a la guerra por la disputa de la ganancia de los cultivos de coca, amapola y marihuana.
  </p>
<p>
   Esta guerra reaccionaria, realizada por los diferentes grupos armados como, los paramilitares, las fuerzas armadas del Estado, las disidencias de las FARC, el ELN y grupos de delincuencia común, ha costado la vida de miles de jóvenes durante décadas y aunque en el nuevo gobierno se promueva el discurso de «Paz Total», la guerra sigue en el campo, apuntando al exterminio de las comunidades.
  </p>
<p>
   Con este accionar queda demostrada la descomposición de las disidencias ya que no cuentan con una base política ennoblecida por el socialismo, que oriente su causa contra los enemigos del pueblo; por el contrario, se han convertido en un cartel más que masacra a su propio pueblo.
  </p>
<p>
   De ahí que sea justa la exigencia a que el gobierno cumpla sus promesas de generar fuentes de empleo, entregar tierras a las comunidades, brindar las condiciones para la educación gratuita y de calidad para primaria, secundaria y universidad.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Las exigencias más urgentes ante dicha situación al gobierno de Petro:
   </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Que el gobierno proteja la vida de las comunidades dentro de los territorios.
   </li>
<li>
    Tras la suspensión del Acuerdo de Cese al Fuego Bilateral y Temporal en los departamentos del Cauca, Nariño y Valle del Cauca. Lo que significa que el gobierno reanuda las acciones militares contra la disidencia de las FARC, es necesario que se dé un reconocimiento a la guardia indígena como gobierno de control territorial de todas las regiones con los derechos jurídicos, políticos estructurales y legislativos.
   </li>
<li>
    Cambiar los cultivos ilícitos por lícitos: que se legalice la producción de los cultivos de coca y marihuana ya que se han convertido en una industria donde las ganancias se la llevan los inversionistas locales y extranjeros y son las comunidades las que ponen los muertos.
   </li>
<li>
    Que se promueva la formación académica universitaria construyendo universidades en los 10 departamentos del Sur Occidente.
   </li>
<li>
    Que se generen fuentes de empleo partiendo de la producción agrícola y minera tecnificada para cuidar el medio ambiente, situación que evitaría la migración de los jóvenes a las ciudades en busca de empleo y sobre todo a no hacer parte de los grupos armados convirtiéndose en victimarios de sus propias comunidades.
   </li>
</ul>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   Rechazamos el asesinato de Carmelina.
   <br>
   No más secuestro de jóvenes, ni reclutamiento forzado.
   <br>
   Abajo la guerra contra el pueblo.
   <br>
   Ni el Estado, ni los politiqueros, Solo el Pueblo Salva al Pueblo.

<p>
  O ministro do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), Alexandre de Moraes, ordenou, na tarde de 22 de março, a prisão preventiva do tenente-coronel do Exército, Mauro Cid, após o vazamento de um áudio em que o tenente-coronel lança criticas contra o ministro, o STF e a Polícia Federal (PF). Os áudios foram publicados na íntegra na manhã de hoje pela revista do monopólio de comunicação, Veja. Pela tarde, Mauro Cid foi chamado a depor no STF e foi preso por “descumprimento de medida cautelar”. O STF ameaça ainda cancelar o acordo de delação premiada, mas deve manter a validade das provas oferecidas por Cid.
 </p>
<p>
  A ordem de prisão de Cid foi cumprida logo após a sessão de delação premiada no dia 22 de março, que durou 1h30. Cid foi acusado de “obstrução de justiça” e de “descumprimento das medidas cautelares”.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  O que dizem os áudios vazados do delator
 </h4>
<p>
  Nos áudios, o tenente-coronel acusa a PF de distorcer suas palavras, tirar as frases de contexto e ocultar alguns conteúdos das declarações intencionalmente. Ele afirma que o STF e a PF tem uma “narrativa pronta” e só querem comprová-la a qualquer custo, e que inclusive foi coagido a falar coisas que não sabia. “Eles são a lei agora. A lei acabou. O Alexandre de Moraes é a lei. Ele prende, ele solta, quando ele quiser, como ele quiser. Com Ministério Público, sem Ministério Público, com acusação, sem acusação”.
 </p>
<p>
  Em outro momento do áudio vazado, Cid afirma que “o Alexandre de Moraes já tem a sentença dele pronta, acho que essa é que é a grande verdade. Ele já tem a sentença dele pronta. Só tá esperando passar um tempo. O momento que ele achar conveniente, denuncia todo mundo, o PGR [procurador-geral da República] acata, aceita e ele prende todo mundo”. Por fim, o tenente-coronel ainda deu a entender que Moraes esconde episódios de 2022: “Eu falei daquele encontro do Alexandre de Moraes com o presidente, eles ficaram desconcertados, desconcertados. Eu falei: ‘Quer que eu fale?’”
 </p>
<p>
  No áudio, o tenente-coronel fez questão também de falar como foi o que mais se prejudicou por conta da articulação golpista de 2022, quase como o que mais se arriscou pela “causa”: “Quem mais se fodeu fui eu. Quem mais perdeu coisa fui eu. Ninguém perdeu carreira, ninguém perdeu vida financeira como eu perdi. Todo mundo já era quatro estrelas, já tinha atingido o topo, né? O presidente teve Pix de milhões, ficou milionário, né?”, disse.
 </p>

<audio controls="" src="https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Sequencia-01.mp3">
</audio>
</figure>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Mauro Cid sai perdendo, Bolsonaro sai ganhando
 </h4>
<p>
  O vazamento dos áudios, nos quais o delator alegar ter sido pressionado pelos investigadores e que as perguntas eram tendenciosas, objetivamente reforçou a posição da extrema-direita e dos aliados direitistas de Bolsonaro. Estes buscam “queimar” o ministro do STF, Alexandre de Moraes, como “parcial” para conduzir o inquérito. Sendo ou não verdade o que disse Mauro Cid, o fato é que a suspeição já está plantada. Isso não significa que juridicamente as provas sejam anuladas agora, mas, politicamente, fica fragilizado um possível mandado de prisão no curto prazo.
 </p>
<p>
  Chama a atenção, no entanto, que Mauro Cid não ganhou absolutamente nada com esse vazamento. O tenente-coronel chegou a passar mal e desmaiar ao receber a voz de prisão. Ao contrário, Bolsonaro sai ganhando. Aliados e a defesa jurídica de Bolsonaro comemoraram o acontecimento, chamando-o inclusive de “gol de placa”.
 </p>
<p>
  É impressionante como, entre os golpistas e fascistas, a deslealdade e a traição florescem como bambus após as chuvas: Mauro Cid, o delator, a que tudo indica, foi traído por seu interlocutor, que vazou o áudio que o prejudicou seriamente. Cid, porém, não pode reclamar: havia entregado informações que incriminavam Bolsonaro para se livrar da prisão. Essa gente entregam-se uns aos outros, sem se importar se eram antigos aliados. Mauro Cid traiu e foi traído. Como escreveu Shakespeare, em
  <strong>
   Júlio Cesar
  </strong>
  : um traidor morre muitas vezes antes de morrer.

<p>
  Segundo informações reveladas pela jornalista Denise Assis, do portal Brasil 247, o propósito do ex-comandante do Exército, Júlio César Arruda, ao posicionar tanques em frente ao acampamento bolsonarista no QG do Exército na noite do dia 8 de janeiro – impedindo, assim, a prisão dos “galinhas verdes” – foi proteger a filha e a esposa do ex-comandante, Eduardo Villas-Bôas. A decisão contou com o aceite de Luiz Inácio, que prevaricou junto de Arruda.
 </p>
<p>
  Já era suspeito há tempos que o acampamento em frente ao QG foi usado de base temporária para militares reacionários e familiares que tomaram parte na
  <em>
   bolsonarada
  </em>
  do 8/1, e que os tanques serviram como proteção para sua saída antes da entrada das tropas da Polícia Militar (PM). Na época, a justificativa oficial e que mais repercutiu na imprensa foi que a entrada da PM foi adiada para evitar um “banho de sangue”, uma vez que haviam “galinhas verdes” armados no acampamento que poderiam reagir. No entanto, essa não é a versão real dos fatos.
 </p>
<p>
  A verdade é que o comandante do Exército, Júlio Cesar Arruda, descobriu a presença de Maria Aparecida e Ticiana Villas-Bôas no acampamento e que as mesmas haviam participado da invasão à praça dos Três Poderes. O então comandante do Exército entrou em contato com Gustavo Henrique Dutra, comandante militar do Planalto, para armar o enfileiramento dos blindados na entrada do quartel e impedir a entrada da PM. Dutra recebeu ainda a tarefa de falar com Luiz Inácio, informá-lo e convencê-lo a suspender a ordem. Dutra falou primeiro com o general Gonçalves Dias, então ministro do GSI, e o convenceu a passar para o mandatário. Na conversa, Dutra relatou para Luiz Inácio a presença de Maria Aparecida e Ticiana, alertou o presidente de que havia risco de sublevação caso a prisão das mesmas fosse efetuada, uma vez que a figura de Villas-Bôas é unanimidade na caserna. Luiz Inácio, assim, acatou a ordem.
 </p>
<p>
  Maria Aparecida Villas-Bôas, esposa do ex-comandante, foi uma figura extremamente ativa nas articulações pela ruptura institucional. Ela visitou acampamentos com frequência, chegando a dar a entender em uma das visitas que Villas-Bôas estava com ela e foi até mesmo em uma das reuniões da cúpula militar para discutir o golpe.
 </p>
<p>
  Os fatos revelados explicitam o grau da crise militar na qual ainda está mergulhada a Nação. Afinal, se a simples prisão de familiares de um ex-comandante poderia desatar um processo de ruptura da hierarquia e disciplina na caserna, a única certeza que podemos ter é de que essa mesma hierarquia e disciplina estão extremamente fragilizadas. E, de fato, estão: as tropas não mudaram, tampouco o essencial do comando delas. Quem pode crer que o Brasil está mesmo a salvo de uma ruptura institucional, como sugerem os liberais e oportunistas?

  Na tarde do dia 20 de março, uma manifestação aconteceu no Tribunal de Justiça do Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ). Nesse dia seria realizado o julgamento em primeira instância de Diego Felipe, mototaxista e maqueiro do Hospital Universitário de UFRJ, preso injustamente em julho de 2023 pela PM sob a falsa acusação de transportar um fuzil desmontado, que estava com um passageiro transportado por Diego.

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Na ocasião, o trabalhador ficou dois meses encarcerado em um presídio no município de São Gonçalo e atualmente se encontra em liberdade provisória. Os colegas e familiares de Diego exigem o fim do julgamento contra o mototaxista e denunciando a criminalização do povo preto, pobre e periférico promovida pelo velho Estado.
 </p>
<p>
  A manifestação teve início ao meio-dia e contou com a presença de amigos e familiares de Diego, bem como de organizações democráticas como o Centro Brasileiro de Solidariedade aos Povos (Cebraspo). Na ocasião, os manifestantes ergueram cartazes e ecoaram frases como
  <strong>
   Justiça para Diego
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Mototáxi não é bandido, mexeu com ele mexeu comigo
  </strong>
<strong>
   Trabalhador não é bandido, foi a PM que matou o Amarildo
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Durante as intervenções, os familiares denunciaram o caráter racista das polícias nas constantes prisões e operações arbitrárias contra os trabalhadores moradores de favela, apontando que o caso de Diego não é uma exceção, e sim uma regra em um país onde 44,5% dos presos ainda não foram julgados, segundo dados do Conselho Nacional de Justiça (CNJ) em 2022.
 </p>
<p>
  Os manifestantes denunciaram também os dois pesos e duas medidas utilizados pela justiça do velho Estado. Enquanto processa, prende e criminaliza milhares de trabalhadores inocentes, absolve e deixa em liberdade os policiais militares que matam o povo nas favelas, como ocorreu recentemente com a absolvição dos policiais que assassinaram a trabalhadora Cláudia Ferreira.
 </p>
<p>
  O julgamento do caso de Diego foi adiado para o dia 1 de abril às 14h em decorrência do não comparecimento dos policiais que fazem parte da acusação. A família convida a todos para participarem de outro ato que ocorrerá neste dia às 12h em frente ao Tribunal de Justiça.

   A Nova Democracia reports
  </a>
  that on Tuesday, March 19, the trial of the request for acquittal of the 23 political activists persecuted for their participation in the 2013 and 2014 demonstrations took place at the Court in Rio de Janeiro.
 </p>
<p>
  The trial lasted around 20 minutes and unanimously approved the acquittal of the activists. Outside the court, popular class movements, democratic entities and associations gathered to denounce the political persecution and demand the acquittal of the 23 activists persecuted by the old State for 10 years.
 </p>
<p>
  At the event, in addition to celebrating the result of the trial, speeches were also made against the criminalization of the popular struggle currently underway, defending the people’s right to struggle for their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  The case against the 23 began in 2014, with accusations of “gang formation” and “corruption of minors”. The activists were sentenced to sentences ranging from 5 to 7 years in prison. The accusations and arrests linked to this process are part of the campaign of persecution and criminalization of the popular struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  It is worth highlighting that the criminalization of activists and young people who took to the streets to protest also included the participation of the press monopoly, which painted the young fighters as “terrorists” and “vandals”.
 </p>
<p>
  Igor Mendes, among others was imprisoned. He served almost 7 months. Several other people had to remain underground to escape the waves of arrests that were taking place.
 </p>
<p>
  During these 10 years of struggling against the absurd process, the people’s lawyers managed to completely prove the complete farce behind the accusations, which was not supported by evidence but by “testimonies” from undercover agents and other illegalities. that made up a process full of gross flaws.
 </p>
<p>
  The acquittal represents a political victory not only for the activists directly affected but also for all those who struggle, especially the youth, who dared to stand up in the heroic days of 2013 and 2014 against oppression and exploitation of the people. The outcome is also important due to the given current national situation, marked by a profound reactionarization of the State, which has been creating new laws and legal mechanisms to criminalize popular struggle and the right to demonstrate.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.

In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1.

In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions.

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3.

The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2.

The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2.

The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7.

A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held.

Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged.

Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5. The decision shall be in writing and shall contain a full and reasoned statement of the Trial Chamber's  findings on the evidence and conclusions. The Trial Chamber shall issue one decision. When there is no  unanimity, the Trial Chamber's decision shall contain the views of the majority and the minority. The  decision or a summary thereof shall be delivered in open court. Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1. In the event of a conviction, the Trial Chamber shall consider the appropriate sentence to be imposed and  shall take into account the evidence presented and submissions made during the trial that are relevant to  the sentence.  2. Except where article 65 applies and before the completion of the trial, the Trial Chamber may on its own  motion and shall, at the request of the Prosecutor or the accused, hold a further hearing to hear any  additional evidence or submissions relevant to the sentence, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence.  3. Where paragraph 2 applies, any representations under article 75 shall be heard during the further hearing  referred to in paragraph 2 and, if necessary, during any additional hearing.  4. The sentence shall be pronounced in public and, wherever possible, in the presence of the accused.<br/>38 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 7.   PENALTIES Article 77   Applicable penalties 1. Subject to article 110, the Court may impose one of the following penalties on a person convicted of a crime  referred to in article 5 of this Statute:  (a) Imprisonment for a specified number of years, which may not exceed a maximum of 30 years; or  (b) A term of life imprisonment when justified by the extreme gravity of the crime and the individual  circumstances of the convicted person. 2. In addition to imprisonment, the Court may order:  (a) A fine under the criteria provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) A forfeiture of proceeds, property and assets derived directly or indirectly from that crime, without  prejudice to the rights of bona fide third parties. Article 78   Determination of the sentence 1. In determining the sentence, the Court shall, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  take into account such factors as the gravity of the crime and the individual circumstances of the convicted  person.  2. In imposing a sentence of imprisonment, the Court shall deduct the time, if any, previously spent in  detention in accordance with an order of the Court. The Court may deduct any time otherwise spent in  detention in connection with conduct underlying the crime.  3. When a person has been convicted of more than one crime, the Court shall pronounce a sentence for each  crime and a joint sentence specifying the total period of imprisonment. This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2. The Court may order money and other property collected through fines or forfeiture to be transferred, by  order of the Court, to the Trust Fund.  3. The Trust Fund shall be managed according to criteria to be determined by the Assembly of States Parties.  Article 80   Non-prejudice to national application of penalties and national laws Nothing in this Part affects the application by States of penalties prescribed by their national law, nor the law of  States which do not provide for penalties prescribed in this Part. <br/>39 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 8.   APPEAL AND REVISION Article 81   Appeal against decision of acquittal or conviction or against sentence 1. A decision under article 74 may be appealed in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence as  follows:  (a) The Prosecutor may make an appeal on any of the following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact, or  (iii) Error of law;  (b) The convicted person, or the Prosecutor on that person's behalf, may make an appeal on any of the  following grounds:  (i) Procedural error,  (ii) Error of fact,  (iii) Error of law, or  (iv) Any other ground that affects the fairness or reliability of the proceedings or decision. 2. (a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 (a) and (b), execution of the decision or sentence shall be suspended  during the period allowed for appeal and for the duration of the appeal proceedings.

Either party may appeal any of the following decisions in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and  Evidence:  (a) A decision with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility;  (b) A decision granting or denying release of the person being investigated or prosecuted;  (c) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under article 56, paragraph 3;  (d) A decision that involves an issue that would significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of  the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and for which, in the opinion of the Pre-Trial or Trial  Chamber, an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.<br/>40 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3. If in an appeal against sentence the Appeals Chamber finds that the sentence is disproportionate to the  crime, it may vary the sentence in accordance with Part 7.  4. The judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall be taken by a majority of the judges and shall be delivered  in open court. The judgement shall state the reasons on which it is based. When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1. The convicted person or, after death, spouses, children, parents or one person alive at the time of the  accused's death who has been given express written instructions from the accused to bring such a claim, or  the Prosecutor on the person's behalf, may apply to the Appeals Chamber to revise the final judgement of  conviction or sentence on the grounds that:  (a) New evidence has been discovered that:  (i) Was not available at the time of trial, and such unavailability was not wholly or partially  attributable to the party making application; and  (ii) Is sufficiently important that had it been proved at trial it would have been likely to have  resulted in a different verdict; (b) It has been newly discovered that decisive evidence, taken into account at trial and upon which the  conviction depends, was false, forged or falsified;  (c) One or more of the judges who participated in conviction or confirmation of the charges has  committed, in that case, an act of serious misconduct or serious breach of duty of sufficient gravity to  justify the removal of that judge or those judges from office under article 46. 2. The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

(b) When appropriate, without prejudice to the provisions of subparagraph (a), requests may also be  transmitted through the International Criminal Police Organization or any appropriate regional  organization.  2. Requests for cooperation and any documents supporting the request shall either be in or be accompanied by  a translation into an official language of the requested State or one of the working languages of the Court,  in accordance with the choice made by that State upon ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.  Subsequent changes to this choice shall be made in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  3. The requested State shall keep confidential a request for cooperation and any documents supporting the  request, except to the extent that the disclosure is necessary for execution of the request.  4. In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part. Article 89   Surrender of persons to the Court 1.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.  Article 91   Contents of request for arrest and surrender 1. A request for arrest and surrender shall be made in writing.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4. The fact that the person sought has been released from custody pursuant to paragraph 3 shall not prejudice  the subsequent arrest and surrender of that person if the request for surrender and the documents  supporting the request are delivered at a later date.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7.

(c) The requested State may, on its own motion or at the request of the Prosecutor, subsequently consent  to the disclosure of such documents or information. They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j). Article 95   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of an admissibility challenge Where there is an admissibility challenge under consideration by the Court pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  requested State may postpone the execution of a request under this Part pending a determination by the Court,  unless the Court has specifically ordered that the Prosecutor may pursue the collection of such evidence pursuant  to article 18 or 19. Article 96   Contents of request for other forms of assistance under article 93 1. A request for other forms of assistance referred to in article 93 shall be made in writing.

During the consultations, the State Party shall advise the Court of the specific requirements of its national  law.  4. The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  The soldiers were responding to a call during fighting between some people connected to two rival factions of the feudal landownership. According to local media reports, there have been clashes repeatedly over land ownership in recent weeks, leaving several people dead. One man was abducted during that fighting, with the Nigerian military unable to get the man released.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not unusual that soldiers are sent to resolve conflicts in countryside, which often erupt over land or compensation for oil spills by energy companies in many Delta state communities.
 </p>
<p>
  But this time things went somehow different than usual. It is
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/top-stories/nigeria-16-soldiers-killed-in-delta-state-community-clashes/ar-BB1k5gJ4">
   reported
  </a>
  that when the soldiers from the 181 Amphibious Battalion, responded to a distress call and appeared at the scene, they were surrounded by the local youth and killed at the spot. Among the dead were a commanding officer, two majors, one captain and 12 soldiers.
 </p>
<p>
  An investigation has been opened and “a few arrests have been made while steps [are] in place to unravel the motive behind the attack,” Defense Headquarters spokesman Brigadier General Tukur Gusau said in a statement.
 </p>
<p>
  It
  <a href="https://www.herald.ng/residents-flee-as-military-recovers-15-soldiers-bodies-in-delta/">
   has been reported
  </a>
  , that the masses have now fled the area when the army was sent in to recover the mutilated corpses and to take revenge – houses were set ablaze.
 </p>
<p>
<em>
   This incident shows once more the hatred the masses feel towards the ruling big-landlord-bureaucratic system and their repressive forces and on the other hand the impotence of these to prevail the old order, as an expression of the deep crisis imperialism is sinking in.

It applies to armed conflicts that take place in the territory of a State  when there is protracted armed conflict between governmental authorities and organized armed  groups or between such groups. 3. Nothing in paragraph 2 (c) and (e) shall affect the responsibility of a Government to maintain or re- establish law and order in the State or to defend the unity and territorial integrity of the State, by all  legitimate means.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 5. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1.

(b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3. The warrant of arrest shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court for which the person's arrest is  sought; and  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes. 4.

The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by modifying or adding  to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

The Trial Chamber shall ensure that a complete record of the trial, which accurately reflects the proceedings,  is made and that it is maintained and preserved by the Registrar.  Article 65   Proceedings on an admission of guilt 1. Where the accused makes an admission of guilt pursuant to article 64, paragraph 8 (a), the Trial Chamber  shall determine whether:  (a) The accused understands the nature and consequences of the admission of guilt;  (b) The admission is voluntarily made by the accused after sufficient consultation with defence counsel;  and  (c) The admission of guilt is supported by the facts of the case that are contained in:  (i) The charges brought by the Prosecutor and admitted by the accused;  (ii) Any materials presented by the Prosecutor which supplement the charges and which the  accused accepts; and  (iii) Any other evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses, presented by the Prosecutor or the  accused. 2. Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5.

In imposing a sentence of imprisonment, the Court shall deduct the time, if any, previously spent in  detention in accordance with an order of the Court. The Court may deduct any time otherwise spent in  detention in connection with conduct underlying the crime.  3. When a person has been convicted of more than one crime, the Court shall pronounce a sentence for each  crime and a joint sentence specifying the total period of imprisonment.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall, as appropriate, apply to requests from States Parties to the Court. In  that case, the Court shall bear the ordinary costs of execution.  Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.  Article 102   Use of terms For the purposes of this Statute:  (a) "surrender" means the delivering up of a person by a State to the Court, pursuant to this Statute.

Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2.

Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3.

Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2.

When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  We have previously

   reported
  </a>
  on the war in Sudan portraying an initial analysis of the circumstances of the outbreak of the war.
 </p>
<p>
  Nearly one year afterwards the situation is sharpening. It is
  <a href="https://monde-diplomatique.de/artikel/!5987031">
   reported
  </a>
  , that the war-actions dramatically increased, due to massive arming of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) by the United Arab Emirates on the one hand and the “government’s” Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) by Egypt. It is
  <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2024/03/sudans-forgotten-war-new-diplomatic-push-needed">
   said
  </a>
  , that around eight million people are displaced inside the country as well as being forced to fled into neighboring countries additional to around 3 million refugees resulting from previous conflicts. Half the territory is controlled by either the RSF or the SAF. The government fled the capital Khartoum to Port Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  Negotiation attempts failed or resulted in non-lasting cease-fires. Since these failures international organization focus on the supply with humanitarian aid.
 </p>
<p>
  Now the battle is for centered around El Fasher, the capital of the region North Darfur, after the RSF was able to conquer Nyala, al-Dshunaina and Zalingei three of five regional capitals in Darfur region. In El Fasher around 1.5 million people live, one third being internal refugees. The outcomes of the battle on El Fasher seems to become a turning point in the ongoing war.
 </p>
<p>
  While the burden lies on the masses of the peoples in Sudan, foreigners are profiting. In this aspects one can consider Egypt as the Yankees handyman, while the UAE seems to be a Russian proxy in Sudan, as most

<p>
  In this sense the development of “DP World” is noteworthy. It was founded 25 years ago by the UAE state monopoly “Dubai World” as a maritime transport company. DP World started in 2016 to construct and run ports in Eastern Africa. First in Somaliland and Puntland, then in Senegal, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In October 2023 DP World took over the port of Daressalam in Tanzania for 250 million US-Dollar.
 </p>
<p>
  The UAE via its DP World was heading for the same port as the Russians – Port Sudan. So the UAE and the Russian mercenaries of the Wagner Group made up a joint-venture. Wagner transported arms paid for by the UAE with its troops in the Central African Republic to the RSF in Sudan. Since the Prigozhin incident and the restructuring of Wagner – we

  – things became even more complicated. According to Le Mode Diplomatique today two different Russian groups are involved in arming the RSF. But the Kremlin is striving to overcome these issues by its new Africa Corps.

  Due to the difficult situation with Wagner the UAE brought Libyan Chalifa Haftar in to play. Haftar organized air cargo from Bengasi to North-Western-Darfur. Additionally air-drops of weapons with parachutes were delivered.

  relations with the UAE were at an all-time high during his first visit to the Middle East since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Putin praised cooperation between the two countries as he met President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi in early December 2023, describing the UAE as “Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.” For the UAE, the strong ties with Russia is a “calculated risk” it is willing to take, a top UAE official

  On the other side the SAF are supplied via the sea to their residence in Port Sudan by Egypt. Egypt also directly intervened in the conflict, bombarding a Nile-River-Bridge in Khartoum in August 2023. Hundreds of Egyptian soldiers have been captured by the RSF and bombings of RSF positions by Egyptian fighter jets are reported,

  In this situation the scenario tends towards a complete collapse of central government, what will boost the current explosive situation at the Horn of Africa even more. On the 8
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March, the UN Security Council, aware of this situation, adopted a UK-drafted resolution calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Sudan during the month of Ramadan, a sustainable resolution to the conflict through dialogue, compliance with international humanitarian law and unhindered humanitarian access.
 </p>
<p>
  The UN Secretary-General, the UN Security Council, the African Union, and the League of Arab States joined forces to call for this Ramadan truce but Ramadan has started with further fierce fighting. Ali Karti, the Secretary-General of Sudan’s Islamic Movement has now announced that a truce with the RSF will never be accepted.
 </p>
<p>
  On top of the death and misery the war itself causes Sudan is on track to becoming the world’s largest hunger crisis, with around 18 million people already facing acute food insecurity, according to a
  <a href="https://sudantribune.com/article283302/">
   report
  </a>
  by the United Nations. 220,000 severely malnourished children could reportedly die in the upcoming months if they do not receive urgent assistance. A total of some 3.7 million children suffer from malnutrition in Sudan.
 </p>
<p>
  The perspective is quite horrible. The UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan for Sudan is only 4 per cent funded. Both RSF and SAF used hunger as a weapon of war. The RSF has looted humanitarian warehouses and besieged cities. The SAF-controlled Humanitarian Aid Commission has systematically banned movement of lifesaving aid to RSF-controlled areas.
 </p>
<p>
  The recent fighting is very likely to damage the spring harvest, which will increase the hunger even more. Also adequate medical treatment is seldom since prices of medics sky-rocketed by 600 per cent.
 </p>
<p>
  The armed conflict in Sudan, driven forward by the Imperialist puppeteers, will continue to great even more disorder in a region tarnished by war.

It applies to armed conflicts that take place in the territory of a State  when there is protracted armed conflict between governmental authorities and organized armed  groups or between such groups. 3. Nothing in paragraph 2 (c) and (e) shall affect the responsibility of a Government to maintain or re- establish law and order in the State or to defend the unity and territorial integrity of the State, by all  legitimate means.

Amendments to the Elements of Crimes may be proposed by:  (a) Any State Party;  (b) The judges acting by an absolute majority;  (c) The Prosecutor.  Such amendments shall be adopted by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Assembly of States  Parties.  3. The Elements of Crimes and amendments thereto shall be consistent with this Statute.

Article 11   Jurisdiction ratione temporis 1. The Court has jurisdiction only with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute. 2. If a State becomes a Party to this Statute after its entry into force, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction only  with respect to crimes committed after the entry into force of this Statute for that State, unless that State  has made a declaration under article 12, paragraph 3.  Article 12   Preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction 1. A State which becomes a Party to this Statute thereby accepts the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to  the crimes referred to in article 5.  2. In the case of article 13, paragraph (a) or (c), the Court may exercise its jurisdiction if one or more of the  following States are Parties to this Statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court in accordance with  paragraph 3:  (a) The State on the territory of which the conduct in question occurred or, if the crime was committed  on board a vessel or aircraft, the State of registration of that vessel or aircraft;  (b) The State of which the person accused of the crime is a national. 3. If the acceptance of a State which is not a Party to this Statute is required under paragraph 2, that State  may, by declaration lodged with the Registrar, accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court with respect  to the crime in question. The accepting State shall cooperate with the Court without any delay or exception  in accordance with Part 9. 4 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>9 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 13   Exercise of jurisdiction The Court may exercise its jurisdiction with respect to a crime referred to in article 5 in accordance with the  provisions of this Statute if:  (a) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by a State Party in accordance with article 14;  (b) A situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have been committed is referred to the  Prosecutor by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations; or  (c) The Prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such a crime in accordance with article 15. Article 14   Referral of a situation by a State Party 1. A State Party may refer to the Prosecutor a situation in which one or more crimes within the jurisdiction  of the Court appear to have been committed requesting the Prosecutor to investigate the situation for the  purpose of determining whether one or more specific persons should be charged with the commission of  such crimes.  2. As far as possible, a referral shall specify the relevant circumstances and be accompanied by such supporting  documentation as is available to the State referring the situation.  Article 15   Prosecutor 1. The Prosecutor may initiate investigations proprio motu  on the basis of information on crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The Prosecutor shall analyse the seriousness of the information received. For this purpose, he or she  may seek additional information from States, organs of the United Nations, intergovernmental or non- governmental organizations, or other reliable sources that he or she deems appropriate, and may receive  written or oral testimony at the seat of the Court.  3. If the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, he or she  shall submit to the Pre-Trial Chamber a request for authorization of an investigation, together with any  supporting material collected. Victims may make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber, in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. If the Pre-Trial Chamber, upon examination of the request and the supporting material, considers that  there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, and that the case appears to fall within the  jurisdiction of the Court, it shall authorize the commencement of the investigation, without prejudice to  subsequent determinations by the Court with regard to the jurisdiction and admissibility of a case.  5. The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information. This shall not preclude the Prosecutor from considering further  information submitted to him or her regarding the same situation in the light of new facts or evidence.  Article 15 bis5  Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, proprio motu ) 1. The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs  (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article. 2.

The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from  an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it  does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a  declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years. 5. In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the  crime of aggression when committed by that State’s nationals or on its territory. 6. Where the Prosecutor concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation in  respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made  a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8. Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may  proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has  authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with  the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance  with article16. 9. A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 10. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5.

A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the  Court’s own findings under this Statute. 5. This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other  crimes referred to in article 5. Article 16   Deferral of investigation or prosecution No investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this Statute for a period of 12  months after the Security Council, in a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations,  has requested the Court to that effect; that request may be renewed by the Council under the same conditions.  Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1. Except as provided in this Statute, no person shall be tried before the Court with respect to conduct which  formed the basis of crimes for which the person has been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  2. No person shall be tried by another court for a crime referred to in article 5 for which that person has  already been convicted or acquitted by the Court.  3. No person who has been tried by another court for conduct also proscribed under article 6, 7, 8 or 8 bis shall  be tried by the Court with respect to the same conduct unless the proceedings in the other court:  (a) Were for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within  the jurisdiction of the Court; or  (b) Otherwise were not conducted independently or impartially in accordance with the norms of due  process recognized by international law and were conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances,  was inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice. Article 21   Applicable law 1. The Court shall apply:  (a) In the first place, this Statute, Elements of Crimes and its Rules of Procedure and Evidence;  (b) In the second place, where appropriate, applicable treaties and the principles and rules of international  law, including the established principles of the international law of armed conflict;  (c) Failing that, general principles of law derived by the Court from national laws of legal systems of the  world including, as appropriate, the national laws of States that would normally exercise jurisdiction  over the crime, provided that those principles are not inconsistent with this Statute and with  international law and internationally recognized norms and standards. 2. The Court may apply principles and rules of law as interpreted in its previous decisions.  3. The application and interpretation of law pursuant to this article must be consistent with internationally  recognized human rights, and be without any adverse distinction founded on grounds such as gender as  defined in article 7, paragraph 3, age, race, colour, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion,  national, ethnic or social origin, wealth, birth or other status.  7 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (inserting the reference to article 8 bis).<br/>14 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 3.   GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW Article 22   Nullum crimen sine lege 1. A person shall not be criminally responsible under this Statute unless the conduct in question constitutes,  at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.  2. The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose. Such contribution shall be intentional and shall either:  (i) Be made with the aim of furthering the criminal activity or criminal purpose of the group,  where such activity or purpose involves the commission of a crime within the jurisdiction of  the Court; or  (ii) Be made in the knowledge of the intention of the group to commit the crime;  (e) In respect of the crime of genocide, directly and publicly incites others to commit genocide;  (f) Attempts to commit such a crime by taking action that commences its execution by means of a  substantial step, but the crime does not occur because of circumstances independent of the person's  intentions. However, a person who abandons the effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevents  the completion of the crime shall not be liable for punishment under this Statute for the attempt to  commit that crime if that person completely and voluntarily gave up the criminal purpose. 8 As amended by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010 (adding paragraph 3 bis).<br/>15 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court3 bis. In respect of the crime of aggression, the provisions of this article shall apply only to persons in a position  effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. 4. No provision in this Statute relating to individual criminal responsibility shall affect the responsibility of  States under international law.  Article 26   Exclusion of jurisdiction over persons under eighteen The Court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged  commission of a crime.  Article 27   Irrelevance of official capacity 1. This Statute shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution. Article 29   Non-applicability of statute of limitations The crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be subject to any statute of limitations.  Article 30   Mental element 1. Unless otherwise provided, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent and knowledge.  2. For the purposes of this article, a person has intent where:  (a) In relation to conduct, that person means to engage in the conduct; <br/>16 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) In relation to a consequence, that person means to cause that consequence or is aware that it will  occur in the ordinary course of events. 3. For the purposes of this article, "knowledge" means awareness that a circumstance exists or a consequence  will occur in the ordinary course of events. "Know" and "knowingly" shall be construed accordingly. Article 31   Grounds for excluding criminal responsibility 1. In addition to other grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for in this Statute, a person shall  not be criminally responsible if, at the time of that person's conduct:  (a) The person suffers from a mental disease or defect that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate  the unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform  to the requirements of law;  (b) The person is in a state of intoxication that destroys that person's capacity to appreciate the  unlawfulness or nature of his or her conduct, or capacity to control his or her conduct to conform to the  requirements of law, unless the person has become voluntarily intoxicated under such circumstances  that the person knew, or disregarded the risk, that, as a result of the intoxication, he or she was likely  to engage in conduct constituting a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (c) The person acts reasonably to defend himself or herself or another person or, in the case of war  crimes, property which is essential for the survival of the person or another person or property which  is essential for accomplishing a military mission, against an imminent and unlawful use of force  in a manner proportionate to the degree of danger to the person or the other person or property  protected. The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1.

(b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4.

At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3. The warrant of arrest shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court for which the person's arrest is  sought; and  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes. 4.

The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by modifying or adding  to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

The Trial Chamber shall ensure that a complete record of the trial, which accurately reflects the proceedings,  is made and that it is maintained and preserved by the Registrar.  Article 65   Proceedings on an admission of guilt 1. Where the accused makes an admission of guilt pursuant to article 64, paragraph 8 (a), the Trial Chamber  shall determine whether:  (a) The accused understands the nature and consequences of the admission of guilt;  (b) The admission is voluntarily made by the accused after sufficient consultation with defence counsel;  and  (c) The admission of guilt is supported by the facts of the case that are contained in:  (i) The charges brought by the Prosecutor and admitted by the accused;  (ii) Any materials presented by the Prosecutor which supplement the charges and which the  accused accepts; and  (iii) Any other evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses, presented by the Prosecutor or the  accused. 2. Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

In case of doubt as to the application of this paragraph, the Court  shall decide.  Article 68   Protection of the victims and witnesses and their participation in the proceedings 1. The Court shall take appropriate measures to protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being,  dignity and privacy of victims and witnesses. In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes. These measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a  fair and impartial trial.  2.

This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations. The Presidency may, on a case-by-case basis, designate, as available, one or more alternate  judges to be present at each stage of the trial and to replace a member of the Trial Chamber if that member  is unable to continue attending.  2. The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges. The Court may base its decision only on evidence submitted and discussed before it at the  trial.  3. The judges shall attempt to achieve unanimity in their decision, failing which the decision shall be taken by  a majority of the judges.  4. The deliberations of the Trial Chamber shall remain secret.  5.

In imposing a sentence of imprisonment, the Court shall deduct the time, if any, previously spent in  detention in accordance with an order of the Court. The Court may deduct any time otherwise spent in  detention in connection with conduct underlying the crime.  3. When a person has been convicted of more than one crime, the Court shall pronounce a sentence for each  crime and a joint sentence specifying the total period of imprisonment.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

When there is no unanimity, the  judgement of the Appeals Chamber shall contain the views of the majority and the minority, but a judge  may deliver a separate or dissenting opinion on a question of law.  5. The Appeals Chamber may deliver its judgement in the absence of the person acquitted or convicted. Article 84   Revision of conviction or sentence 1.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

In relation to any request for assistance presented under this Part, the Court may take such measures,  including measures related to the protection of information, as may be necessary to ensure the safety or  physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses and their families. The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

States  Parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Part and the procedure under their national law,  comply with requests for arrest and surrender. <br/>43 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. Where the person sought for surrender brings a challenge before a national court on the basis of the  principle of ne bis in idem  as provided in article 20, the requested State shall immediately consult with  the Court to determine if there has been a relevant ruling on admissibility. If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8.

However, the person may consent to  surrender before the expiration of this period if permitted by the law of the requested State. In such a case,  the requested State shall proceed to surrender the person to the Court as soon as possible.  4.

In the  consultations, consideration should be given to whether the assistance can be rendered in another manner  or subject to conditions. If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4. In accordance with article 72, a State Party may deny a request for assistance, in whole or in part, only if the  request concerns the production of any documents or disclosure of evidence which relates to its national  security.  5. Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6.

The provisions of this article shall, where applicable, also apply in respect of a request for assistance made  to the Court. <br/>48 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 97   Consultations Where a State Party receives a request under this Part in relation to which it identifies problems which may  impede or prevent the execution of the request, that State shall consult with the Court without delay in order to  resolve the matter. Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1. The ordinary costs for execution of requests in the territory of the requested State shall be borne by that  State, except for the following, which shall be borne by the Court:  (a) Costs associated with the travel and security of witnesses and experts or the transfer under article 93  of persons in custody;  (b) Costs of translation, interpretation and transcription;  (c) Travel and subsistence costs of the judges, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutors, the Registrar, the  Deputy Registrar and staff of any organ of the Court;  (d) Costs of any expert opinion or report requested by the Court;  (e) Costs associated with the transport of a person being surrendered to the Court by a custodial State;  and  (f) Following consultations, any extraordinary costs that may result from the execution of a request. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall, as appropriate, apply to requests from States Parties to the Court. In  that case, the Court shall bear the ordinary costs of execution.  Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.  Article 102   Use of terms For the purposes of this Statute:  (a) "surrender" means the delivering up of a person by a State to the Court, pursuant to this Statute.  (b) "extradition" means the delivering up of a person by one State to another as provided by treaty,  convention or national legislation.<br/>50 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 10.   ENFORCEMENT Article 103   Role of States in enforcement of sentences of imprisonment 1. (a) A sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the Court from a list of States  which have indicated to the Court their willingness to accept sentenced persons.  (b) At the time of declaring its willingness to accept sentenced persons, a State may attach conditions to  its acceptance as agreed by the Court and in accordance with this Part.  (c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4. If no State is designated under paragraph 1, the sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a prison  facility made available by the host State, in accordance with the conditions set out in the headquarters  agreement referred to in article 3, paragraph 2. In such a case, the costs arising out of the enforcement of a  sentence of imprisonment shall be borne by the Court.  Article 104   Change in designation of State of enforcement 1. The Court may, at any time, decide to transfer a sentenced person to a prison of another State.  2. A sentenced person may, at any time, apply to the Court to be transferred from the State of enforcement.  Article 105   Enforcement of the sentence 1. Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

The Assembly shall adopt its own rules of procedure.  10. The official and working languages of the Assembly shall be those of the General Assembly of the United  Nations. <br/>54 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART  12.

    Nun sollen wir ein Jahr auf Kurzarbeit angemeldet werden, das heißt wir bekommen nun zehn Prozent weniger Lohn. In den Nachrichten stand überall, dass wir das angeblich auf freiwilliger Basis machen würden, jetzt müssen wir aber eine Betriebsvereinbarung unterschreiben. In den Nachrichten stand auch, dass es keine Kündigungen gibt. Dennoch mussten jetzt 100 Kollegen, die in Leiharbeit waren, gehen. Insgesamt sind wir 1.000 Kollegen, die jetzt zehn Prozent weniger Lohn bekommen. Unsere Miete, der Einkauf, die Versicherungen werden aber nicht um 10 Prozent billiger!

     Korrespondenzen sind Beiträge aus verschiedenen Teilen der Bevölkerung, sozusagen ein direktes Sprachrohr aus dem Volk. Ihre Gemeinsamkeit ist, dass die jeweiligen Korrespondenten direkt aus ihrem alltäglichen Leben berichten: aus dem Betrieb, dem Viertel, der Familie, der Schule, usw… Als Presse aus dem Volk, drückt die revolutionäre und demokratische Presse nicht nur die Interessen des Großteils der Bevölkerung aus, sondern bindet deren Repräsentantinnen und Repräsentanten auch aktiv ein, gibt ihnen eine Stimme, präsentiert die verschiedenen Meinungen und Ideen aus den Massen um sie miteinander vergleichen zu können und in Diskussion treten zu lassen. Daher finden in der Roten Fahne die Arbeiterinnen und Arbeiter, Stimmen der Jugend- und Frauenbewegung, der Studierenden, der Gewerkschaftskräfte, der Migrantinnen und Migranten ebenso wie der kleinen Selbstständigen und Gewerbetreibenden, Stimmen aus Stadt und Land, eine Plattform und ein Organ. Die Korrespondenten sind keine Redaktionsmitglieder, weshalb sie auch nicht im engeren Sinne an die Blattlinie gebunden sind, sondern “ihre Stimme” zum Ausdruck bringen.

   Εκατοντάδες συγκεντρώθηκαν και ανταποκρίθηκαν στο κάλεσμα των πρωτοβάθμιων σωματείων και των συλλογικοτήτων ενάντια στις διώξεις χθες Πέμπτη 21/3 το απόγευμα στη Πλατεία Δημοτικού Θεάτρου στον Πειραιά. Στις 18:30 ξεκίνησαν οι ομιλίες από εκπροσώπους σωματείων, από διωκόμενους αγωνιστές και από συλλογικότητες.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="white-space: normal;">
<span style="white-space: pre;">
</span>
   Στην συνέχεια εκπαιδευτικοί, φοιτητές, εργαζόμενοι και νεολαίοι διαδήλωσαν από κοινού στους δρόμους του Πειραιά και φώναξαν συνθήματα ενάντια στην κρατική τρομοκρατία, τη βιομηχανία συνδικαλιστικών διώξεων, την καταστολή των αγώνων, των σωματείων, το χτύπημα στο δικαίωμα στην απεργία.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
  Βασικά συνθήματα που φωνάζονταν:
 </p>
<p>
<i>
   «Ούτε βήμα πίσω, καμιά υποταγή, στον δρόμο θα τσακίσουμε την καταστολή
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>

  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>

  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>
<i>
   Ακρίβεια ανεργία, ξεφτίλα οι μισθοί, να γιατί χρειάζονται την καταστολή
  </i>
<i>
   »
  </i>
<i>
<br>
</br></i>
<i>
   «
  </i>

   Κάτω τα χέρια από τα σωματεία, τους λαϊκούς αγώνες και την απεργία

   Ήταν μια πετυχημένη, μαχητική και μαζική διαδήλωση. Που απέδειξε ότι η απάντηση στο ζήτημα των διώξεων μπορεί και πρέπει να πάρει κινηματικά και κεντρικά χαρακτηριστικά. Άλλωστε η κυβέρνηση και το σύστημα κλιμακώνουν την επίθεση τους, με τον νέο ποινικό κώδικα, το άνοιγμα της συζήτησης για το ξεπάγωμα του νόμου Χρυσοχοΐδη για τις διαδηλώσεις, με το χτύπημα των φοιτητών καταλήψεων και με νέες διώξεις συνδικαλιστών και αγωνιστών.

  Ο αγώνας συνεχίζεται. Άλλωστε με το τέλος της διαδήλωσης ανανεώθηκε το ραντεβού με τη νέα σύσκεψη Συνδικαλιστικών Οργανώσεων &amp; Κινήσεων- Συλλογικοτήτων- Κινήσεων Γειτονιάς (Τρίτη 26/3 στις 18:30 στο 3ο ΓΕΛ Πειραιά -Μαυρομιχάλη 14-) που θα αποφασίσει τα νέα βήματα που πρέπει να γίνουν.

  Την  Πέμπτη 21/3  πραγματοποιήθηκε στο κέντρο του  Ηρακλείου συγκέντρωση καταγγελίας των διώξεων αγωνιστών εκπαιδευτικών για την πολιτική και συνδικαλιστική τους δράση στο Πειραιά αλλά και σε  άλλες πόλεις και των 49 φοιτητών του ΑΠΘ.
 </p>
<p>
  Ως Αγωνιστικές Κινήσεις των Εκπαιδευτικών προτείναμε στα σχήματα των παρεμβάσεων  στην πρωτοβάθμια και δευτεροβάθμια εκπαίδευση    να καλέσουμε την ίδια μέρα συγκέντρωση στο Ηράκλειο για το ζήτημα αυτό. Μάλιστα προτείναμε να συναντηθούμε την Παρασκευή 15/3 για να οργανώσουμε όσο γίνεται καλύτερα αυτή την συγκέντρωση. Αυτή η συνάντηση δεν έγινε για διάφορους λόγους. Η ΕΛΜΕ όχι μόνο δεν συμμετείχε   αλλά ούτε καν έβγαλε ψήφισμα. Τα επιχειρήματα των ΣΥΝΕΚ ,της ΠΕΚ και του ΠΑΜΕ  όχι  μόνο ήταν απαράδεκτα   αλλά και γελοία.
 </p>
<p>
  Τελικά χωρίς ιδιαίτερη ζύμωση και ουσιαστική παρέμβαση στα σχολεία,  έγινε η συγκέντρωση. Συμμετείχαν με πανό οι Αγωνιστικές Κινήσεις Εκπαιδευτικών, η Αριστερή Παρέμβαση, η Αριστερή Παρέμβαση Συσπείρωση και η Ταξική Πορεία.   Επίσης δεκάδες εκπαιδευτικοί και εργαζόμενοι ανταποκρίθηκαν. Στήθηκε μικροφωνική, μοιράστηκαν εκατοντάδες  προκηρύξεις και υπήρχε ένα πολύ καλό κλίμα όσο αφορά την ανταπόκριση του κόσμου. Όμως τελικά δεν  μπορέσαμε να κάνουμε διαδήλωση.
 </p>
<p>
  Θεωρούμε ότι οι αδυναμίες μας αλλά και οι δυνατότητες που φάνηκαν αρκετά καλά σε αυτή την κινητοποίηση πρέπει να απασχολήσουν όλες τις δυνάμεις που συμμετείχαμε. Αν το επόμενο διάστημα κινηθούμε πιο αποφασιστικά για το σοβαρό ζήτημα των διώξεων (και όχι μόνο)  το αποτέλεσμα θα είναι πολύ καλύτερο.

 Ετούτη η μέρα είναι καθιερωμένη από τον «ευαγή» ΟΗΕ σαν παγκόσμια ημέρα ευτυχίας. Πράγματι, τόση έγνοια για την ουσιαστική ευδαιμονία της ανθρωπότητας δεν βαστιέται. Θα λυγίσουμε από το υπερβολικό βάρος.  Άραγε το περίσσευμα της αγωνίας των καλών σαμαρείτιδων  που θα το εναποθέσουμε; Μάλλον ας το επωμιστεί  ο πρωτοκάθεδρος των αρίστων (τουλάχιστον στον βαλκανικό νοτιά) Μητσοτάκης, ώστε να ανεβάσει τη χώρα από την 64η θέση (από τις 143 συνολικά) της διεθνής κατάταξης, λίγο ψηλότερα.
 <br>
<br>
 Βέβαια όσο και να μοχθήσει άοκνα ο ευλογημένος (γιατί οπωσδήποτε κάποιοι τον ευγνωμονούν), απίθανο να πλησιάσει τη ζηλευτή τέταρτη (εκτιμήσεις προ γενοκτονίας) του Ισραήλ!!  Επιβραβεύεται όμως η προσπάθεια του, αδιάκριτα τελικού αποτελέσματος.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Έτσι λοιπόν αμολά τους ροπαλοφόρους γενίτσαρους να τσακίζουν στο ξύλο και συλλαμβάνουν  αθρόα φοιτητές, με σκοπό να κλειδώσει οριστικά τη τελευταία επιτυχία θέσπισης ιδιωτικών ανώτατων σχολών. Σαν επακόλουθο της οποίας λίαν συντόμως μέσα σε πέλαγα «ευτυχίας» θα πληρώνει ο λαός για τις σπουδές των παιδιών του (που δεν θα μπορεί δηλαδή) αλμυρότατα δίδακτρα στα δημόσια πανεπιστήμια.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Εξίσου «περιχαρείς» και καθόλου περιδεείς  θα κάνουν οι νέοι το στερνό της ζωής τους ταξίδι «αναψυχής»  με τα ιδιωτικοποιημένα και εκσυγχρονισμένα τραίνα. Θα προσφέρουν τα στρατευμένα αρσενικά το αίμα τους μέσα σε δίνη «αγαλλίασης» στα όποια πολεμικά μέτωπα προστάξει το εθνικό γόητρο και εθνικιστικό καθήκον  αγαστά αγκαλιασμένο (υποταγμένο) με τις ιμπεριαλιστικούς αμερικανονατοϊκούς μακάβριους σχεδιασμούς. Όπως ακριβώς έπραξαν «ένδοξα» οι πρόγονοι σε Κριμαία, Σαγγάριο και Κορέα.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Μέσα σε παραζάλη  «μακαριότητας»  επίσης θα κατακτούν την επουράνια αιωνιότητα αποχαιρετώντας τον μάταιο  κόσμο της ύλης (που το χριστεπώνυμο κηφηναριό της κοινωνίας απολαμβάνει σε μυθικές δοσολογίες) στην πυρά του Ματιού (επίτευγμα όχι άμεσα της τωρινής κυβέρνησης, αλλά οπωσδήποτε συστημικό) ή στους πνιγμούς της νεροποντής. Συντροφιά θα έχουν φυσικά την αθάνατη (κατά θρησκεία) ψυχή των «απρόσεχτων» σκοτωμένων εργατών στα εργοδοτικά κολαστήρια. Εκεί όπου με ασυγκράτητο «ενθουσιασμό» εξουθενώνεται ο πένητας βιοπαλαιστής για την παραγωγική ανάπτυξη του τόπου δίνοντας καρτερικά την καθημερινή μάχη με το μη καπιταλιστικό και μάλλον εξωγήινης προέλευσης  τέρας της ακρίβειας.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Αρκεί μολαταύτα να μην παρασυρθεί από δημαγωγικές, κακεντρεχείς  σειρήνες το διευθυντήριο της ολιγαρχίας λαβώνοντας οδυνηρά  την λαϊκή «ευφορία».  Η οποία πηγάζει  από την  αποκαθήλωση  της καλπάζουσας πολιτικής λαιμητόμου  των κατακτημένων απομειναριών του κράτους πρόνοιας. Με «φρικτή»  συνέπεια αντί της «λαχταριστής»  προσφυγής  στα απογευματινά χειρουργεία να υποχρεώνεται ο λαός σε αναζήτηση  … δωρεάν θεραπείας στα νοσοκομεία και σε βάρος πάντα της ιερής εξοικονόμησης πόρων. Των αναγκαίων δηλαδή  θυσιών για την αγορά αμυντικών  (η οποία άμυνα δίχως αγκυλώσεις εσωστρέφειας εξαπλώνεται θαλερά ίσαμε την Ερυθρά θάλασσα) σύνεργων «ειρηνοποιού»  θανάτου και  αισθήματος ασφάλειας … συριακής ή ιρακινής χροιάς. Τέτοιου μεγέθους μάλιστα γρανιτένια  σιγουριά, παντελώς  ακλόνητη από τους  «αστεϊσμούς» του απειλητικού Πούτιν περί πυρηνικού ολοκαυτώματος.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Το «θεσπέσιο δε κλίμα έκστασης και ανεμελιάς» του λαού εμπλουτίζεται και ολοκληρώνεται  με τα ηδονικά αναφωνητά  δωδεκάχρονων κοριτσιών, ανάμεικτα με «ευγνωμοσύνη» προς τον  μαστροπό τους. Ο οποίος με τη βούλα της ατιμωρησίας του (αστικού) νόμου τα εκδίδει «αλτρουιστικά» στους διεστραμμένους, για να κερδίζουν οι άπορες κορασίδες «ευχάριστα»  τα προς το ζην.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Δεν φτάνει που η απανταχού της γης κυριαρχία κεφαλαίου και ιμπεριαλιστών καταντά γνήσιο εφιάλτη την επιβίωση των εργατολαϊκών μαζών, παρά μας εμπαίζουν  συνάμα ασύστολα. Καθιερώνουν μέρες γιορτής  και βαφτίζουν καθεμιά από  τις 365 μαρτυρικές μέρες του χρόνου με ευφάνταστες ονομασίες. Σε μια υδρόγειο πείνας, πόνου, τρόμου και σπαραγμού.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Ακούς εκεί ευτυχία. Που άραγε και με τι κριτήρια την προσμετρούν οι φυσικοί και ηθικοί αυτουργοί των μεγαλύτερων εγκλημάτων της οικουμένης; Στα κρεματόρια  Γάζας  και Ουκρανίας ή στους σχεδόν εννέα εκατομμύρια νεκρούς σε ετήσια βάση στον πλανήτη από οξεία ασιτία;  Μήπως με τις εκατοντάδες πρόσφυγες στον βυθό Πύλου ή στα 35.000 μνήματα των αδικοχαμένων από την πανδημία μονάχα στην Ελλάδα;
 <br/>
<br/>
 Οι λαοί μια μονάχα αναστάσιμη γιορτή πρέπει να προγραμματίζουν κάθε μέρα και στιγμή. Εκείνη της αντίστασης απέναντι στη βαρβαρότητα και υποκρισία του συστήματος.  Είναι αδύνατον να πανηγυρίζουν ταυτόχρονα όλοι μαζί, αφεντικά και δούλοι. Ή οι τύραννοι θα γλεντούν την ανομολόγητη (επίσημα έστω) παραδεισένια καλοπέραση προξενώντας  στις μάζες ασφυκτικές στερήσεις, απελπισία, στυγνή καταστολή και  πολεμικά  μακελειά ή οι λαοί θα ανασαίνουν ελευθέρα,  γαλήνια,  δημιουργικά, ελπιδοφόρα στις λεωφόρους των αγώνων και επαναστατικών αναμετρήσεων.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Η ευαρέσκεια των λίγων ποδοπατά ανελέητα την ικανοποίηση των συμφερόντων της πλειοψηφίας. Ενώ η ευτυχία των πολλών προϋποθέτει την ήττα και συντριβή των ταξικών  αντίπαλων της μιας χούφτας εκμεταλλευτών. Τίποτα ενδιάμεσο δεν νοείται.

 Η υπουργός Παιδείας της Γερμανίας δηλώνει ότι τα σχολεία οφείλουν να προετοιμάσουν τους μαθητές για το ενδεχόμενο πολέμου, την ίδια στιγμή που το ντόπιο αστικό πολιτικό σύστημα χορεύει στον ρυθμό της ευρωκάλπης του Ιουνίου. Ο πρόεδρος του Ευρωπαϊκού Συμβουλίου, Σαρλ Μισέλ, διακηρύσσει ότι «αν θέλει ειρήνη, η Ευρώπη πρέπει να ετοιμαστεί για πόλεμο» και πως χρειάζεται να «περάσουμε σε λειτουργία οικονομίας πολέμου», ενώ, παράλληλα, τα ξέφτια των πάλαι ποτέ κραταιών αυταπατών και ψεμάτων για την «Ευρώπη των λαών» επιστρατεύονται ξανά από τους κυρίαρχους για να σύρουν τους λαούς τους στην επερχόμενη εκλογική φάρσα. Έτσι και εδώ, ο εγχώριος αστισμός ετοιμάζεται να φορέσει τα «δημοκρατικά» του κουστούμια, την ίδια ώρα που κάνει σχέδια για να ντύσει τον κόσμο της δουλειάς και τη νεολαία στις παραλλαγές, όποτε αυτό απαιτηθεί.
 <br>
<br>
 Γιατί εκεί ακριβώς οδηγεί η αναβάθμιση της εμπλοκής της χώρας στις εστίες αντιπαράθεσης που έχει ανάψει η παρόξυνση του ιμπεριαλιστικού ανταγωνισμού των ΗΠΑ-Δύσης με τη Ρωσία, αλλά και την Κίνα! Η συνάντηση του Μητσοτάκη με τον Ζελένσκι στην Οδησσό, κατά παραγγελία των Αμερικάνων και σε αναζήτηση ρόλων για λογαριασμό της ντόπιας άρχουσας τάξης σε πεδία που ήδη έχει κατοχυρώσει συμμετοχή η ανταγωνίστρια τουρκική, σημαδεύτηκε από τη «συμπτωματική» ρωσική πυραυλική επιδρομή μερικές εκατοντάδες μέτρα πιο δίπλα. Και οι προειδοποιητικές αναφορές του ρωσικού υπουργείου Εξωτερικών προς την Ελλάδα, που ακολούθησαν, αποτέλεσαν μια υπενθύμιση για το μέγεθος των κινδύνων που προκύπτουν από το γεγονός ότι η χώρα μετατρέπεται σε εν δυνάμει «στόχο» στο πλαίσιο της ενδοϊμπεριαλιστικής διαπάλης. Το ίδιο ισχύει και σε σχέση με την όλο και βαθύτερη ένταξη στο μέτωπο της Μέσης Ανατολής, με τη φρεγάτα «Ύδρα» να αναλαμβάνει ενεργό στρατιωτικό ρόλο στην Ερυθρά Θάλασσα στο πλαίσιο της «ευρωπαϊκής» αποστολής Aspides, κόντρα στα drones των Χούθι και προς στήριξη της σιωνιστικής γενοκτονίας του παλαιστινιακού λαού.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  The parties concerned have agreed to continue the four-party Socialist Front of Nepal.
 </p>
<p>
  Top leaders of the CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand and the CPN (Maoist Centre), all participants in the Socialist Front of Nepal, held a meeting at the Prime Minister’s Residence, Baluwatar, on Friday morning. Khadga Bahadur Bishwakarma, spokesperson for the Chand-led CPN, said that it had been agreed to continue the Socialist Front and advance the front’s programs.
 </p>
<p>
  In the same meeting, it was decided to try to get the CPN-UML to participate in the Socialist Front of Nepal. “From the beginning, our party was in favor of including other parties including the UML in the Socialist Front. However, due to the previous power coalition, UML was not accepting that,” Bishwakarma said. “Now, the environment has become easier after the change of power. Since they are also in the government, there has been a discussion about getting them to participate in the Front.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the changed situation, the parties have become hopeful that UML will participate in the Front. For this, a team including Chand, who is also the coordinator of the Socialist Front, held a two-hour conversation with UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli on Thursday. Bishwakarma said that Oli appeared positive. “He is positive. However, it is necessary to discuss some issues further,” he said.
 </p>
<p>
  “In today’s meeting, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav have been given the responsibility to further communicate with Oli,” Bishwakarma said.

<p>
  Come già abbiamo denunciato (*), il regime egiziano di Al Sisi sta facendo costruire un recinto nel deserto del Sinai per rinchiudervi i palestinesi in fuga da Gaza, e facilitare così la “pulizia etnica” da parte di Israele, in cambio di finanziamenti del Fmi.
 </p>
<p>
  Il regime egiziano è dominato dai militari, che sono anche tra i maggiori capitalisti del paese. Lanciatisi in affari “faraonici”, come la costruzione della nuova capitale (con enormi profitti per sé e per gli amici), hanno ingigantito anche il debito dello stato e ora il solo pagamento degli interessi sul debito pesa per oltre il 10% del Pil. Soluzione: stampare moneta, quindi creare inflazione, ossia tagliare il potere d’acquisto dei salari per mantenere i profitti dei padroni, privati, di stato e militari.
  <br>
  A settembre 2023 l’inflazione aveva raggiunto il 40%, ossia il potere d’acquisto dei già miseri salari e stipendi aveva subito un taglio del 40%.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Temendo il malcontento per i salari di fame anche tra i dipendenti pubblici, il governo ha decretato l’aumento del salario minimo da 4.000 a 6.000 sterline egiziane (al cambio corrente, oggi 120 euro al mese). Per i dipendenti privati, però, il salario minimo è stato portato a sole LE 3.500.
  <br>
  A gennaio, ai lavoratori che protestavano per i bassi salari, al Sisi aveva avuto la spudoratezza di rispondere: “Non mangiamo? Mangiamo. Non beviamo? Beviamo, e tutto funziona [e qui aveva fatto un osceno, irridente, paragone con la condizione dei palestinesi deliberatamente affamati e assetati dallo stato sionista – ndr.]. Le cose sono costose e alcune non sono disponibili? E allora?”.
 </br></p>
<p>
<b>
   La risposta delle lavoratrici della più grande fabbrica egiziana, il complesso tessile di MISR di Mahalla al-Kubra nel Delta del Nilo, che ha più di un secolo di storia e di lotte, è arrivata il 22 febbraio.
  </b>
<b>
   Scandendo slogan di protesta sono scese in sciopero in 3.700.
  </b>
  Nonostante l’intervento delle guardie per impedire loro di accedere al piazzale centrale, e la scesa in campo del sindacato ufficiale contro lo sciopero, lo sciopero, sostenuto da un sindacato indipendente, si è esteso ad almeno 7 mila lavoratori.
  <br>
  La risposta dei padroni e del governo è stata: bastone e carota. Salario minimo a 6.000 LE (un aumento del 70%), arresto di 13 “leader” dello sciopero (fonte: LabourStart), di cui due ancora detenuti alla data del 13 marzo, sono anche minacciati di licenziamento per assenza ingiustificata.
 </br></p>
<p>
  Evidentemente padroni e governo contano sulla prosecuzione dell’inflazione (ancora al 31% a gennaio 2024), che rimangerà gli aumenti, e gli arresti sono un avvertimento a chiunque, a Mahalla o altrove, venisse in mente di tornare alla lotta.
  <br/>
  Ma lasciar proseguire lo sciopero senza concessioni è sembrato troppo pericoloso al governo: avrebbe rischiato un’esplosione generalizzata perché sa che il forte aumento del costo della vita ha aumentato la pressione tra i lavoratori.
  <br/>
  Un’esplosione che potrebbe collegarsi al sostegno popolare alla causa palestinese che in Egitto c’è, per quanto il regime militare faccia tutto quel che può per non farlo manifestare, e al più generale malcontento per le pesantissime condizioni di lavoro e di vita di milioni di proletari.
 </p>
<p>
  Negli stessi giorni, infatti, sono scesi in lotta anche centinaia di lavoratori di una grande impresa di costruzioni di proprietà del miliardario Talaat Moustafa, in società con la famiglia saudita dei Bin Laden.
 </p>
 Hanno protestato contro il licenziamento dei lavoratori a tempo indeterminato (soprattutto quelli che hanno subito incidenti sul lavoro o si sono ammalati) per assumere lavoratori con contratti precari, e chiedendo il pagamento di arretrati, un aumento salariale per il carovita, misure di sicurezza e dispositivi di protezione sui cantieri, una maggiore copertura sanitaria.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  In questo caso è significativo che le guardie aziendali, che una settimana prima erano intervenute a reprimere una protesta degli impiegati, qualche giorno dopo hanno a loro volta rifiutato di entrare in servizio, lamentando il fatto di essere pagati LE 3000 (60 euro) al mese per 14 ore di lavoro al giorno, e hanno ottenuto un aumento.
 </p>
<p>
  Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa, divenuto un colosso con le commesse per la nuova capitale, sta ora partecipando in società con il gruppo Adq degli Emirati a un progetto da 35 miliardi di dollari per la costruzione di una città turistica sul litorale mediterraneo, su terreni privatizzati dai militari.
 </p>
<p>
  Questi episodi di lotte operaie sono indicativi di una temperatura sociale che sta salendo in Egitto come in altri paesi del Medio Oriente e che potrebbe portare a nuove esplosioni se la crisi economica si aggraverà, in collegamento anche con la rabbia provocata dalla guerra genocidaria di Israele contro la popolazione di Gaza.
  <br/>
  Non a caso il Fmi offre ad al-Sisi miliardi in cambio del lavoro sporco di collaborazione con Israele; mentre da parte loro Meloni e von del Leyen promettono 7,4 miliardi di euro all’Egitto perché faccia il lavoro altrettanto sporco di trattenere gli emigranti verso l’Europa, oltre che per altri lucrosi affari.
 </p>
<p>
  Ci permettiamo di ripeterlo: gli unici veri amici dei palestinesi aggrediti e oppressi da Israele a Gaza e in Cisgiordania sono i lavoratori e gli sfruttati della regione e del mondo, non i governi capitalisti arabi che sfruttano e reprimono i propri lavoratori e sono pronti a fare affari collaborando con le metropoli imperialiste nella repressione di palestinesi e migranti.

   MIGLIAIA DI LAVORATORI SCIOPERANO PER L’AUMENTO DEI SALARI NELLA FABBRICA DI GHAZL AL-MAHALLA
  </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
  – di Beesan Kassab, 25 febbraio 2024
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori di Ghazl al-Mahalla sono in sciopero per ottenere salari più alti e bonus più equi.
 </p>
<p>
  Circa 7.000 lavoratori si sono riuniti sabato mattina nella piazza centrale del complesso industriale di Ghazl al-Mahalla per uno sciopero che dura già da tre giorni.
 </p>
<p>
  Chiedono che il loro pasto giornaliero venga aumentato a 30 LE [=0,57 euro], alzando un coro in cui si dice che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
 </p>
<p>
  Chiedono anche l’applicazione di salari più alti, facendo riferimento a un recente aumento salariale per il settore pubblico basato su istruzioni del presidente Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in mezzo a un’ondata inflazionistica che ha fatto salire il costo della vita a livello nazionale. In altri slogan, i lavoratori hanno chiesto: “Dov’è la decisione di Sisi?”.
 </p>
<p>
  La mega-fabbrica di proprietà pubblica impiega decine di migliaia di persone nei settori della filatura, del tessile e del cotone medicale, oltre a una centrale elettrica su un’enorme area di terreno a Mahalla al-Kubra, nel governatorato di Gharbiya.
 </p>
<p>
  Fino a domenica, le trattative dei lavoratori con la società madre sono fallite, ha dichiarato il Centro per i sindacati e i servizi ai lavoratori in un comunicato diffuso sabato sera. All’incontro hanno partecipato un rappresentante della presidenza, dell’Ufficio del Lavoro, del Ministero del Commercio e dell’Industria e il presidente del Sindacato Generale della Filatura e Tessitura.
 </p>
<p>
  Diversi uomini che lavorano nell’azienda sono stati trattenuti sabato dall’Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza dopo essere stati convocati per essere interrogati dall’organismo di sicurezza insieme ad alcune lavoratrici, ha dichiarato la CTUWS, senza specificare il numero dei detenuti.
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori hanno lanciato lo sciopero giovedì [22 febbraio], hanno dichiarato a Mada Masr, iniziando nelle fabbriche di abbigliamento a prevalenza femminile, che storicamente sono state in prima linea in diversi scioperi famosi dell’azienda.
 </p>
<p>
  Hanan*, supervisore di una fabbrica di abbigliamento, ha raccontato a Mada Masr che gli operai del suo edificio hanno iniziato a scandire slogan, interrompendo infine il lavoro mentre i canti si diffondevano da una fabbrica all’altra.
 </p>
<p>
  Contemporaneamente, il personale di sicurezza ha sigillato le uscite per evitare che le donne si riversassero nella piazza centrale del complesso, nota come piazza Talaat Harb. Questa misura di sicurezza è stata applicata anche alla centrale elettrica, secondo Abdullah* che lavora lì.
 </p>
<p>
  Il personale di sicurezza ha sbloccato i cancelli della fabbrica intorno alle 15.00 di giovedì, mezz’ora prima della fine del turno mattutino, per assicurarsi che i lavoratori uscissero dai locali e non si riunissero all’interno, ha detto Hanan.
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori dell’azienda hanno descritto i bassi salari come causa di insoddisfazione.
 </p>
<p>
  Il costo della vita è aumentato in tutto il Paese, con un’inflazione che supererà il 30% nel 2024. Un recente “pacchetto presidenziale”, che sarà varato a partire da marzo, prevede un aumento del salario minimo per il settore pubblico da 4.000 a 6.000 LE al mese, con incrementi che vanno da 1.000 a 1.200 LE per le diverse categorie lavorative.
 </p>
<p>
  Sebbene sia di proprietà dello Stato, la Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, che possiede Ghazl al-Mahalla, non rientra nell’ambito del pacchetto presidenziale, ha dichiarato a Mada Masr una fonte del Ministero delle Finanze.
 </p>
<p>
  I salari dell’azienda sono invece guidati dalle decisioni del Consiglio nazionale per i salari, che lo scorso ottobre ha innalzato il salario minimo del settore privato a 3.500 LE.
 </p>
<p>
  Ma l’aumento di ottobre non è servito a contrastare la riduzione del potere d’acquisto causata dall’inflazione. Dopo più di 25 anni di servizio, Abdel Aziz* ha dichiarato a Mada Masr che il suo guadagno totale non supera i 4.000 LE al mese. La cifra equivale a circa 130 dollari al tasso di cambio ufficiale, o a circa 80 dollari al tasso del mercato parallelo al momento in cui scriviamo.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdullah ha dichiarato che il suo stipendio è di 4.200 LEE dopo 33 anni di lavoro con l’azienda. Hanan, che si sta avvicinando alla pensione, riceve uno stipendio di circa 6.200 LE.
 </p>
<p>
  Diverse fonti di lavoro dell’azienda hanno raccontato che giorni prima dello sciopero, il governatore di Gharbiya aveva effettuato una serie di visite per ispezionare un convoglio che fornisce beni sovvenzionati ai lavoratori dell’azienda.
 </p>
<p>
  Abdel Aziz ha aggiunto che durante la visita di mercoledì, il governatore ha ispezionato un convoglio medico che rifornisce i lavoratori e “un lavoratore ha detto al governatore che il suo stipendio non supera i 3500 LE”.
 </p>
<p>
  Secondo una dichiarazione della CTUWS pubblicata sabato, i lavoratori chiedono ora che il salario minimo sia portato a 6.000 LE, con aumenti salariali in base all’anzianità di servizio e una riduzione degli stanziamenti fiscali.
 </p>
<p>
  Chiedono inoltre che la loro indennità giornaliera per i pasti sia aumentata a 30 LE, per un totale di 900 LE al mese invece degli attuali 210 LE al mese, con un canto che circolava durante lo sciopero in cui si affermava che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
 </p>
<p>
  La dichiarazione del CTUWS di sabato [24 febbraio] ha sottolineato che i membri del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda, affiliato alla Federazione sindacale egiziana allineata allo Stato, hanno cercato di dissuadere i lavoratori dallo sciopero e di intimidirli, ma sono stati espulsi dalla piazza.
 </p>
<p>
  Una figura di spicco del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda ha dichiarato giovedì a Mada Masr, a condizione di anonimato, che il comitato “preferisce la negoziazione allo sciopero, ma sostiene le richieste dei lavoratori”.
 </p>
<p>
  Ghazl al-Mahalla ha agito da catalizzatore alla fine del 2006 per una rinascita dell’azione sindacale a livello nazionale, quando uno sciopero di decine di migliaia di lavoratori della fabbrica si è riverberato in un movimento di scioperi simili in altre fabbriche del Paese.
 </p>
<p>
  *Su loro richiesta, Mada Masr ha utilizzato pseudonimi per tutte le fonti.

  Ginevra – 6 marzo 2024
 </p>
<p>
  In uno sviluppo preoccupante, la Sicurezza Nazionale di Gharbia, in Egitto, avrebbe trattenuto almeno cinque dipendenti della rinomata azienda tessile Ghazl El-Mahalla, nonostante la decisione dei lavoratori di disperdere il loro sciopero del 29 febbraio 2024.
  <br/>
  I dipendenti hanno iniziato lo sciopero per chiedere l’applicazione del salario minimo.
 </p>
<p>
  Tra i detenuti ci sono Wael Abu Zuwayed e Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, attualmente trattenuti presso la sede della Sicurezza Nazionale a Tanta. Essi si aggiungono ad altri tre lavoratori, Sabah Ali al-Qattan, Muhammad al-Attar e Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, anch’essi detenuti.
 </p>
<p>
  Wael Abu Zuwayed è stato portato davanti alla Procura della Sicurezza di Stato del Cairo, dove è stato deciso di trattenerlo in custodia cautelare per 15 giorni. È accusato di aver aderito a un gruppo formato in violazione della legge e di aver diffuso false informazioni.
 </p>
<p>
  Con una mossa controversa, il 4 marzo la direzione di Ghazl El Mahalla ha emesso avvisi di licenziamento per i lavoratori detenuti, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed e Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. L’azienda sostiene che la loro assenza dal lavoro è durata dieci giorni, ignorando opportunamente che è avvenuta in seguito alla loro detenzione da parte della Sicurezza Nazionale.
 </p>
<p>
  Il Comitato per la giustizia (CFJ) ha condannato le detenzioni, affermando che lo sciopero è una reazione “spontanea” alle difficoltà economiche dell’Egitto e alla confusione della politica finanziaria. Il CFJ sottolinea la necessità di un dialogo costruttivo e di soluzioni realistiche per affrontare le legittime richieste dei lavoratori, invece di ricorrere alla repressione e all’intimidazione. […]

  Oltre a subire le pressioni delle masse per la vile risposta del regime egiziano agli spietati attacchi dello Stato israeliano a Gaza, il presidente “uomo forte” Sisi deve affrontare la crescente rabbia dei lavoratori. L’aumento vertiginoso dei prezzi dei generi alimentari ha colpito duramente i lavoratori egiziani a basso salario, ma ci sono segnali di una ripresa della lotta.
 </p>
<p>
  Circa 14.000 lavoratori tessili della più grande fabbrica egiziana, la Misr Spin-ning and Weaving Company, a Mahalla al-Kubra, nella regione del Delta del Nilo, hanno iniziato una settimana di sciopero il 22 febbraio. I lavoratori di una delle maggiori filiali della società immobiliare Talaat Moustafa Group, la Alexan-dria Construction, al Cairo, hanno protestato il 28 febbraio.
 </p>
<p>
  Sono state le lavoratrici della fabbrica di abbigliamento Mahalla a iniziare a scandire slogan che si sono rapidamente diffusi da un edificio all’altro. Il personale di sicurezza ha bloccato le uscite per impedire che questi lavoratori, così come quelli della centrale elettrica in loco, si riunissero nella piazza centrale. Tuttavia, il terzo giorno, 7.000 scioperanti si sono radunati lì. Decine di persone sono state arrestate. Come di consueto, il comitato sindacale ufficiale gestito dallo Stato ha denunciato lo sciopero, ma i lavoratori li hanno cacciati dalla manifestazione.
 </p>
<p>
  Questo evento riecheggia lo storico sciopero del 2006, quando le donne di Mahalla iniziarono lo sciopero che fu un passo fondamentale verso la rivolta del 2011 che mise fine ai 31 anni di governo del presidente Hosni Mubarak. Nel 2008, la città ha assistito a una rivolta che si sarebbe ripetuta su scala nazionale tre anni dopo.
 </p>
<p>
  […] Lo sciopero è terminato dopo una settimana, in seguito all’intervento del Ministro del settore pubblico. La direzione ha accettato di pagare un minimo di 6.000 LE al mese e la maggior parte dei lavoratori arrestati è stata rilasciata. Un’offerta precedente, che includeva il pagamento degli straordinari, la partecipazione agli utili e l’assicurazione sanitaria, non è stata accettata.
 </p>
<p>
  Protesta dei lavoratori edili
 </p>
<p>
  Centinaia di lavoratori della Talaat Moustafa hanno protestato davanti alla sede dell’azienda. L’azienda ha licenziato lavoratori con contratti a tempo indeterminato e li ha sostituiti con lavoratori temporanei a condizioni peggiori. I lavoratori hanno chiesto pagamenti arretrati, un bonus per il costo della vita, una migliore assicurazione sanitaria e dispositivi di sicurezza nei cantieri.
 </p>
<p>
  Le condizioni dei cantieri sono pessime, non sono disponibili dispositivi di sicurezza e la copertura sanitaria è insufficiente. Molti lavoratori licenziati sono stati feriti sul lavoro o soffrono di malattie croniche.
 </p>
<p>
  I lavoratori hanno riferito ai giornalisti che i criteri per i bonus e gli aumenti sono oscuri, ma vengono costantemente erogati a persone imparentate o collegate ai dirigenti. I dirigenti e i loro assistenti ricevono benefici sontuosi, mentre le retribuzioni dei lavoratori rimangono basse.
 </p>
<p>
  Insolitamente, la polizia non ha tentato di bloccare la protesta, anche se in passato ha fermato proteste più piccole. Tuttavia, il 4 marzo una protesta dei lavoratori degli uffici è stata impedita quando le forze di sicurezza hanno bloccato i cancelli.
 </p>
<p>
  Ma poi centinaia di guardie di sicurezza dell’azienda si sono rifiutate di iniziare il loro turno! Hanno chiesto salari più alti, migliori benefit, orari di lavoro e ferie. “I nostri stipendi sono molto bassi, pari a 3.000 LE. Lavoriamo per oltre 14 ore al giorno, a differenza del resto dei dipendenti. Riceviamo il bonus trimestrale a una percentuale inferiore rispetto a loro”, ha spiegato una guardia.
 </p>
<p>
  Nel giro di 30 minuti, un alto dirigente li ha incontrati, promettendo di pagare un aumento entro due mesi, dopodiché la protesta è terminata.
 </p>
<p>
  Il regime di Mubarak rimane
 </p>
<p>
  Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa ha avuto enormi contratti per la costruzione della nuova capitale che il presidente Sisi ha supervisionato. Nell’ultimo anno ha triplicato le sue attività nel settore immobiliare e dell’ospitalità, nonostante la crisi economica dell’Egitto. Negli ultimi mesi il prezzo delle sue azioni è salito, facendo guadagnare milioni di dollari al suo multimilionario azionista principale, Talaat Moustafa. Uno degli uomini più ricchi dell’Africa, era vicino al figlio di Hosni Mubarak, Gamal, odiato dai lavoratori per aver spinto una vasta privatizzazione quando il padre era presidente.
 </p>
<p>
  Nel 2008, Talaat Moustafa è stato riconosciuto colpevole di aver pagato 2 milioni di dollari a un ex poliziotto per uccidere la cantante libanese Suzanne Tamim. Gli altri principali azionisti del Gruppo Talaat Moustafa sono la famiglia Bin Laden dell’Arabia Saudita.
 </p>
<p>
  A febbraio, la società ha concluso un accordo di partnership con la società di investimenti degli Emirati Arabi Uniti ADQ per la costruzione di una nuova e vasta città turistica a Ras el-Hikma, sulla costa mediterranea, a ovest di Alessandria. L’operazione da 35 miliardi di dollari, compresa la vendita di terreni da parte dell’esercito, aiuterà notevolmente il governo di Sisi a pagare i 42 miliardi di dollari di debiti e gli interessi che dovrà pagare quest’anno. Molti sono gli interrogativi sollevati, tra cui la fattibilità del progetto, il suo costo ambientale, il vero valore del terreno, come si sia arrivati alla proprietà dell’esercito, quale sia l’opinione dei residenti locali (che non sono stati consultati) e quali controlli ci saranno sui futuri profitti in una “zona economica libera”.
 </p>
<p>
  Il disperato bisogno di valuta estera del governo Sisi lo ha costretto a vendere beni di proprietà dello Stato. Ras el-Hikma si aggiunge alla lista crescente di aziende e terreni egiziani ora sotto la proprietà e il controllo del Golfo.
 </p>
<p>
  Le gravi disuguaglianze, la corruzione e la brutale repressione dell’opposizione del regime dell’ex presidente Hosni Mubarak sono continuate, e persino aumentate, sotto Sisi. I recenti scioperi e le proteste dei lavoratori potrebbero segnare l’inizio di una nuova ondata di azioni della classe operaia, come quella sviluppatasi negli ultimi anni di Mubarak.
 </p>
<p>
  Il risveglio della classe operaia egiziana potrebbe essere un potente fattore per porre fine alla crisi di Gaza, aprire il valico di Rafah agli aiuti umanitari e incoraggiare i lavoratori e i poveri di tutto il Medio Oriente e del Nord Africa a spodestare i loro governanti mega-ricchi in tutta la regione.
 </p>
<p>
  Per porre fine alla povertà capitalista, alla guerra e alla distruzione dell’ambiente è necessario costruire sindacati indipendenti e partiti dei lavoratori con programmi socialisti, democratici e internazionalisti.

<span>
   NEWROZ PİROZ BE!
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Newroz is the symbol of the
revolt of the exploited and oppressed peoples against the oppressors
and exploiters in the thousands of years of class societies in our
geography. Today, it has become the name of the rebellion and
resistance of all oppressed peoples, especially the Kurdish people,
against the persecution of cruelty, the rebellion of the blacksmith
Kawa against the cruel and massacring Dehaks, and the burning of the
fires of rebellion in all four corners.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   We are welcoming Newroz in a
period in which the attacks and massacres of the cruel Dehaks are
increasing worldwide and in our geography. We are in a process where
the conditions for a new imperialist sharing war are maturing and
preparations are being made for it. The increasing rivalry of the
imperialist bourgeoisie is triggering conflicts and occupations at
the regional level. There are not only rivalries and "trade
wars" between the imperialist blocs. The possibility of direct
military confrontation is also increasing. As Russia's war of
occupation of Ukraine evolves into a "protracted war"  war
between the imperialist camps, some spokespersons of the bourgeoisie
make statements that "we must be ready for war".
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The increasing rivalry between
imperialist monopolies is increasing the aggression of reactionary
forces in our geography. They raise their heads to take advantage of
the crisis
   <span>
</span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<span>
  for their own interests, to expand their areas of
domination and to hold positions. After the Azerbaijani reactionary
occupation of Artsakh-Nagorno-Karabakh, the attacks launched by
Israeli Zionism, citing the October 7 Flood of the Palestinian
national resistance, turned into genocide. The oppressed Palestinian
people were confronted with a new Nakba (catastrophe).
  <span>
</span>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The Turkish state, one of the
most reactionary forces in our geography, continues its aggression
against the Kurdish nation with daily terrorist attacks on the
territory of the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria-Rojava
and invasion attacks against Iraqi Kurdistan. It is preparing for a
comprehensive invasion attack to liquidate the gains of the Rojava
Revolution and to eliminate the heavy military losses it suffered in
Iraqi Kurdistan. While liquidating the gains of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement, the Turkish state is aiming for occupation and then
annexation in the region. It wants to realize its centuries-old
"Misak-ı Milli" goal with the approval of the imperialists
and with its own collaborator reactionary lines in the region.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   For this purpose, after
negotiations with the reactionary forces of the region, a bargain was
struck at the door of US imperialism. The fascist Turkish Republic's
traditional policy of "taking advantage of the contradictions
between the imperialist camps" is once again in effect. Once
again, preparations are being made to attack the oppressed peoples of
our geography, especially the Kurdish people. For this, the isolation
policy is being implemented on revolutionary and patriotic prisoners,
especially Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdish National
Freedom Movement. On the other hand, pressure and arrest attacks
against revolutionaries continue.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   The reason for this aggression
of the Turkish fascism is not independent of the situation it is in.
The century-old regime of oppression and exploitation is in a picture
of complete bankruptcy, especially in the economy. As we have
witnessed in the Earthquakes of February 6, while tens of thousands
of people are waiting for help under the debris, they were faced with
a reality of an enemy of the people who did nothing and prevented
those who go to help. The government, which responded to the people's
call for help from the mouth of R.T. Erdogan himself with the curses
"You're immoral, you're despicable, you're dishonorable";
At the current stage, he is once again asking for votes from the
people. The general elections did not solve the crisis of the ruling
classes and even failed to postpone it. At the current stage, they
are once again struggling for rent sharing, this time on the occasion
of local elections.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   While the ruling classes
continue to fight for rent and cliques within themselves, the poverty
of workers and laborers is increasing. Dozens of workers are murdered
every other day in workplace murders. There is an increase in
massacres and hate crimes against women and other gender identities.
Massacres of nature and the environment for the sake of capitalist
rent and plunder continue at full speed. The policy of annihilation,
denial, assimilation and oppression against oppressed nationalities
and beliefs, especially the Kurdish nation, continues. The policies
implemented by fascism to maintain its power have created a situation
of social insanity in which torturous massacres of stray animals are
committed.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Turkish state fascism, facing
this picture it has created with its government and opposition, does
what it knows best, fueling racism and chauvinism, under the name of
"social values", it increases its fascist oppression
against "those who are not like itself" and in reality
against all segments that do not obey it. Sunni Islam, the dominant
belief of Turkish fascism, is used as a means of oppressing different
beliefs and to prevent the working and laboring people from rebelling
against the conditions of hunger and poverty they are forced into.
While the policy of "Prayers for Palestine, Ships for Israel"
is continued with determination, fascist aggression against those who
do not bow their heads continues.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   Today's cruel Dehaks are at
work. They continue their robbery, extortion and massacres against
the people of the region, especially the people of our country, for
their own wealth and riches. They are preparing new invasions and
attacks for the survival of their regimes built on corruption and
theft. However, there are and will always be blacksmith Kawas against
the cruel Dehaks.
  </span>
</p>
<p align="justify" lang="en-GB" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span>
   It is time to be the
blacksmith Kawa against the cruel Dehaks. Now is the time to resist
and struggle. Now is the time to stand up against the oppressors.

  L’esperienza storica della Comune di Parigi ha provato appieno che è di estrema importanza per la rivoluzione proletaria e la dittatura del proletariato possedere forze armate rivoluzionarie.

  Parlando dell’esperienza della Comune di Parigi, Lenin cita un’importante tesi di Engels, ossia che in Francia, dopo ogni rivoluzione, gli operai erano armati; il disarmo degli operai era quindi il primo comandamento per i borghesi che si trovavano al governo dello Stato. Lenin ritiene che in questa conclusione di Engels, “l’essenza del problema, come del resto l’essenza della questione dello Stato (la classe oppressa dispone di armi?), è afferrata in modo ammirevole”.
  <br/>
  La Comune di Parigi nacque durante l’accanita lotta tra la rivoluzione armata e la controrivoluzione armata. I 72 giorni di vita della Comune di Parigi furono 72 giorni di insurrezione armata, di lotta armata e di autodifesa armata. Ciò che provocò un timor panico tra i reazionari borghesi fu proprio il
  <span>
<a name="more">
</a>
</span>
  fatto che il proletariato di Parigi aveva impugnato il fucile. L’errore fatale della Comune di Parigi risiedette precisamente nel fatto che essa si dimostrò troppo clemente verso la controrivoluzione e non marciò immediatamente su Versailles, ciò che permise a Thiers di riprendere fiato e di radunare le sue truppe reazionarie per gettarsi furiosamente su Parigi rivoluzionaria. Come disse Engels: “Sarebbe la Comune di Parigi durata un solo giorno se non si fosse servita di questa autorità del popolo armato contro i borghesi? Non si può al contrario rimproverarle di non essersene servita abbastanza?”
  <br/>
<br/>
  Il compagno Mao Tse-tung ha ricapitolato in modo conciso l’importante significato della lotta armata e dell’esercito popolare e ha formulato la famosa tesi secondo la quale “il potere politico nasce dalla canna del fucile”
  <br/>
<br/>
  Egli ha sottolineato: “Secondo la teoria marxista dello Stato, l’esercito è la principale componente del potere statale. Chiunque voglia impadronirsi del potere statale e conservarlo, deve possedere un forte esercito”.
  <br/>
<br/>
  La rivoluzione violenta è un principio universale della rivoluzione proletaria. I partiti marxisti-leninisti devono seguire con fermezza questo principio universale e applicarlo alla pratica concreta dei loro paesi. L’esperienza storica dimostra che là dove il proletariato e i popoli oppressi hanno preso il potere e conquistato la vittoria, essi l’hanno fatto con la forza del fucile, sotto la direzione dei partiti proletari, in conformità delle condizioni specifiche dei propri paesi, costituendo gradualmente forze armate popolari e conducendo la guerra popolare sulla base dell’ampia mobilitazione delle masse nella lotta e ingaggiando ripetute lotte contro gli imperialisti e i reazionari. Ciò vale per la rivoluzione russa, per la rivoluzione cinese e per la rivoluzione dell’Albania, del Vietnam, della Corea e di altri paesi, senza alcuna eccezione.
  <br/>
  Al contrario, quando i partiti proletari non cercano di creare forze armate rivoluzionarie o vi rinunciano, essi causano rovesci alla rivoluzione; esistono serie lezioni a questo proposito. Avendo rinunciato a impugnare il fucile, alcuni partiti sono stati presi alla sprovvista di fronte a un attacco di sorpresa dell’imperialismo e dei suoi lacchè e alla loro repressione controrivoluzionaria e di conseguenza milioni di rivoluzionari sono stati massacrati; in altri casi, poiché volevano ottenere posti di alti funzionari nei governi borghesi o sono caduti nella trappola tesa dai reazionari, alcuni partiti hanno consegnato loro le forze armate popolari, rovinando i frutti della rivoluzione, quando il popolo rivoluzionario aveva già impugnato le armi e le forze armate popolari si erano già sviluppate notevolmente.
  <br/>
  In questi cento anni, molti partiti comunisti hanno partecipato alle elezioni e sono entrati nel parlamento, ma nessuno di essi ha potuto instaurare la dittatura del proletariato con tale mezzo. Anche se un partito comunista ottiene la maggioranza nel parlamento o entra nel governo, ciò non significa che il carattere borghese del potere politico sia cambiato e ancora meno che la vecchia macchina statale sia demolita. La classe dominante reazionaria potrà proclamare non valide le elezioni, sciogliere il parlamento o addirittura ricorrere alla violenza per estromettere i comunisti. Se un partito proletario, invece di svolgere il lavoro tra le masse e di impegnarsi nella lotta armata, sostiene con zelo le elezioni
  <br/>
  parlamentari, esso non farà altro che addormentare le masse e corrompere se stesso. La borghesia compra i partiti comunisti attraverso le elezioni parlamentari e li trasforma in partiti revisionisti, in partiti borghesi. La storia non ci fornisce forse numerosi esempi di questo genere?
  <br/>
  Il proletariato deve conquistare il potere politico con il fucile e deve anche difenderlo con il fucile. Un esercito popolare sotto la direzione di un partito marxista-leninista è il solido pilastro della dittatura del proletariato e il fattore principale tra i vari fattori per prevenire la restaurazione del capitalismo. Con un esercito popolare armato dell’ideologia marxista-leninista, si può affrontare qualsiasi situazione, per quanto complessa possa essere, nella lotta di classe sia all’interno che fuori del paese e difendere il potere del proletariato...

    Il
28 marzo a Budapest, si celebrerà la seconda udienza che vede
imputata Ilaria Salis
   </b>
   in un processo la cui valenza è unicamente
politica. La procura dello Stato ungherese vuole mandare un messaggio
a tutti i movimenti antinazisti e di sinistra europei: non venite a
manifestare da noi, siamo un paese dove manifestazioni antinaziste
non sono ben accette, non siamo un paese che accoglie il dissenso
contro i neonazisti quindi andate da un'altra parte a manifestare, se
venite qui subirete la sorte di Ilaria Salis e degli altri suoi
compagni che in questo momento si trovano incarcerati.

<span style="">
    Se
ne è discusso a Torino, durante un interessante incontro organizzato presso la Casa del Popolo Estella, per ricordare quanto sta accadendo, ne ha parlato il padre di Ilaria,
    <b>
     Roberto Salis
    </b>
    , il quale ha ripercorso il dramma giudiziario
che sta vivendo la figlia. Le condizioni disumane di detenzione sia a
livello igienico che a livello di regime carcerario poiché per ben
35 giorni ad Ilaria non è stato concesso il diritto di parlare con
alcuno; la procedura processuale che evidenzia palesi violazione dei
diritti essenziali dell’imputato - ricordiamo che a tutt’oggi ad
Ilaria non è stata data la possibilità di prendere visione delle
prove raccolte a suo carico dalla procura ungherese; tutto evidenzia
la compromissione del diritto di difesa in un racconto che sembra
arrivare da un luogo molto lontano dallo stato di diritto che
dovrebbe caratterizzare gli Stati membri dell'unione europea.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span style="">
    Ed
infatti,
    <b>
     Massimo Congiu
    </b>
    , giornalista, studioso di geopolitica
dell’Europa centro-orientale, ospite del predetto incontro, ha
sottolineato come nella pratica del sistema di potere di Victor Orban
l’idea di giustizia è quella di una giustizia che punisce,
avvilisce, mortifica senza alcun rispetto per la dignità umana, per
la dignità della persona, come effettivamente abbiamo purtroppo
visto con Ilaria. Il sistema di potere di Orban è un sistema basato
sulla paura, fortemente antidemocratico che produce ed afferma una
serie di falsità alcune particolarmente atroci ripetute a mò di
martellamento che determina effetti deleteri sull’opinione
pubblica, ed il prevalere di questa paura genera una giustizia vista
e presentata come qualcosa di cui si debba temere. La commissione
europea ha sanzionato più volte l’Ungheria per violazione dei
diritti umani bloccando anche i fondi destinati a Budapest per
l’ammontare di ben 20 miliardi. Ma vi sono altri aspetti di cui il
governo ungherese si è distinto negativamente e, sempre citando
l’intervento di Congiu, si parla per esempio del controllo che
esercita sulla stampa, del suo impegno a silenziare le voci
dissenzienti, dell’impegno a controllare in modo capillare le varie
manifestazioni della vita pubblica del paese fino alla vita
accademica dell'università. Si pone, quindi, in maniera drammatica
una questione di Stato di diritto in questo paese che Orban
attraverso una sua retorica e propaganda animata da sentimenti
patriottici, ultranazionalisti sta modellando proprio in tal senso
ovvero in termini antidemocratici e la povera Ilaria si trova
incastrata in questo meccanismo.

    Il
dibattito è continuato con l’intervento di
    <b>
     Francesca Trasatti
    </b>
    ,
avvocata, osservatrice per il Centro di Ricerca ed Elaborazione per
la Democrazia nel processo Salis, la quale ha subito evidenziato come
la vicenda di Ilaria Salis rappresenti un vero e proprio buco nero
della democrazia politica e del giusto processo. Un trattamento
disumano e degradante che configura una tortura considerato che per
le normative internazionali 15 giorni di isolamento prolungato
costituiscono a tutti gli effetti tortura ed Ilaria ha subìto un
isolamento per ben 35 giorni, ma soprattutto non sta scontando alcuna
condanna bensì solo carcerazione preventiva. Anche la stessa
procedura processuale non garantisce in alcun modo il diritto di
difesa di Ilaria né l’imparzialità di un giudice che ha già
emesso decisione di condanna nei confronti di un coimputato tedesco
nel medesimo processo di Ilaria.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;">
<span style="">
    L’Ungheria
di Orban è un’ombra nera antidemocratica che macchia l’Europa,
che in Italia trova sponda nell’amica Presidente la quale si è
fintamente appellata all’indipendenza della magistratura,
all’autonomia dei giudici, ben sapendo che l’Ungheria ha molto da
imparare in tema di  separazione dei poteri e di rispetto dei diritti
umani essenziali.

     Nella
lunga storia di lotta del nostro movimento democratico popolare, il
23 marzo ha un valore rivoluzionario particolare nel cuore di tutti
quanti si battono per una società giusta e allo stesso tempo
disprezzano risolutamente l’imperialismo. Il 23 marzo i compagni
Bhagat Singh, Sukdev e Rajguru sono stati impiccati dal potere
coloniale britannico per schiacciare il movimento di liberazione
anti-coloniale di allora. La vittoria della rivoluzione bolscevica
aveva influenzato questi tre rivoluzionari indiani che formarono
dell'HSRA (Associazione Rivoluzionaria Socialista dell'Hindustan). Il
compagno Baghat Singh ebbe un ruolo fondamentale nella formazione
dell'HSRA, e affermò chiaramente che quale che sia il colore le
classi dominanti, che siano di pelle bianca, nera o altro, si deve
continuare la lotta contro tutti gli sfruttatori.

     Dopo
l'indipendenza formale nel 1947, l'India è divenuto un paese
semi-coloniale e le classi dominanti indiane, la grande borghesia
compradora e i proprietari terrieri hanno continuato a servire senza
esitazione i loro padroni imperialisti. Tutte le politiche economiche
delle classi dominanti indiane dopo il 1947 sono state concepite al
servizio degli interessi dell’imperialismo e delle élite
nazionali. Le classi borghese compradora  e dei latifondisti,
proprietari della gran parte dei mezzi di produzione del paese, hanno
attuato una politica industriale di sviluppo distorta a vantaggio
proprio e dei loro padroni imperialisti. Scopo sulla politica
industriale era quella soddisfare i bisogni dell’1% della
popolazione delle élites dell’India. Con la penetrazione del
capitale finanziario (sotto forma sia di crediti che di investimenti)
ci sono stati espropri su vasta scala, deportazioni senza precedenti
di popolazioni oppresse. Le masse lavoratrici indiane continuarono a
soffrire uno sfruttamento sfrenato, anche più intenso di prima. Dopo
gli anni ’90, sotto i dettami delle forze imperialiste, le classi
dominanti indiane hanno attuato politiche di liberalizzazione,
globalizzazione e privatizzazione. Misure che hanno dato mano libera
al capitale imperialista straniero di rapinare e saccheggiare le
risorse dell’India e accumularne sempre più profitti. Tutti i
principali partiti politici parlamentari, indipendentemente dal
colore delle loro bandiere, hanno immancabilmente imposto politiche
di globalizzazione, privatizzazione e liberalizzazione. Così hanno
spezzato la spina dorsale dell’economia indiana e causato
l’indescrivibile  miseria delle masse lavoratrici.

     Dopo
la salita al potere di Narendra Modi nel 2014 sotto, il BJP ha fatto
dell’India un campo aperto alla rapina e saccheggio del capitale
straniero grazie a programmi pilota quali “Make in India”,
“Digital India”, “One Nation-One Tax”, “Start-UP India” e
molti altri ancora. Il BJP ha adottato programmi e politiche
filo-imperialiste contro agli interessi delle larghe masse del paese.
Da un lato consegna alle multinazionali straniere le risorse del
paese, dall’altro fomenta i conflitti religiosi, con la sua agenda
di Hindu Rashtra. Il compagno  Bhagat Singh era risolutamente
contrario a ogni politica filo-imperialista o all’ideologia
fondamentalista da cui hanno avuto origine RSS e BJP. Bhagat Singh
era totalmente contrario all'Hindu-Rashtra s all'idea di una nazione
basata sulla religione o razza. Sosteneva le idee del pensiero
scientifico, laiche e socialiste. Oggi invece le forze brahmaniche
Hindutva distorcono le idee del compagno Bhagat Singh per sostenere
il loro progetto di Hindu Rashtra.

     La
crescita economica dell’India significa usurpazione delle terre
degli oppressi. Per uscire dalla sua crisi generale, l'imperialismo
va a caccia delle risorse naturali a basso costo disponibili nei
paesi del terzo mondo. L’India ha abbondanti riserve di risorse
naturali, che si trovano principalmente nelle regioni delle
popolazioni tribali dell’India centrale e orientale. Per
saccheggiare queste risorse, l’imperialismo sostiene ogni attacco
fascista contro le popolazioni indigene dell’India da parte dello
Stato ad esso fedele. Per schiacciare il movimento rivoluzionario
maoista in India, le classi dominanti indiane, in collaborazione con
gli imperialisti, portarono avanti diversi programmi di fascisti
anti-sovversione, come Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operazione Green Hunt,
Operazione Operazione Samadhan, e ora ha lanciato la Operazione
Kagaar. Tutti questi genocidi fascisti di indigeni sono finanziati,
diretti e aspirati dalla finanza mondiale e dal capitale burocratico
compradore. Nel suo stadio di crisi avanzata, l’imperialismo
diventa feroce e in India ha dato origine a un sistema politico
fascista. Nell’India centrale è in corso un i ingente
dispiegamento di forze militari per accelerare il saccheggio delle
risorse naturali dei territori Adivasi. La resistenza popolare contro
il processo si privatizzazione e militarizzazione di villaggi, terre
e foreste è repressa brutalmente dallo stato indiano sotto il
governo del BJP. Ogni giorno i giornali del Chhattisgarh riportano
notizie terrificanti di uccisioni di Adivasi da parte delle forze di
polizia. Non è un fatto nuovo né cesserà fino a quando questo
agonizzante sistema di saccheggio e saccheggio non sarà sradicato
dall’India. La stessa origine del capitalismo si fondò sul
massacro delle popolazioni indigene di Africa e in America Latina.
Nel 21° secolo L’imperialismo ha sviluppato apparati e armi
mortali ancora più brutali per massacrare le masse in lotta. Oggi,
il popolo del'Indiaa (soprattutto dell’India centrale e orientale)
guidato del PCI (maoista) sta combattendo contro queste armi e piani
del nemico.

<strong>
   Hyderabad District, March 21, 2024:
  </strong>
  The Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has called upon all democratic forces and others including peasantry, Dalits, women’s organizations, and others to celebrate March 23 as an anti-imperialism day with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm.
 </p>
<p>
  It also appealed to the masses to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru; and to expose the alleged treacherous design of the Hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades who laid down their lives fighting the imperialist forces.
 </p>
<p>
  A statement issued today in the name of Comrade Pratap, spokesperson for the Central Regional Bureau of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), has emphasized the need to combat imperialism and Brahmanical Hindutva fascism, advocating for a New Democratic India.
 </p>
<p>
  “March 23 holds historical significance as it was the day Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were martyred by British colonial powers,” Comrade Pratap said, adding that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Pratap criticized the post-independence economic policies, accusing ruling classes of serving imperialism and exacerbating exploitation. Pointing at the BJP government led by Narendra Modi, Comrade Pratap accused it of facilitating foreign capital exploitation through various flagship programs. He also criticized the BJP’s alleged promotion of Hindu Rashtra ideology, contrary to the secular and socialist ideals upheld by Bhagat Singh.

  history of class struggle for all those hearts that beats for a just – equitable society, and at the same time that despises Imperialism vehemently. On 23rd March, Comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev, and Rajguru were hanged by the British colonial power in order to crush the ongoing anti-colonial freedom movement. They were influenced by the success of Bolshevik revolution that had left overwhelming impact on these three Indian revolutionaries that led to the formation of HSRA (Hindustan Socialist Revolutionary Association). In the formation of HSRA Comrade Baghat Singh played a fundamental role, and he clearly stated that ruling classes whether of white skin or black skin, we have to continue our struggle against the loot and plunder of all exploiters. But the same exploiters who colluded with the imperialists forces are today celebrating their martyrdom and particularly the leadership of RSS who bitterly opposed Bhagat Singh and his cause. Today BJP the political organ of RSS is upholding all freedom fighters including Com. Bhagat Singh and his comrades. They have no moral right to even speak about freedom fighters and to hijack the freedom movement and now they are distorting it. Our Party CPI (Maoist) pays its revolutionary homage to them and will fight for the fulfillment of their revolutionary dreams.
  <br>
  After the formal independence in 1947 India became a semi-colonial country, and the Indian ruling classes:
  <br>
  comprador big bourgeois and big landlord continued to serve their imperial masters without any hesitation. Entire economic policies of the Indian ruling classes after 1947, was designed to serve the interest of imperialism and native elites. Comprador bourgeois and landlord classes as the owners of the significant number of means of
  <br/>
  production of the country implemented distorted development industrial policy that benefits them, and their Imperialist bosses. Emphasis on industrial policy was to assist the needs of the 1 percent of elite population of India.
  <br/>
  With the entry of finance capital (both in the form of loans and investments) vast scale of dispossession and displacement of the oppressed people happened on an unprecedented manner. Toiling masses of India continued to face unbridled exploitation in more intense manner than before. After 1990s, under the dictates of imperialist forces, Indian ruling classes implemented Liberalization, globalization, and Privatization policies in the country. This measure was a cakewalk for the foreign imperialist capital to loot and plunder the Indian resources, and to accumulate more and more profits. All parliamentary mainstream political parties, irrespective of their party flags have flawlessly implemented LPG policies. This has broken the backbone of Indian economy and has caused unspeakable misery to the toiling masses.
  <br/>
  After BJP came to power in 2014 under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it has turned India into an open
  <br/>
  field for the loot and plunder of the country by the foreign capital under the flagship programs of Make in India, Digital India, One Nation-One Tax, Start- UP India, and many other flagship programs. BJP has enacted several pro- imperialist policies that are against the interest of the board masses of the country. At one hand it is handing over the resources of the country to foreign MNCs, and at the same time it is spreading religious enmity in the country through its agenda of Hindu Rashtra. Com. Bhagat Singh was absolutely against all pro-imperialist policies and communal ideology from which RSS and BJP orginated. Bhagat Singh was totally against Hindu-Rashtra or the idea ofnation based on religion or race. He upholds the idea of scientific reasoning, secularism, and socialism. But, today the Brahmanical Hindutva forces are distorting com. Bhagat Singh ideas to fulfill its agenda of Hindu Rashtra.
  <br/>
  Development in India happens by the usurpation of the lands from the oppressed people. Imperialism to come out from the general crisis look for cheap natural resources that are available in the third world countries. India has abundant deposits of natural resources that mainly lie in the tribal belts of central and Eastern India. To plunder the resources of India, Imperialism has backed every fascist onslaught of its pliant state on the indigenous people of India. To crush the revolutionary Maoist movement in India, the Indian ruling classes in collaboration with the  imperialist carried out several fascist counter-insurgency programs like Salwa Judum, Sendera, Operation Green- Hunt, Operation Samadhan, and now it has unleashed Operation Kagaar. All these fascist genocide of indigenous people was funded, directed and aspired by the global finance and Comprador bureaucratic Capital. In its crisis ridden state, Imperialism has become ferocious, and has given rise to fascist political system in India. Massive deployments of military forces are going on in Central India to expedite the plunder of the natural resources from
  <br/>
  the Adivasi region. People’s resistance to corporatization and militarization of their villages, lands, and forest are being brutally crushed by the Indian state under the BJP’S rule. Every day newspapers in Chhattisgarh carry horrific news of killings of Adivasi by the police forces. It is not happening for the first time, and neither is going to stop until and unless this moribund system of loot and plunder is uprooted from India. The very foundation of capitalism is laid on the massacre of the indigenous population in Africa and in Latin-America. Imperialism in 21st century has developed more brutal machines and deadly weapons to unleash massacres on the struggling masses. Today, the people of India (especially in Central and Eastern India) under the leadership of CPI (Maoist) are fighting against this enemy’s machines and methods.
  <br/>
  Central Committee of CPI (Maoist) gives a call to all democratic, patriotic, working- class, peasantry, dalits, and women’s organizations, well- wishers of the adivasi, students, writers, teachers, lawyers and human rights activists to celebrate 23rd March as an Anti-Imperialism with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. It also appeals to conduct seminars, meetings, rallies upholding the ideas of comrades Bhagat Singh, Sukdev and Rajguru in order to expose the treacherous design of the hindutva forces to saffronize Bhagat Singh and his comrades.

  Am Donnerstag den 21. März fand eine Veranstaltung im Internationalen Zentrum B5 aus Anlass des 18. März, dem Tag der politischen Gefangen und Jahrestag der Pariser Kommune, statt. Zur Veranstaltung lud das Palästina-Bündnis Hamburg ein.
 </p>
<p>
  Begonnen wurde mit einem kulturellen Beitrag, bei dem Aktivistinnen des Roten Bundes das Lied „Die Frauen der Kommune“ sangen. Dann legten diese die Hintergründen des 18. März als Jahrestag der Pariser Kommune, dar. Es wurden die Hintergründe des Aufstands der Pariser Arbeiter, der die Errichtung der Pariser Kommune zufolge hatte, ihre Errungenschaften und ihre Lehren hervorgehoben. Das neu erschienene Interview mit Professor Saibaba, der kürzlich freigelassen wurde, wurde bekannt gegeben.
 </p>
<p>
  Es wurde auch von Young Struggle zur Lage der politischen Gefangenen in der Türkei und Kurdistan berichtet, den Foltermethoden in den Knästen, Gefängnistypen und erläutert, wie das Gefängnissystem zur Unterbringen der revolutionären Gefangen erweitert wurde.
 </p>
<p>
<img alt="Hamburg Veranstaltung 18 März 2" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/HH/2024/Hamburg_-_Veranstaltung_18_März_-2.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/HH/2024/Hamburg_-_Veranstaltung_18_März_-2.png"/>
</p>
<p>
  Von Vertretern des GefangenenInfo wurden auch zu den Hintergründe der Festnahme von Daniela Klette, was ihr Vorgeworfen wird, wie sie gedemütigt wird und von der Kundegebung die am Sonntag den 10. März in Vechta stattgefunden hat, berichtet, wo Solidarität gezeigt wurde. Die Anmelderin der Kundgebung, ein Mitglied des Betriebsrates im Krankenhaus in Bremen, hat in dem Klinikum, in dem sie arbeitet, inzwischen sogar Hausverbot bekommen. Die Repression gegen diese Person hat inzwischen so absurde Züge angenommen, dass wieder Berufsverbote im Raum stehen, nur für politische Ideen die man hat – also grundsätzlich Gesinnungsjustiz.
 </p>
<p>
  In der Diskussion zeigte sich wieder einmal, in den Zeiten in denen die Massen auf der Welt – vor allem in Palästina in diesem Moment – kämpfen und auch in der BRD in Bewegung sind, wichtige Themen auf die Tagesordnung gesetzt werden. So gelangte die Diskussion schnell zu wichtigen Grundfragen revolutionärer Arbeit und vor allem, ob die Revolutionäre noch weiter warten sollen um den Massen den richtigen Weg zur Befreiung zu zeigen, ober ob sie jetzt in der Praxis zeigen müssen wie dieser Kampf zu führen ist. Kurz: Ob es Missionare braucht oder eine tatsächliche revolutionäre Vorhut.

<strong>
   Kathmandu, March 22, 2024:
  </strong>
  KP Sharma Oli, Chairman of the CPN-UML, has dismissed speculations regarding his party’s potential entry into the Socialist Front of Nepal. This came following a discussion with Prime Minister and Chairman of CPN (Maoist Centre), Pushpa Kamal Dahal.
 </p>
<p>
  Contrary to earlier reports suggesting UML’s integration into the Socialist Front of Nepal, Chairman Oli clarified the party’s stance, refuting any such plans.
 </p>
<p>
  The decision came after a meeting between PM Dahal and Chairman Oli, where the matter was deliberated upon.
 </p>
<p>
  Despite the Socialist Front’s earlier decision to extend an invitation to the CPN-UML, Chairman Oli’s statement firmly denies the possibility.
 </p>
<p>
  The Socialist Front of Nepal, formed on June 19, 2023, comprises four parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajwadi Party, and the Communist Party of Nepal led by Netra Bikram Chand.
 </p>
<p>
  With a collective representation of 54 lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the parties affiliated to the newly established Socialist Front of Nepal have made their presence felt in the political arena.

  Milano, corteo contro azienda accusata di esportare armi in Israele
 </h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  LaPresse) - Un centinaio di persone hanno manifestato questa sera a
Milano contro la C.A.B.I. Cattaneo, azienda che produce, tra le altre
cose, componenti per mezzi speciali, marini e aerei, accusata dai
dimostranti di fornire materiali all'esercito israeliano per
alimentare la guerra in corso sulla Striscia di Gaza. "Siamo
davanti alla C.A.B.I. Cattaneo perché è una fabbrica di armi,
attiva nella subacquea e sta collaborando con Leonardo Fincantieri
per fornire i mezzi subacquei alla marina statunitense anche a quella
israeliana, nonostante la guerra in corso contro Gaza il genocidio in
Palestina, l'Italia continua a vendere armi", spiega Arturo di
'Milano per la Palestina', "Questa denuncia del mercanto di armi
e delle fabbriche di produzione di armi continuerà. A Milano non c'è
solo questa e adesso ci stiamo documentando e studiando e faremo
altre iniziative". I manifestanti hanno percorso in corteo le
vie del quartiere dietro lo striscione con scritto 'Blocchiamo chi
arma Israele" ma non hanno mai raggiunto l'ingresso dell'azienda
presidiato da alcune squadre di poliziotti in tenuta antisommossa. Il
corteo è poi proseguito e i manifestanti hanno occupato gli spazi
del centro commerciale di piazza Portello dove sono presenti alcune
attività accusate di finanziare Israele e la guerra di Gaza. Sono
stati urlati slogan contro Biden, Macron, Netanyahu e anche nei
confronti del presidente del consiglio, Giorgia Meloni. Ci sono stati
alcuni momenti di tensione con gli addetti alla sicurezza della
galleria commerciale, subito sedati dagli agenti di polizia presenti
sul posto.

e corteo molto partecipato e con una buona risposta da parte degli

Il corteo a visto la partecipazione delle tante realtà della solidarietà alla Resistenza del Popolo Palestinese e delle sue organizzazioni, che ha messo al centro il ruolo complice dell'imperialismo/fascista del governo Meloni al genocidio a Gaza e in CisGiordania. Mettendo in luce l'altra faccia di questa guerra - quella interna -fatta di tagli a sanità, scuola, servizi e repressione delle lotte sociali

<p>
  In the International Military Tribunal, know as the Nuremberg trial, the Soviet Union together with Yankee, British and French imperialism tried crimes of the European Axis, mainly by the Nazis.
 </p>
<p>
  In the
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/nuremberg-tribunal-charter-1945">
   Charter of the International Military Tribunal
  </a>
  , war crimes is defined as follows:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ War crimes: ‘ namely, violations of the laws or customs of war. Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity;”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  In addition the Soviet Union proposed to include crimes against civilians, which were defined in the Charter as crimes against humanity:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   ‘ Crimes against humanity: ‘ namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The charter also established that not only the individual directly committing an act is responsible for the crime:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   Leaders, organizers, instigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  Regarding war crimes we have already
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/19/gaza-famine-is-imminent/">
   reported
  </a>
  on some of the violation of laws of war committed by the State of Israel. With neglecting to provide necessary supplies to the population under its occupation and further blocking other parties from delivering these supplies, in addition to destroying necessary infrastructure such as water wells and poisoning the groundwater with seawater, the State of Israel is using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. These acts violates

In addition more than 8,000 people are missing, likely dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings. With this the real death toll is likely closer to 2% of the Palestinians in Gaza. The imminent famine and continuing military attacks against civilians point toward even larger parts of the population being murdered. The State of Israel has also forcefully displaced almost

   satellite images
  </a>
  an estimated 157,200 buildings have been damaged or destroyed. In densely populated areas more than half of all buildings have been destroyed. In northern Gaza almost three-fourths of all buildings have been damaged or destroyed. There is no doubt that the State of Israel is committing “
  <em>
   wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity”.

  The mentioned war crimes are also crimes against humanity: “
  <em>
   murder, … deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population
  </em>
  ”. The
  <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf">
   Rome Statute
  </a>
  of the International Criminal Court expands on “
  <em>
   extermination
  </em>
  ” as a crime against humanity:
  <em>
   “’Extermination’ includes the intentional infliction of conditions of life, inter alia the deprivation of access to food and medicine, calculated to bring about the destruction of part of a population”
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The State of Israel is not only committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, they are carrying out a genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. The
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/genocide-conv-1948">
   Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
  </a>
  from 1948, defines genocide as “
  <em>
   any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (a) Killing members of the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

</p>
<p>
<em>
   (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
   (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  We have already explained how the State of Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily harm, and inflicting upon them conditions of life such as starvation. Since last October Israeli officials have at many times publicly revealed their genocidal intention and have made direct and public incitement to genocide. Many examples of these are included in South Africa’s

  </a>
  to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for charging the State of Israel for genocide.
 </p>
<p>
  The Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has made many statements dehumanizing the Palestinian people and called for exterminating them. On the 15

  <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke-start151023">
   stated

   formal address
  </a>
  to the Israeli Knesset, he described the situation as “a struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, between humanity and the law of the jungle”. In his “

<p>
  On the 12

  <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2023-10-13/israeli-president-says-gazans-could-have-risen-up-to-fight-hamas">
   stated
  </a>
  the following in a press conference: “It’s an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.” He has also made
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Isaac_Herzog/status/173933430267074594">
   handwritten messages
  </a>
  on bombs dropped in Gaza.
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’
  <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/defense-minister-announces-complete-siege-of-gaza-no-power-food-or-fuel">
   stated
  </a>
  that Israel was “imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.” He has further made the genocidal plan clear by
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtjHcnNB0E8">
   stating
  </a>
  the following: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.”
 </p>
<p>
  On the 10
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of November the Israeli Minister for National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, clarified the government’s position,
  <a href="https://twitter.com/QudsNen/status/1723784790682358189">
   stating
  </a>
  : “[t]o be clear, when we say that Hamas should be destroyed, it also means those who celebrate, those who support, and those who hand out candy — they’re all terrorists, and they should also be destroyed.”
 </p>
<p>
  The Israeli Minister of Heritage, Amichai Eliyahu,
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyau.a/videos/148918588283326/">
   stated
  </a>
  the following on the 1
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  of November: “The north of the Gaza Strip, more beautiful than ever. Everything is blown up and flattened, simply a pleasure for the eyes … We must talk about the day after. In my mind, we will hand over lots to all those who fought for Gaza over the years and to those evicted from Gush Katif” [a former Israeli settlement].
 </p>
<p>
  Israeli Army Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (‘COGAT’), Major General Ghassan Alian, stated the following in an official
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5a0EWv-o7mE">
   video statement
  </a>
  addressed to Hamas and Gaza residents: “Hamas became ISIS and the citizens of Gaza are celebrating instead of being horrified. Human animals are dealt with accordingly. Israel has imposed a total blockade on Gaza, no electricity, no water, just damage. You wanted hell, you will get hell.”
 </p>
<p>
  Giora Eiland, Israeli Army Reservist Major General, former Head of the Israeli National Security Council, and adviser to the Defense Minister, has, among many genocidal statements, incited genocide by targeting the water supply,
  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5Ow2T0Na20BcoL2yautiobij8ldNsVK/view">
   noting
  </a>
  that water in Gaza “comes from wells with salt water unfit for consumption. They have water treatment plants, Israel should hit those plants.” He has also
  <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sju3uabba">
   stated
  </a>
  that “Israel needs to create a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, compelling tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands to seek refuge in Egypt or the Gulf … Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist”. If the genocidal intentions of the State of Israel was not already clear, Eiland makes sure to clarify this by
  <a href="https://twitter.com/TalulaSha/status/1726267178201362438">
   stating
  </a>
  that: “When senior Israeli figures say in the media ‘It’s either us or them’ we should clarify the question of who is ‘them’. ‘They’ are not only Hamas fighters with weapons, but also all the ‘civilian’ officials, including hospital administrators and school administrators, and also the entire Gaza population who enthusiastically supported Hamas and cheered on its atrocities on October 7th.”
 </p>
<p>
  With the facts of the ongoing genocide being clear, the signatures of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, including the imperialists, are obliged to prevent and punish it.
 </p>
<p>
  However, not only are the imperialists negating this obligation, some of the imperialists are also complicit in the genocide. We already

  to suppress the popular support for the Palestinian people. The British Home Secretary has sent a

   letter
  </a>
  to police chiefs in England and Wales, stating that waving the Palestinian flag, and shouting slogans such as ‘From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free’, may be a criminal offense.” Accordingly German imperialism faces accusations of being complicit in the genocide at the ICJ.
 </p>
<p>
  The imperialists have only widened their support for the genocide since this. Yankee President, Joe Biden, is currently working on giving a further

  that the State of Israel should “take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II” of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

  While we here have focused on crimes committed in the current campaign against Gaza, the peoples of the world will not forget the other crimes committed by the State of Israel since it was established, and the crimes it is currently committing in the West Bank, such as the increasing amount of illegal settlements, as well as the crime of apartheid within the annexed territory.

The refusal of the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize the investigation shall not preclude the presentation of  a subsequent request by the Prosecutor based on new facts or evidence regarding the same situation.  6. If, after the preliminary examination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the Prosecutor concludes that the  information provided does not constitute a reasonable basis for an investigation, he or she shall inform  those who provided the information.

The Prosecutor shall notify  the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the situation before the Court, including any relevant  information and documents. 7. Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the  investigation in respect of a crime of aggression. 8.

Article 17   Issues of admissibility 1. Having regard to paragraph 10 of the Preamble and article 1, the Court shall determine that a case is  inadmissible where:  (a) The case is being investigated or prosecuted by a State which has jurisdiction over it, unless the State  is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution;  6 Inserted by resolution RC/Res.6 of 11 June 2010.<br/>11 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The case has been investigated by a State which has jurisdiction over it and the State has decided not  to prosecute the person concerned, unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of  the State genuinely to prosecute;  (c) The person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint, and  a trial by the Court is not permitted under article 20, paragraph 3;  (d) The case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the Court. 2. In order to determine unwillingness in a particular case, the Court shall consider, having regard to the  principles of due process recognized by international law, whether one or more of the following exist, as  applicable:  (a) The proceedings were or are being undertaken or the national decision was made for the purpose of  shielding the person concerned from criminal responsibility for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court referred to in article 5;  (b) There has been an unjustified delay in the proceedings which in the circumstances is inconsistent  with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice;  (c) The proceedings were not or are not being conducted independently or impartially, and they were or  are being conducted in a manner which, in the circumstances, is inconsistent with an intent to bring  the person concerned to justice. 3. In order to determine inability in a particular case, the Court shall consider whether, due to a total or  substantial collapse or unavailability of its national judicial system, the State is unable to obtain the accused  or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings.  Article 18   Preliminary rulings regarding admissibility 1. When a situation has been referred to the Court pursuant to article 13 (a) and the Prosecutor has determined  that there would be a reasonable basis to commence an investigation, or the Prosecutor initiates an  investigation pursuant to articles 13 (c) and 15, the Prosecutor shall notify all States Parties and those  States which, taking into account the information available, would normally exercise jurisdiction over the  crimes concerned. The Prosecutor may notify such States on a confidential basis and, where the Prosecutor  believes it necessary to protect persons, prevent destruction of evidence or prevent the absconding of  persons, may limit the scope of the information provided to States.  2. Within one month of receipt of that notification, a State may inform the Court that it is investigating or has  investigated its nationals or others within its jurisdiction with respect to criminal acts which may constitute  crimes referred to in article 5 and which relate to the information provided in the notification to States. At  the request of that State, the Prosecutor shall defer to the State's investigation of those persons unless the  Pre-Trial Chamber, on the application of the Prosecutor, decides to authorize the investigation.  3. The Prosecutor's deferral to a State's investigation shall be open to review by the Prosecutor six months  after the date of deferral or at any time when there has been a significant change of circumstances based  on the State's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation.  4. The State concerned or the Prosecutor may appeal to the Appeals Chamber against a ruling of the Pre-Trial  Chamber, in accordance with article 82. The appeal may be heard on an expedited basis.  5. When the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation in accordance with paragraph 2, the Prosecutor may  request that the State concerned periodically inform the Prosecutor of the progress of its investigations and  any subsequent prosecutions. States Parties shall respond to such requests without undue delay.  6. Pending a ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber, or at any time when the Prosecutor has deferred an investigation  under this article, the Prosecutor may, on an exceptional basis, seek authority from the Pre-Trial Chamber  to pursue necessary investigative steps for the purpose of preserving evidence where there is a unique  opportunity to obtain important evidence or there is a significant risk that such evidence may not be  subsequently available.  7. A State which has challenged a ruling of the Pre-Trial Chamber under this article may challenge the  admissibility of a case under article 19 on the grounds of additional significant facts or significant change  of circumstances. <br/>12 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 19   Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court or the admissibility of a case 1. The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it. The Court may, on its own  motion, determine the admissibility of a case in accordance with article 17. 2. Challenges to the admissibility of a case on the grounds referred to in article 17 or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court may be made by:  (a) An accused or a person for whom a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear has been issued under  article 58;  (b) A State which has jurisdiction over a case, on the ground that it is investigating or prosecuting the  case or has investigated or prosecuted; or  (c) A State from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12. 3. The Prosecutor may seek a ruling from the Court regarding a question of jurisdiction or admissibility. In  proceedings with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility, those who have referred the situation under article  13, as well as victims, may also submit observations to the Court.  4. The admissibility of a case or the jurisdiction of the Court may be challenged only once by any person or  State referred to in paragraph 2. The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the  trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than  once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the  commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17,  paragraph 1 (c).  5. A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.  6. Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the  jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber. After confirmation of the charges,  they shall be referred to the Trial Chamber. Decisions with respect to jurisdiction or admissibility may be  appealed to the Appeals Chamber in accordance with article 82.  7. If a challenge is made by a State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) or (c), the Prosecutor shall suspend the  investigation until such time as the Court makes a determination in accordance with article 17.  8. Pending a ruling by the Court, the Prosecutor may seek authority from the Court:  (a) To pursue necessary investigative steps of the kind referred to in article 18, paragraph 6;  (b) To take a statement or testimony from a witness or complete the collection and examination of  evidence which had begun prior to the making of the challenge; and  (c) In cooperation with the relevant States, to prevent the absconding of persons in respect of whom the  Prosecutor has already requested a warrant of arrest under article 58. 9. The making of a challenge shall not affect the validity of any act performed by the Prosecutor or any order  or warrant issued by the Court prior to the making of the challenge.  10. If the Court has decided that a case is inadmissible under article 17, the Prosecutor may submit a request for  a review of the decision when he or she is fully satisfied that new facts have arisen which negate the basis  on which the case had previously been found inadmissible under article 17.  11. If the Prosecutor, having regard to the matters referred to in article 17, defers an investigation, the Prosecutor  may request that the relevant State make available to the Prosecutor information on the proceedings. That  information shall, at the request of the State concerned, be confidential. If the Prosecutor thereafter decides  to proceed with an investigation, he or she shall notify the State to which deferral of the proceedings has  taken place. <br/>13 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 207  Ne bis in idem 1.

The definition of a crime shall be strictly construed and shall not be extended by analogy. In case of  ambiguity, the definition shall be interpreted in favour of the person being investigated, prosecuted or  convicted.  3. This article shall not affect the characterization of any conduct as criminal under international law  independently of this Statute.  Article 23   Nulla poena sine leg e A person convicted by the Court may be punished only in accordance with this Statute. Article 24   Non-retroactivity ratione personae 1. No person shall be criminally responsible under this Statute for conduct prior to the entry into force of the  Statute.  2. In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement, the law more  favourable to the person being investigated, prosecuted or convicted shall apply. Article 258  Individual criminal responsibility 1. The Court shall have jurisdiction over natural persons pursuant to this Statute. 2. A person who commits a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court shall be individually responsible and  liable for punishment in accordance with this Statute.  3. In accordance with this Statute, a person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a  crime within the jurisdiction of the Court if that person:  (a) Commits such a crime, whether as an individual, jointly with another or through another person,  regardless of whether that other person is criminally responsible;  (b) Orders, solicits or induces the commission of such a crime which in fact occurs or is attempted;  (c) For the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets or otherwise assists in its  commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission;  (d) In any other way contributes to the commission or attempted commission of such a crime by a group  of persons acting with a common purpose.

In particular,  official capacity as a Head of State or Government, a member of a Government or parliament, an elected  representative or a government official shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under  this Statute, nor shall it, in and of itself, constitute a ground for reduction of sentence.  2. Immunities or special procedural rules which may attach to the official capacity of a person, whether under  national or international law, shall not bar the Court from exercising its jurisdiction over such a person. Article 28   Responsibility of commanders and other superiors In addition to other grounds of criminal responsibility under this Statute for crimes within the jurisdiction of the  Court:  (a) A military commander or person effectively acting as a military commander shall be criminally  responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by forces under his or her  effective command and control, or effective authority and control as the case may be, as a result of his  or her failure to exercise control properly over such forces, where:  (i) That military commander or person either knew or, owing to the circumstances at the time,  should have known that the forces were committing or about to commit such crimes; and  (ii) That military commander or person failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures  within his or her power to prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the  competent authorities for investigation and prosecution.  (b) With respect to superior and subordinate relationships not described in paragraph (a), a superior shall  be criminally responsible for crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court committed by subordinates  under his or her effective authority and control, as a result of his or her failure to exercise control  properly over such subordinates, where:  (i) The superior either knew, or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated, that  the subordinates were committing or about to commit such crimes;  (ii) The crimes concerned activities that were within the effective responsibility and control of the  superior; and  (iii) The superior failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to  prevent or repress their commission or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for  investigation and prosecution.

The fact that the person was involved in a defensive operation conducted by forces shall  not in itself constitute a ground for excluding criminal responsibility under this subparagraph;  (d) The conduct which is alleged to constitute a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been  caused by duress resulting from a threat of imminent death or of continuing or imminent serious  bodily harm against that person or another person, and the person acts necessarily and reasonably  to avoid this threat, provided that the person does not intend to cause a greater harm than the one  sought to be avoided. Such a threat may either be:  (i) Made by other persons; or  (ii) Constituted by other circumstances beyond that person's control. 2. The Court shall determine the applicability of the grounds for excluding criminal responsibility provided for  in this Statute to the case before it.  3. At trial, the Court may consider a ground for excluding criminal responsibility other than those referred to  in paragraph 1 where such a ground is derived from applicable law as set forth in article 21. The procedures  relating to the consideration of such a ground shall be provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 32   Mistake of fact or mistake of law 1. A mistake of fact shall be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility only if it negates the mental element  required by the crime.  2. A mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility. A mistake of law may, however, be a ground for  excluding criminal responsibility if it negates the mental element required by such a crime, or as provided  for in article 33.  Article 33   Superior orders and prescription of law 1. The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an  order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal  responsibility unless:  (a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;  (b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and  (c) The order was not manifestly unlawful. 2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful. <br/>17 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 4.

INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION Article 53   Initiation of an investigation 1. The Prosecutor shall, having evaluated the information made available to him or her, initiate an investigation  unless he or she determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed under this Statute. In deciding  whether to initiate an investigation, the Prosecutor shall consider whether:  (a) The information available to the Prosecutor provides a reasonable basis to believe that a crime within  the jurisdiction of the Court has been or is being committed;  (b) The case is or would be admissible under article 17; and  (c) Taking into account the gravity of the crime and the interests of victims, there are nonetheless  substantial reasons to believe that an investigation would not serve the interests of justice. If the Prosecutor determines that there is no reasonable basis to proceed and his or her determination is  based solely on subparagraph (c) above, he or she shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  2. If, upon investigation, the Prosecutor concludes that there is not a sufficient basis for a prosecution because:  (a) There is not a sufficient legal or factual basis to seek a warrant or summons under article 58;  (b) The case is inadmissible under article 17; or  (c) A prosecution is not in the interests of justice, taking into account all the circumstances, including the  gravity of the crime, the interests of victims and the age or infirmity of the alleged perpetrator, and his  or her role in the alleged crime;  the Prosecutor shall inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and the State making a referral under article 14 or the  Security Council in a case under article 13, paragraph (b), of his or her conclusion and the reasons for the  conclusion.  3. (a) At the request of the State making a referral under article 14 or the Security Council under article 13,  paragraph (b), the Pre-Trial Chamber may review a decision of the Prosecutor under paragraph 1 or  2  not to proceed and mayrequest the Prosecutor to reconsider that decision.  (b) In addition, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own initiative, review a decision of the Prosecutor not  to proceed if it is based solely on paragraph 1 (c) or 2 (c). In such a case, the decision of the Prosecutor  shall be effective only if confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber.  4. The Prosecutor may, at any time, reconsider a decision whether to initiate an investigation or prosecution  based on new facts or information.  Article 54   Duties and powers of the Prosecutor with respect to investigations 1. The Prosecutor shall:  (a) In order to establish the truth, extend the investigation to cover all facts and evidence relevant to an  assessment of whether there is criminal responsibility under this Statute, and, in doing so, investigate  incriminating and exonerating circumstances equally;  (b) Take appropriate measures to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of crimes within the  jurisdiction of the Court, and in doing so, respect the interests and personal circumstances of victims  and witnesses, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and take into  account the nature of the crime, in particular where it involves sexual violence, gender violence or  violence against children; and  (c) Fully respect the rights of persons arising under this Statute. 2.

Where there are grounds to believe that a person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court  and that person is about to be questioned either by the Prosecutor, or by national authorities pursuant to  a request made under Part 9, that person shall also have the following rights of which he or she shall be  informed prior to being questioned:  (a) To be informed, prior to being questioned, that there are grounds to believe that he or she has  committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;  (b) To remain silent, without such silence being a consideration in the determination of guilt or innocence;  (c) To have legal assistance of the person's choosing, or, if the person does not have legal assistance, to  have legal assistance assigned to him or her, in any case where the interests of justice so require, and  without payment by the person in any such case if the person does not have sufficient means to pay  for it; and  (d) To be questioned in the presence of counsel unless the person has voluntarily waived his or her right  to counsel. Article 56   Role of the Pre-Trial Chamber in relation to a unique investigative opportunity 1. (a) Where the Prosecutor considers an investigation to present a unique opportunity to take testimony or    a statement from a witness or to examine, collect or test evidence, which may not be available     subsequently for the purposes of a trial, the Prosecutor shall so inform the Pre-Trial Chamber.  (b) In that case, the Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor, take such measures as may  be necessary to ensure the efficiency and integrity of the proceedings and, in particular, to protect the  rights of the defence.  (c) Unless the Pre-Trial Chamber orders otherwise, the Prosecutor shall provide the relevant information  to the person who has been arrested or appeared in response to a summons in connection with the  investigation referred to in subparagraph (a), in order that he or she may be heard on the matter. <br/>26 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 (b) may include:  (a) Making recommendations or orders regarding procedures to be followed;  (b) Directing that a record be made of the proceedings;  (c) Appointing an expert to assist;  (d) Authorizing counsel for a person who has been arrested, or appeared before the Court in response to  a summons, to participate, or where there has not yet been such an arrest or appearance or counsel  has not been designated, appointing another counsel to attend and represent the interests of the  defence;  (e) Naming one of its members or, if necessary, another available judge of the Pre-Trial or Trial Division to  observe and make recommendations or orders regarding the collection and preservation of evidence  and the questioning of persons;  (f) Taking such other action as may be necessary to collect or preserve evidence. 3. (a) Where the Prosecutor has not sought measures pursuant to this article but the Pre-Trial  Chamberconsiders that such measures are required to preserve evidence that it deems would be  essential for the defence at trial, it shall consult with the Prosecutor as to whether there is good reason  for the Prosecutor's failure to request the measures. If upon consultation, the Pre-Trial Chamber  concludes that the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Pre-Trial Chamber  may take such measures on its own initiative.  (b) A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber to act on its own initiative under this paragraph may be   appealedby the Prosecutor. The appeal shall be heard on an expedited basis.  4. The admissibility of evidence preserved or collected for trial pursuant to this article, or the record thereof,  shall be governed at trial by article 69, and given such weight as determined by the Trial Chamber.

In addition to its other functions under this Statute, the Pre-Trial Chamber may:  (a) At the request of the Prosecutor, issue such orders and warrants as may be required for the purposes  of an investigation;  (b) Upon the request of a person who has been arrested or has appeared pursuant to a summons under  article 58, issue such orders, including measures such as those described in article 56, or seek such  cooperation pursuant to Part 9 as may be necessary to assist the person in the preparation of his or  her defence;  (c) Where necessary, provide for the protection and privacy of victims and witnesses, the preservation of  evidence, the protection of persons who have been arrested or appeared in response to a summons,  and the protection of national security information;  (d) Authorize the Prosecutor to take specific investigative steps within the territory of a State Party  without having secured the cooperation of that State under Part 9 if, whenever possible having regard  to the views of the State concerned, the Pre-Trial Chamber has determined in that case that the State  is clearly unable to execute a request for cooperation due to the unavailability of any authority or any  component of its judicial system competent to execute the request for cooperation under Part 9;  (e) Where a warrant of arrest or a summons has been issued under article 58, and having due regard to  the strength of the evidence and the rights of the parties concerned, as provided for in this Statute  and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, seek the cooperation of States pursuant to article 93,  paragraph 1 (k), to take protective measures for the purpose of forfeiture, in particular for the ultimate  benefit of victims.<br/>27 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 58   Issuance by the Pre-Trial Chamber of a warrant of arrest or a summons to appear 1. At any time after the initiation of an investigation, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the application of the  Prosecutor, issue a warrant of arrest of a person if, having examined the application and the evidence or  other information submitted by the Prosecutor, it is satisfied that:  (a) There are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction  of the Court; and  (b) The arrest of the person appears necessary:  (i) To ensure the person's appearance at trial;  (ii) To ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court  proceedings; or  (iii) Where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or  a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same  circumstances. 2. The application of the Prosecutor shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed;  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes;  (d) A summary of the evidence and any other information which establish reasonable grounds to believe  that the person committed those crimes; and  (e) The reason why the Prosecutor believes that the arrest of the person is necessary. 3. The warrant of arrest shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court for which the person's arrest is  sought; and  (c) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those crimes. 4.

The Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to amend the warrant of arrest by modifying or adding  to the crimes specified therein. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall so amend the warrant if it is satisfied that there  are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the modified or additional crimes.  7. As an alternative to seeking a warrant of arrest, the Prosecutor may submit an application requesting that  the Pre-Trial Chamber issue a summons for the person to appear. If the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person committed the crime alleged and that a summons  is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance, it shall issue the summons, with or without conditions  restricting liberty (other than detention) if provided for by national law, for the person to appear. The  summons shall contain:  (a) The name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;  (b) The specified date on which the person is to appear;  (c) A specific reference to the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court which the person is alleged to  have committed; and  (d) A concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute the crime.

A State Party which has received a request for provisional arrest or for arrest and surrender shall immediately  take steps to arrest the person in question in accordance with its laws and the provisions of Part 9.  2. A person arrested shall be brought promptly before the competent judicial authority in the custodial State  which shall determine, in accordance with the law of that State, that:  (a) The warrant applies to that person;  (b) The person has been arrested in accordance with the proper process; and  (c) The person's rights have been respected. 3. The person arrested shall have the right to apply to the competent authority in the custodial State for  interim release pending surrender.  4. In reaching a decision on any such application, the competent authority in the custodial State shall consider  whether, given the gravity of the alleged crimes, there are urgent and exceptional circumstances to justify  interim release and whether necessary safeguards exist to ensure that the custodial State can fulfil its duty  to surrender the person to the Court. It shall not be open to the competent authority of the custodial State  to consider whether the warrant of arrest was properly issued in accordance with article 58, paragraph 1 (a)  and (b).  5. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall be notified of any request for interim release and shall make recommendations  to the competent authority in the custodial State. The competent authority in the custodial State shall give  full consideration to such recommendations, including any recommendations on measures to prevent the  escape of the person, before rendering its decision.  6. If the person is granted interim release, the Pre-Trial Chamber may request periodic reports on the status  of the interim release.  7. Once ordered to be surrendered by the custodial State, the person shall be delivered to the Court as soon  as possible.  Article 60   Initial proceedings before the Court 1. Upon the surrender of the person to the Court, or the person's appearance before the Court voluntarily or  pursuant to a summons, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall satisfy itself that the person has been informed of the  crimes which he or she is alleged to have committed, and of his or her rights under this Statute, including  the right to apply for interim release pending trial.  2. A person subject to a warrant of arrest may apply for interim release pending trial. If the Pre-Trial Chamber  is satisfied that the conditions set forth in article 58, paragraph 1, are met, the person shall continue to be  detained. If it is not so satisfied, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall release the person, with or without conditions.  3. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall periodically review its ruling on the release or detention of the person, and  may do so at any time on the request of the Prosecutor or the person. Upon such review, it may modify  its ruling as to detention, release or conditions of release, if it is satisfied that changed circumstances so  require.  4. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall ensure that a person is not detained for an unreasonable period prior to trial  due to inexcusable delay by the Prosecutor. If such delay occurs, the Court shall consider releasing the  person, with or without conditions.  5. If necessary, the Pre-Trial Chamber may issue a warrant of arrest to secure the presence of a person who  has been released.  Article 61   Confirmation of the charges before trial 1. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2, within a reasonable time after the person's surrender or voluntary  appearance before the Court, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall hold a hearing to confirm the charges on which  the Prosecutor intends to seek trial. The hearing shall be held in the presence of the Prosecutor and the  person charged, as well as his or her counsel. <br/>29 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Pre-Trial Chamber may, upon request of the Prosecutor or on its own motion, hold a hearing in the  absence of the person charged to confirm the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to seek trial when  the person has:  (a) Waived his or her right to be present; or  (b) Fled or cannot be found and all reasonable steps have been taken to secure his or her appearance  before the Court and to inform the person of the charges and that a hearing to confirm those charges  will be held. In that case, the person shall be represented by counsel where the Pre-Trial Chamber determines that it is  in the interests of justice.  3. Within a reasonable time before the hearing, the person shall:  (a) Be provided with a copy of the document containing the charges on which the Prosecutor intends to  bring the person to trial; and  (b) Be informed of the evidence on which the Prosecutor intends to rely at the hearing.  The Pre-Trial Chamber may issue orders regarding the disclosure of information for the purposes of the  hearing.  4. Before the hearing, the Prosecutor may continue the investigation and may amend or withdraw any charges.  The person shall be given reasonable notice before the hearing of any amendment to or withdrawal of  charges. In case of a withdrawal of charges, the Prosecutor shall notify the Pre-Trial Chamber of the reasons  for the withdrawal.  5. At the hearing, the Prosecutor shall support each charge with sufficient evidence to establish substantial  grounds to believe that the person committed the crime charged. The Prosecutor may rely on documentary  or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to testify at the trial.  6. At the hearing, the person may:  (a) Object to the charges;  (b) Challenge the evidence presented by the Prosecutor; and  (c) Present evidence. 7. The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there is sufficient evidence to  establish substantial grounds to believe that the person committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its  determination, the Pre-Trial Chamber shall:  (a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is sufficient evidence, and  commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the charges as confirmed;  (b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is insufficient  evidence;  (c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:  (i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with respect to a particular  charge; or  (ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a different crime  within the jurisdiction of the Court. 8. Where the Pre-Trial Chamber declines to confirm a charge, the Prosecutor shall not be precluded from  subsequently requesting its confirmation if the request is supported by additional evidence.  9. After the charges are confirmed and before the trial has begun, the Prosecutor may, with the permission  of the Pre-Trial Chamber and after notice to the accused, amend the charges. If the Prosecutor seeks to  add additional charges or to substitute more serious charges, a hearing under this article to confirm those  charges must be held. After commencement of the trial, the Prosecutor may, with the permission of the Trial  Chamber, withdraw the charges.  10. Any warrant previously issued shall cease to have effect with respect to any charges which have not been  confirmed by the Pre-Trial Chamber or which have been withdrawn by the Prosecutor. <br/>30 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court11. Once the charges have been confirmed in accordance with this article, the Presidency shall constitute a Trial  Chamber which, subject to paragraph 9 and to article 64, paragraph 4, shall be responsible for the conduct  of subsequent proceedings and may exercise any function of the Pre-Trial Chamber that is relevant and  capable of application in those proceedings. <br/>31 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 6.

Where the Trial Chamber is satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it shall  consider the admission of guilt, together with any additional evidence presented, as establishing all the  essential facts that are required to prove the crime to which the admission of guilt relates, and may convict  the accused of that crime.  3. Where the Trial Chamber is not satisfied that the matters referred to in paragraph 1 are established, it  shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made, in which case it shall order that the trial be  continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute and may remit the case to another  Trial Chamber.  4. Where the Trial Chamber is of the opinion that a more complete presentation of the facts of the case is  required in the interests of justice, in particular the interests of the victims, the Trial Chamber may:  (a) Request the Prosecutor to present additional evidence, including the testimony of witnesses; or  (b) Order that the trial be continued under the ordinary trial procedures provided by this Statute, in  which case it shall consider the admission of guilt as not having been made and may remit the case  to another Trial Chamber. 5.

In so doing, the Court shall have regard to all relevant  factors, including age, gender as defined in article 7, paragraph 3, and health, and the nature of the crime,  in particular, but not limited to, where the crime involves sexual or gender violence or violence against  children. The Prosecutor shall take such measures particularly during the investigation and prosecution of  such crimes.

The Court shall have  the authority to request the submission of all evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of  the truth.  4.

The Court shall respect and observe privileges on confidentiality as provided for in the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence.  6. The Court shall not require proof of facts of common knowledge but may take judicial notice of them.  7.

Such cases include those falling within the  scope of article 56, paragraphs 2 and 3, article 61, paragraph 3, article 64, paragraph 3, article 67, paragraph  2, article 68, paragraph 6, article 87, paragraph 6 and article 93, as well as cases arising at any other stage of  the proceedings where such disclosure may be at issue.  2. This article shall also apply when a person who has been requested to give information or evidence has  refused to do so or has referred the matter to the State on the ground that disclosure would prejudice  the national security interests of a State and the State concerned confirms that it is of the opinion that  disclosure would prejudice its national security interests.  3. Nothing in this article shall prejudice the requirements of confidentiality applicable under article 54,  paragraph 3 (e) and (f), or the application of article 73.  4. If a State learns that information or documents of the State are being, or are likely to be, disclosed at  any stage of the proceedings, and it is of the opinion that disclosure would prejudice its national security  interests, that State shall have the right to intervene in order to obtain resolution of the issue in accordance  with this article.  5. If, in the opinion of a State, disclosure of information would prejudice its national security interests, all  reasonable steps will be taken by the State, acting in conjunction with the Prosecutor, the defence or  the Pre-Trial Chamber or Trial Chamber, as the case may be, to seek to resolve the matter by cooperative  means. Such steps may include:  (a) Modification or clarification of the request;  (b) A determination by the Court regarding the relevance of the information or evidence sought, or a  determination as to whether the evidence, though relevant, could be or has been obtained from a  source other than the requested State;  (c) Obtaining the information or evidence from a different source or in a different form; or  (d) Agreement on conditions under which the assistance could be provided including, among other  things, providing summaries or redactions, limitations on disclosure, use of in camera or ex parte   proceedings, or other protective measures permissible under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure  and Evidence. 6. Once all reasonable steps have been taken to resolve the matter through cooperative means, and if the  State considers that there are no means or conditions under which the information or documents could  be provided or disclosed without prejudice to its national security interests, it shall so notify the Prosecutor  or the Court of the specific reasons for its decision, unless a specific description of the reasons would itself  necessarily result in such prejudice to the State's national security interests.<br/>36 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court7. Thereafter, if the Court determines that the evidence is relevant and necessary for the establishment of the  guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court may undertake the following actions:  (a) Where disclosure of the information or document is sought pursuant to a request for cooperation  under Part 9 or the circumstances described in paragraph 2, and the State has invoked the ground for  refusal referred to in article 93, paragraph 4:  (i) The Court may, before making any conclusion referred to in subparagraph 7 (a) (ii), request  further consultations for the purpose of considering the State's representations, which may  include, as appropriate, hearings in camera and ex parte ;  (ii) If the Court concludes that, by invoking the ground for refusal under article 93, paragraph  4, in the circumstances of the case, the requested State is not acting in accordance with its  obligations under this Statute, the Court may refer the matter in accordance with article 87,  paragraph 7, specifying the reasons for its conclusion; and  (iii) The Court may make such inference in the trial of the accused as to the existence or non- existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances; or  (b) In all other circumstances:  (i) Order disclosure; or  (ii) To the extent it does not order disclosure, make such inference in the trial of the accused as to  the existence or non-existence of a fact, as may be appropriate in the circumstances. Article 73   Third-party information or documents If a State Party is requested by the Court to provide a document or information in its custody, possession or  control, which was disclosed to it in confidence by a State, intergovernmental organization or international  organization, it shall seek the consent of the originator to disclose that document or information. If the originator  is a State Party, it shall either consent to disclosure of the information or document or undertake to resolve the  issue of disclosure with the Court, subject to the provisions of article 72. If the originator is not a State Party  and refuses to consent to disclosure, the requested State shall inform the Court that it is unable to provide the  document or information because of a pre-existing obligation of confidentiality to the originator.  Article 74   Requirements for the decision 1. All the judges of the Trial Chamber shall be present at each stage of the trial and throughout their  deliberations.

The Trial Chamber's decision shall be based on its evaluation of the evidence and the entire proceedings.  The decision shall not exceed the facts and circumstances described in the charges and any amendments  to the charges.

Article 75   Reparations to victims 1. The Court shall establish principles relating to reparations to, or in respect of, victims, including restitution,  compensation and rehabilitation. On this basis, in its decision the Court may, either upon request or on its  own motion in exceptional circumstances, determine the scope and extent of any damage, loss and injury  to, or in respect of, victims and will state the principles on which it is acting. <br/>37 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The Court may make an order directly against a convicted person specifying appropriate reparations to, or  in respect of, victims, including restitution, compensation and rehabilitation.  Where appropriate, the Court may order that the award for reparations be made through the Trust Fund  provided for in article 79. 3. Before making an order under this article, the Court may invite and shall take account of representations  from or on behalf of the convicted person, victims, other interested persons or interested States.  4. In exercising its power under this article, the Court may, after a person is convicted of a crime within the  jurisdiction of the Court, determine whether, in order to give effect to an order which it may make under  this article, it is necessary to seek measures under article 93, paragraph 1.  5. A State Party shall give effect to a decision under this article as if the provisions of article 109 were applicable  to this article.  6. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prejudicing the rights of victims under national or international  law.  Article 76   Sentencing 1.

This period shall be no less than  the highest individual sentence pronounced and shall not exceed 30 years imprisonment or a sentence of  life imprisonment in conformity with article 77, paragraph 1 (b). Article 79   Trust Fund 1. A Trust Fund shall be established by decision of the Assembly of States Parties for the benefit of victims of  crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court, and of the families of such victims.  2.

(a) A sentence may be appealed, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, by the     Prosecutor or the convicted person on the ground of disproportion between the crime and the     sentence;  (b) If on an appeal against sentence the Court considers that there are grounds on which the conviction  might be set aside, wholly or in part, it may invite the Prosecutor and the convicted person to  submit grounds under article 81, paragraph 1 (a) or (b), and may render a decision on conviction in  accordance with article 83;  (c) The same procedure applies when the Court, on an appeal against conviction only, considers that  there are grounds to reduce the sentence under paragraph 2 (a).  3. (a) Unless the Trial Chamber orders otherwise, a convicted person shall remain in custody pending    an appeal;  (b) When a convicted person's time in custody exceeds the sentence of imprisonment imposed, that  person shall be released, except that if the Prosecutor is also appealing, the release may be subject to  the conditions under subparagraph (c) below;  (c) In case of an acquittal, the accused shall be released immediately, subject to the following:  (i) Under exceptional circumstances, and having regard, inter alia , to the concrete risk of flight, the  seriousness of the offence charged and the probability of success on appeal, the Trial Chamber,  at the request of the Prosecutor, may maintain the detention of the person pending appeal;  (ii) A decision by the Trial Chamber under subparagraph (c) (i) may be appealed in accordance  with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 4.

A decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber under article 57, paragraph 3 (d), may be appealed against by the State  concerned or by the Prosecutor, with the leave of the Pre-Trial Chamber. The appeal shall be heard on an  expedited basis.  3. An appeal shall not of itself have suspensive effect unless the Appeals Chamber so orders, upon request, in  accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  4. A legal representative of the victims, the convicted person or a bona fide owner of property adversely  affected by an order under article 75 may appeal against the order for reparations, as provided in the Rules  of Procedure and Evidence. Article 83   Proceedings on appeal 1. For the purposes of proceedings under article 81 and this article, the Appeals Chamber shall have all the  powers of the Trial Chamber.  2. If the Appeals Chamber finds that the proceedings appealed from were unfair in a way that affected the  reliability of the decision or sentence, or that the decision or sentence appealed from was materially affected  by error of fact or law or procedural error, it may:  (a) Reverse or amend the decision or sentence; or  (b) Order a new trial before a different Trial Chamber. For these purposes, the Appeals Chamber may remand a factual issue to the original Trial Chamber for it  to determine the issue and to report back accordingly, or may itself call evidence to determine the issue.  When the decision or sentence has been appealed only by the person convicted, or the Prosecutor on that  person's behalf, it cannot be amended to his or her detriment.  3.

The Appeals Chamber shall reject the application if it considers it to be unfounded. If it determines that the  application is meritorious, it may, as appropriate:  (a) Reconvene the original Trial Chamber;  (b) Constitute a new Trial Chamber; or <br/>41 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(c) Retain jurisdiction over the matter, with a view to, after hearing the parties in the manner set forth in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence,  arriving at a determination on whether the judgement should be revised.  Article 85   Compensation to an arrested or convicted person 1. Anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention shall have an enforceable right to  compensation.  2. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence, and when subsequently his or  her conviction has been reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively  that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such  conviction shall be compensated according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the  unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable to him or her.  3. In exceptional circumstances, where the Court finds conclusive facts showing that there has been a grave  and manifest miscarriage of justice, it may in its discretion award compensation, according to the criteria  provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, to a person who has been released from detention  following a final decision of acquittal or a termination of the proceedings for that reason. <br/>42 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 9.

The Court may  request that any information that is made available under this Part shall be provided and handled in a  manner that protects the safety and physical or psychological well-being of any victims, potential witnesses  and their families.  5. (a) The Court may invite any State not party to this Statute to provide assistance under this Part on the  basis of an ad hoc arrangement, an agreement with such State or any other appropriate basis.  (b) Where a State not party to this Statute, which has entered into an ad hoc arrangement or an  agreement with the Court, fails to cooperate with requests pursuant to any such arrangement or  agreement, the Court may so inform the Assembly of States Parties or, where the Security Council  referred the matter to the Court, the Security Council.  6. The Court may ask any intergovernmental organization to provide information or documents. The Court  may also ask for other forms of cooperation and assistance which may be agreed upon with such an  organization and which are in accordance with its competence or mandate.  7. Where a State Party fails to comply with a request to cooperate by the Court contrary to the provisions of  this Statute, thereby preventing the Court from exercising its functions and powers under this Statute, the  Court may make a finding to that effect and refer the matter to the Assembly of States Parties or, where the  Security Council referred the matter to the Court, to the Security Council.  Article 88   Availability of procedures under national law States Parties shall ensure that there are procedures available under their national law for all of the forms of  cooperation which are specified under this Part.

If the case is admissible, the  requested State shall proceed with the execution of the request. If an admissibility ruling is pending, the  requested State may postpone the execution of the request for surrender of the person until the Court  makes a determination on admissibility.  3. (a) A State Party shall authorize, in accordance with its national procedural law, transportation through     its territory of a person being surrendered to the Court by another State, except where transit through     that State would impede or delay the surrender.

The transit State shall detain the  person being transported until the request for transit is received and the transit is effected, provided  that detention for purposes of this subparagraph may not be extended beyond 96 hours from the  unscheduled landing unless the request is received within that time.  4. If the person sought is being proceeded against or is serving a sentence in the requested State for a crime  different from that for which surrender to the Court is sought, the requested State, after making its decision  to grant the request, shall consult with the Court.  Article 90   Competing requests 1. A State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person under article 89 shall, if  it also receives a request from any other State for the extradition of the same person for the same conduct  which forms the basis of the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender, notify the Court and  the requesting State of that fact.  2. Where the requesting State is a State Party, the requested State shall give priority to the request from the  Court if:  (a) The Court has, pursuant to article 18 or 19, made a determination that the case in respect of which  surrender is sought is admissible and that determination takes into account the investigation or  prosecution conducted by the requesting State in respect of its request for extradition; or  (b) The Court makes the determination described in subparagraph (a) pursuant to the requested State's  notification under paragraph 1. 3. Where a determination under paragraph 2 (a) has not been made, the requested State may, at its discretion,  pending the determination of the Court under paragraph 2 (b), proceed to deal with the request for  extradition from the requesting State but shall not extradite the person until the Court has determined that  the case is inadmissible. The Court's determination shall be made on an expedited basis.  4. If the requesting State is a State not Party to this Statute the requested State, if it is not under an international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State, shall give priority to the request for surrender  from the Court, if the Court has determined that the case is admissible.  5. Where a case under paragraph 4 has not been determined to be admissible by the Court, the requested  State may, at its discretion, proceed to deal with the request for extradition from the requesting State.  6. In cases where paragraph 4 applies except that the requested State is under an existing international  obligation to extradite the person to the requesting State not Party to this Statute, the requested State shall  determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or extradite the person to the requesting State. In  making its decision, the requested State shall consider all the relevant factors, including but not limited to: <br/>44 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(a) The respective dates of the requests;  (b) The interests of the requesting State including, where relevant, whether the crime was committed in  its territory and the nationality of the victims and of the person sought; and  (c) The possibility of subsequent surrender between the Court and the requesting State. 7. Where a State Party which receives a request from the Court for the surrender of a person also receives a  request from any State for the extradition of the same person for conduct other than that which constitutes  the crime for which the Court seeks the person's surrender:  (a) The requested State shall, if it is not under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, give priority to the request from the Court;  (b) The requested State shall, if it is under an existing international obligation to extradite the person  to the requesting State, determine whether to surrender the person to the Court or to extradite  the person to the requesting State. In making its decision, the requested State shall consider all  the relevant factors, including but not limited to those set out in paragraph 6, but shall give special  consideration to the relative nature and gravity of the conduct in question. 8. Where pursuant to a notification under this article, the Court has determined a case to be inadmissible, and  subsequently extradition to the requesting State is refused, the requested State shall notify the Court of this  decision.

If after consultations the matter cannot be resolved, the Court shall modify the  request as necessary.  4.

Before denying a request for assistance under paragraph 1 (l), the requested State shall consider whether  the assistance can be provided subject to specified conditions, or whether the assistance can be provided at  a later date or in an alternative manner, provided that if the Court or the Prosecutor accepts the assistance  subject to conditions, the Court or the Prosecutor shall abide by them.  6. If a request for assistance is denied, the requested State Party shall promptly inform the Court or the  Prosecutor of the reasons for such denial.  7. (a) The Court may request the temporary transfer of a person in custody for purposes of identification or     for obtaining testimony or other assistance.

They may then be used as evidence pursuant to  the provisions of Parts 5 and 6 and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  9. (a) (i) In the event that a State Party receives competing requests, other than for surrender or      extradition, from the Court and from another  State pursuant to an international obligation,      the State Party shall endeavour, in consultation with the Court and the other State, to meet      both requests, if necessary by postponing or attaching conditions to one or the other request.  (ii) Failing that, competing requests shall be resolved in accordance with the principles established  in article 90.  (b) Where, however, the request from the Court concerns information, property or persons which are  subject to the control of a third State or an international organization by virtue of an international  agreement, the requested States shall so inform the Court and the Court shall direct its request to the  third State or international organization.  10.

(c) The Court may, under the conditions set out in this paragraph, grant a request for assistance under  this paragraph from a State which is not a Party to this Statute.  Article 94   Postponement of execution of a request in respect of ongoing investigation or prosecution 1. If the immediate execution of a request would interfere with an ongoing investigation or prosecution of  a case different from that to which the request relates, the requested State may postpone the execution  of the request for a period of time agreed upon with the Court. However, the postponement shall be  no longer than is necessary to complete the relevant investigation or prosecution in the requested State.  Before making a decision to postpone, the requested State should consider whether the assistance may be  immediately provided subject to certain conditions.  2. If a decision to postpone is taken pursuant to paragraph 1, the Prosecutor may, however, seek measures to  preserve evidence, pursuant to article 93, paragraph 1 (j).

Such problems may include, inter alia :  (a) Insufficient information to execute the request;  (b) In the case of a request for surrender, the fact that despite best efforts, the person sought cannot be  located or that the investigation conducted has determined that the person in the requested State is  clearly not the person named in the warrant; or  (c) The fact that execution of the request in its current form would require the requested State to breach  a pre-existing treaty obligation undertaken with respect to another State. Article 98   Cooperation with respect to waiver of immunity and consent to surrender 1. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender or assistance which would require the requested  State to act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the State or diplomatic  immunity of a person or property of a third State, unless the Court can first obtain the cooperation of that  third State for the waiver of the immunity.  2. The Court may not proceed with a request for surrender which would require the requested State to act  inconsistently with its obligations under international agreements pursuant to which the consent of a  sending State is required to surrender a person of that State to the Court, unless the Court can first obtain  the cooperation of the sending State for the giving of consent for the surrender.  Article 99   Execution of requests under articles 93 and 96 1. Requests for assistance shall be executed in accordance with the relevant procedure under the law of  the requested State and, unless prohibited by such law, in the manner specified in the request, including  following any procedure outlined therein or permitting persons specified in the request to be present at and  assist in the execution process.  2. In the case of an urgent request, the documents or evidence produced in response shall, at the request of  the Court, be sent urgently.  3. Replies from the requested State shall be transmitted in their original language and form.  4. Without prejudice to other articles in this Part, where it is necessary for the successful execution of a request  which can be executed without any compulsory measures, including specifically the interview of or taking  evidence from a person on a voluntary basis, including doing so without the presence of the authorities  of the requested State Party if it is essential for the request to be executed, and the examination without  modification of a public site or other public place, the Prosecutor may execute such request directly on the  territory of a State as follows:  (a) When the State Party requested is a State on the territory of which the crime is alleged to have been  committed, and there has been a determination of admissibility pursuant to article 18 or 19, the  Prosecutor may directly execute such request following all possible consultations with the requested  State Party;  (b) In other cases, the Prosecutor may execute such request following consultations with the requested  State Party and subject to any reasonable conditions or concerns raised by that State Party. Where  the requested State Party identifies problems with the execution of a request pursuant to this  subparagraph it shall, without delay, consult with the Court to resolve the matter. 5. Provisions allowing a person heard or examined by the Court under article 72 to invoke restrictions  designed to prevent disclosure of confidential information connected with national security shall also apply  to the execution of requests for assistance under this article. <br/>49 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtArticle 100   Costs 1.

Article 101   Rule of speciality 1. A person surrendered to the Court under this Statute shall not be proceeded against, punished or detained  for any conduct committed prior to surrender, other than the conduct or course of conduct which forms the  basis of the crimes for which that person has been surrendered.  2. The Court may request a waiver of the requirements of paragraph 1 from the State which surrendered the  person to the Court and, if necessary, the Court shall provide additional information in accordance with  article 91. States Parties shall have the authority to provide a waiver to the Court and should endeavour to  do so.

(c) A State designated in a particular case shall promptly inform the Court whether it accepts the Court's  designation.  2. (a) The State of enforcement shall notify the Court of any circumstances, including the exercise of  any conditions agreed under paragraph 1, which could materially affect the terms or extent of the  imprisonment. The Court shall be given at least 45 days' notice of any such known or foreseeable  circumstances. During this period, the State of enforcement shall take no action that might prejudice  its obligations under article 110.  (b) Where the Court cannot agree to the circumstances referred to in subparagraph (a), it shall notify the  State of enforcement and proceed in accordance with article 104, paragraph 1.  3. In exercising its discretion to make a designation under paragraph 1, the Court shall take into account the  following:  (a) The principle that States Parties should share the responsibility for enforcing sentences of  imprisonment, in accordance with principles of equitable distribution, as provided in the Rules of  Procedure and Evidence;  (b) The application of widely accepted international treaty standards governing the treatment of  prisoners;  (c) The views of the sentenced person;  (d) The nationality of the sentenced person;  (e) Such other factors regarding the circumstances of the crime or the person sentenced, or the effective  enforcement of the sentence, as may be appropriate in designating the State of enforcement.  4.

Subject to conditions which a State may have specified in accordance with article 103, paragraph 1 (b), the  sentence of imprisonment shall be binding on the States Parties, which shall in no case modify it.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any application for appeal and revision. The State of  enforcement shall not impede the making of any such application by a sentenced person. Article 106   Supervision of enforcement of sentences and conditions of imprisonment 1. The enforcement of a sentence of imprisonment shall be subject to the supervision of the Court and shall  be consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners. <br/>51 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court2. The conditions of imprisonment shall be governed by the law of the State of enforcement and shall be  consistent with widely accepted international treaty standards governing treatment of prisoners; in no  case shall such conditions be more or less favourable than those available to prisoners convicted of similar  offences in the State of enforcement.  3. Communications between a sentenced person and the Court shall be unimpeded and confidential. Article 107   Transfer of the person upon completion of sentence 1. Following completion of the sentence, a person who is not a national of the State of enforcement may, in  accordance with the law of the State of enforcement, be transferred to a State which is obliged to receive  him or her, or to another State which agrees to receive him or her, taking into account any wishes of the  person to be transferred to that State, unless the State of enforcement authorizes the person to remain in  its territory.  2. If no State bears the costs arising out of transferring the person to another State pursuant to paragraph 1,  such costs shall be borne by the Court.  3. Subject to the provisions of article 108, the State of enforcement may also, in accordance with its national  law, extradite or otherwise surrender the person to a State which has requested the extradition or surrender  of the person for purposes of trial or enforcement of a sentence.  Article 108   Limitation on the prosecution or punishment of other offences 1. A sentenced person in the custody of the State of enforcement shall not be subject to prosecution or  punishment or to extradition to a third State for any conduct engaged in prior to that person's delivery to  the State of enforcement, unless such prosecution, punishment or extradition has been approved by the  Court at the request of the State of enforcement.  2. The Court shall decide the matter after having heard the views of the sentenced person.  3. Paragraph 1 shall cease to apply if the sentenced person remains voluntarily for more than 30 days in the  territory of the State of enforcement after having served the full sentence imposed by the Court, or returns  to the territory of that State after having left it.  Article 109   Enforcement of fines and forfeiture measures 1. States Parties shall give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court under Part 7, without prejudice to  the rights of bona fide third parties, and in accordance with the procedure of their national law.  2. If a State Party is unable to give effect to an order for forfeiture, it shall take measures to recover the value  of the proceeds, property or assets ordered by the Court to be forfeited, without prejudice to the rights of  bona fide third parties.  3. Property, or the proceeds of the sale of real property or, where appropriate, the sale of other property, which  is obtained by a State Party as a result of its enforcement of a judgement of the Court shall be transferred  to the Court.  Article 110   Review by the Court concerning reduction of sentence 1. The State of enforcement shall not release the person before expiry of the sentence pronounced by the  Court.  2. The Court alone shall have the right to decide any reduction of sentence, and shall rule on the matter after  having heard the person.  3. When the person has served two thirds of the sentence, or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment, the  Court shall review the sentence to determine whether it should be reduced. Such a review shall not be  conducted before that time.  4. In its review under paragraph 3, the Court may reduce the sentence if it finds that one or more of the  following factors are present:  (a) The early and continuing willingness of the person to cooperate with the Court in its investigations  and prosecutions; <br/>52 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(b) The voluntary assistance of the person in enabling the enforcement of the judgements and orders of  the Court in other cases, and in particular providing assistance in locating assets subject to orders of  fine, forfeiture or reparation which may be used for the benefit of victims; or  (c) Other factors establishing a clear and significant change of circumstances sufficient to justify the  reduction of sentence, as provided in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence. 5. If the Court determines in its initial review under paragraph 3 that it is not appropriate to reduce the  sentence, it shall thereafter review the question of reduction of sentence at such intervals and applying such  criteria as provided for in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Article 111   Escape If a convicted person escapes from custody and flees the State of enforcement, that State may, after consultation  with the Court, request the person's surrender from the State in which the person is located pursuant to existing  bilateral or multilateral arrangements, or may request that the Court seek the person's surrender, in accordance  with Part 9. It may direct that the person be delivered to the State in which he or she was serving the sentence or  to another State designated by the Court. <br/>53 Rome Statute of the International Criminal CourtPART 11.

  Thousands of Greenlandic women were involuntarily implanted with IUDs to prevent them from becoming pregnant in the 1960s-1970s by the Danish colonial authorities. This was done to reduce population growth in Greenland – a cruel and cynical expression of population control as part of Danish imperialism’s colonial policy in Greenland.

  During the 1950s to 1960s, the birth rate in Greenland increased by 80%, with 1.781 children born per year in 1966. In 1966, the decision was made by the Ministry of Greenland and the Danish National Board of Health to implant IUDs in 4,500 of Greenland’s 9.000 estimated fertile women, that is 50%. Greenland’s population at the time was around 40.500. The so-called “IUD campaign” reached its peak intensity in the period between 1966 and the 1970s, when the procedures were performed without the consent of young women, some as young as 12 years old. Danish imperialism succeeded in slowing population growth through its cynical abuses, but in 1974 it was forced to abandon the policy. Not because it regretted its failures, but because its policy had succeeded and it feared a backlash in the form of rebellion and criticism of its policy from the UN – several of whose conventions had been violated throughout the process.

  The forced state contraception was carried out during a period when Greenland had formally ceased to be a Danish colony – but still is in practice today. At this time, however, Greenland was still subject to the Ministry of Greenland in the government, which oversaw the introduction of the coercive measures in the so-called IUD Campaign. The abuses were allegedly done so that population growth would not prevent the modernization of Greenland, in other words: not to get in the way of Danish imperialism’s desire to continue its dominance over Greenland. Many people in Greenland do not speak Danish, yet only Danish was spoken in the operating rooms and the doctors were Danes. Many of the girls were not informed that they were being sterilized, both because of the language barrier, but also because it was kept secret from them and their families.

<p>
  Greenland’s population growth has never recovered since the IUD Campaign and the population of Greenland has stagnated since the 1990s.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the policy was officially abandoned in 1974, it was unofficially continued for many years. In 1992, the local authorities in Greenland took over the health sector, where the policy continued with a further 14 Greenlandic women having IUDs implanted without consent.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  The abuse has caused permanent damage to many women today, who experience many discomforts such as pelvic inflammatory disease, severe pain, irregular bleeding and permanent tissue damage and sterilization. The IUDs used at the time were of the Lippes Loop type and were much larger than those used today, and were only intended for women who had already given birth before. For this reason, among others, the IUD has led to permanent trauma in many women’s abdomens after being in place for decades.
 </p>
<p>
  Involuntary contraception is not just a thing of the distant past either. In an interview with 4 Greenlandic women, the British media BBC has revealed how at least 4 cases of involuntary birth control have been known to have been carried out by the authorities in Greenland since the turn of the millennium. Information has also
  <a href="">
   reported
  </a>
  on at least three involuntary induced abortions performed by the authorities in 2004, 2010 and 2013.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, 143 Greenlandic women are suing the Danish state, seeking compensation of 300.000 DKK [Note by translator: around 44.000 USD] each for their suffering. This case is currently receiving a lot of media attention. The bourgeois Danish state and the authorities in Greenland are currently using the case as part of a “historical investigation of the Danish-Greenlandic history”, 45 million DKK [Note by translator: around 6,5 million USD] has been allocated by the state for this purpose. This investigation is part of the ongoing process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands to go from colonies to semi-colonies. Danish imperialism therefore needs to admit many of its crimes and come clean about them in order to continue its exploitation of Greenland and its strategic position in the Arctic.
 </p>
<p>
  The transition from colony to semi-colony for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should be understood as a deliberate act of Danish imperialism. It is a way for it to refine its exploitation of the countries, as this is more stable than the official colonial form. At the same time, it is an expression of the fact that revolution is the main trend in the world today, it is a sign of the decay of imperialism and the collapse of the last remnants of the colonial system in the world. Danish imperialism has learned the lessons of the people’s anti-colonial struggles in mainly Africa and Asia and has chosen to stay ahead of them by dictating the process itself. The inter-imperialist contradictions must also be taken into account, with mainly Yankee imperialism taking a renewed interest in the Arctic in its struggle against Russian imperialism. At the same time, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has now attracted the attention of other imperialists who want to develop mining in Greenland.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full">
<img alt="" class="wp-image-10198" decoding="async" height="759" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src="https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SpiralCampaign_5.webp" srcset="https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SpiralCampaign_5.webp" width="900"/>
</figure>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The process for Greenland and the Faroe Islands should therefore be understood as a sign of weakness for Danish imperialism and imperialism in general, which is no longer able to maintain colonies, and that the masses in Greenland and the Faroe Islands defiantly continue to combat and resist.

  network of spy satellites called ”Starshield” under a classified contract with the US government. SpaceX has a $1.8 billion contract with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which includes personnel from the CIA and the Space Forces, to build a network of satellites able to quickly single out military targets almost anywhere in the world to support the ground forces of US imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  “The National Reconnaissance Office is developing the most capable, diverse, and resilient space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance system the world has ever seen,” a spokesperson for the NRO described the system. According to sources close to the project, the system would be so extensive that ”no one could hide”. The spy system would consist of low-orbiting satellites able to provide the US military with detailed images of the Earth, and it would also be

   more immun
  </a>
  e to disruptions, which the US says especially Russian imperialism would attempt to cause to its satellites. This system would provide information faster and near-constantly compared to old-type of higher-orbiting satellites.
 </p>
<p>
  Chinese social-imperialism has its own aspirations regarding the militarization of space, and its own spy satellite network program, and it immediately
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/world/china-s-military-state-media-slam-u-s-after-reuters-report-on-spacex-spy-satellites/ar-BB1k54mu">
   expressed
  </a>
  its concern over ”Starshield” and accused the US of escalating tensions and threatening “global security”. Russian imperialism
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/russia-warns-united-states-use-of-spacex-for-spying-makes-its-satellites-a-target/ar-BB1kdw8l">
   warned
  </a>
  the US that through using commercial satellites for military purposes, these satellites become legitimate military targets.
 </p>
<p>
  In one hand, as is highlighted in the mainstream media, Starshield reflects the US asserting its position as the sole hegemonic superpower over Russian imperialism, as well as Chinese social-imperialism, with a massive militarization of space, using the most advanced new technologies. In the other hand, and mainly, corresponding to the main contradiction in the world today, it is spearheaded against the oppressed nations, in order to increase repression against their struggle for liberation, “so that no one can hide” from the all-seeing eye of Yankee imperialism. Here it is necessary to note however that even though imperialists highlight how advanced, how “omnipotent” this technology is, faced with the peoples of the world it is only a paper tiger.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2021, the US Department of Defense (DoD) officials
  <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2629675/space-based-capabilities-critical-to-us-national-security-dod-officials-say/">
   said
  </a>
  that space-based capabilities are critical for the US and that the US has to be prepared to conflicts which extent to space or even originate there, not meaning that war would be waged in space but that space would play a role in armed conflicts on Earth. In this context, DoD described as the main threat the space aspirations of Russian imperialism and Chinese social-imperialism: “Russia and China view space as critical to modern warfare and consider the use of counterspace capabilities as both a means of reducing U.S. military effectiveness and winning future wars”, DoD principal director for space policy said.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX is the largest operator of satellites in the world. The first SpaceX satellite was developed under a contract with the US, and its Falcon 9 rockets have been used to transport US military payloads to space. Already before Starshield SpaceX had aspirations to sell its Starlink technology to the US Department of Defense, but what the US imperialism wanted was technology specifically engineered to meet its needs.
 </p>
<p>
  SpaceX has already around 5,500 commercial Starlink satellites orbiting the Earth. These provide internet for different actors, and it is used among others by the Ukrainian military for communications. SpaceX sent 22,000 Starlink terminals to Ukraine in the first year since the beginning of the war of aggression, and they have played a “significant role”
  <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/10/europe/ukraine-starlink-not-active-crimea-intl-hnk/index.html">
   according
  </a>
  to Ukrainian military sources. This was the first major conflict where such commercial space technology has been used for military purposes in a significant way and some US experts describe that such integration of commercial space technology for military operations is the “way of the future”. The space played already a role in for example the Gulf war, and satellites are commonly used in warfare and intelligence all over the world, but with the war of aggression against Ukraine the use of a commercial service is noteworthy. According to the CEO of SpaceX Elon Musk, who likes to pretend he is a “scientist” working for the good of the human kind, claims that the terminals were provided to Ukraine for “humanitarian” purposes and not military purposes. In 2023 it was also claimed that Musk ordered some connections to be shut down near Crimea to sabotage a Ukrainian attack against Russian warships because he was afraid of Russia reacting with nuclear weapons. In 2024, the Ukrainian military
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/house-democrats-probe-spacex-over-alleged-illegal-export-and-use-of-starlink-by-russia/ar-BB1jvI9P">
   said
  </a>
  it has evidence Starlink has been used also by Russia. The war of aggression in Ukraine has therefore in one hand served to refine the technology for military purposes, and in the other it has shown the capabilities of such technology and the “necessity” of the increasing militarization of space for the imperialists. Therefore it has raised the interest of US imperialism to ensure such technology serves its interests only and can be used extensively for this – and to this the Starshield system answers.
 </p>
<p>
  It is
  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/airpower-after-ukraine/commercial-satellites-are-on-the-front-lines-of-war-today-heres-what-this-means-for-the-future-of-warfare/">
   claimed
  </a>
  that as the costs of launching satellites and rockets to space lower and more and more commercial companies pop up, it “democratizes” the space. This is of course a similar machination as the free competition and “the American dream” under capitalism, that today has reached the stage of imperialism, and the tendency of monopolization and struggle for hegemony is seen also in space and this commercialization of space is used by the imperialists to achieve their interests. It is openly stated by US experts that using commercial technologies for military purposes is the future, and companies are put to develop military technologies in close contact with the US government. Trae Stephens, a principal at Founders Fund, whose investments include SpaceX, said in 2023 that the war of aggression has woken up members of the financial oligarchy to see the potential in military technologies instead of civilian infrastructure. This means deeper militarization of society.
 </p>
<p>
  As the general crisis of imperialism develops further and further, it becomes more and more urgent for the imperialists to develop all-encompassing militarization, that even reaches space. Technological advancement is put to serve destruction and the maintaining of oppression, the hegemony of the US imperialism in the world. This is a sign of weakness, and as has been seen multiple times, despite its technological overpower, it has experienced and keeps on experiencing devastating blows from the peoples of the world.

<p>
  18. maaliskuuta, noin 100 LCP:n järjestämää maatilojen valloittajaa Jaqueirassa, Pernambucossa (PE) sijaitsevista yhteisöistä (Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabugi, Monteir, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa D’agua, Tenório ja Sítio Grande) yhdistivät voimansa palauttaakseen vesilähteensä, joita piiritti suurtilallisyritys Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A, jonka omistaa tilanherra Guilherme Maranhão.
 </p>
<p>
  Vuodesta 2015, kun maiden ja vesilähteiden ryöstö alkoi, talonpojat ovat eläneet ja tuottaneet entisen Frei Caneca -tilan mailla. Tilanherra Guilherme Maranhãp, jota tukee entinen kuvernööri Paulo Camara, asetti pyssymiesryhmiä jotka uhkailevat koko väestöä laajentaakseen nautakarjankasvatusta kansainväliseen vientiin Masterboin teurastamon kautta.
 </p>
<p>
  Huolimatta kattavasta todistusaineistosta veden myrkytyksestä tilanherrojen päästämillä tuholaismyrkyillä (karjan paskalla ja kusella saastuttamisen lisäksi), Pernambucon Julkinen Ministeriö (MPPE) ja Pernambucon ympäristöasioiden osavaltiosihteeristö (CPRH) eivät koskaan aloittaneet mitään rikostutkintaa suurtilallisyritys Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A:a vastaan.
 </p>
<p>
  Näin ollen talonpojat päättivät Kansankokouksessa toimeenpanna suuren aktion vesilähteiden ottamiseksi takaisin suurtilalta. Kutsu saavutti koko paikallisen väestön lentolehtisillä toreilla ja kaikissa tämän ympäristörikoksen ja kansan terveyden vastaisen rikoksen koskettamissa talonpoikaisyhteisöissä. Talonpojat järjestivät myös yhteisponnistuksia vesilähteiden puhdistamiseksi ja eristämiseksi, 50 metrin päässä suurtilanherran karjatiloista ja eucalyptusplantaaseista.

  Kaiken tämän työn suorittamiseksi tilanvaltaajat laskivat José Ricardon Vallankumouksellisen Alueen talonpoikien ja Mangue Vermelho -Liikkeen nuorten opiskelijoiden tukeen. He auttoivat raivaamaan puskat ja merkitsemään aidat vesilähteiden suojelemiseksi paahtavassa auringossa. Enemmänkin, he kohtasivat muun kansan rinnalla taistellen tilanherrojen provokaatiot.

  Heti kun talonpojat olivat suurella taisteluhengellä saaneet yhteisponnistuksensa päätökseen päivän ensimmäisellä vesilähteellä, laulaen kansanlauluja ja huutaen iskulauseita, puolitusinaa pyssymiestä suurtiloilta ilmestyi traktoreineen, lavafarmareineen, moottoripyörineen ja mönkijöineen. Pyssymiehet saapuivat tolppien, langan ja eukalyptussiementen kanssa laittamaan niitä samalle alueelle, jonka talonpojat olivat juuri raivanneet. Kun talonpoikaismarssi kohtasi bandiitit, tilanherrojen edustajat alkoivat uhkailla talonpoikia tuliaseilla. Jännite johti yhteenottoon, kolme pyssymiestä loukkaantui ja suurtilan drooni tuhottiin tuliaseista raivostuneiden kansanjoukkojen toimesta.
 </p>
<p>
  Tänä samana maaliskuuna 18:a MPPE:n maatalouspromoottori, CPRH:n agentit, edusajat Osavaltion Komiteasta Agraarikonfliktien Valvomiseksi (CEACA), edustajat Laidunmaiden Komissiosta (CPT) ja Pernambucon Työläisten ja Talonpoikien Federaatiosta (FETAPE), pormestari Ridete Pellegrino ja kunnanvaltuutetut Jaqueirasta, sekä lakimiehet suurtilallisyritys Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A:sta vierailivat tutkiakseen tilanherran tekemiä valituksia talonpojista. Tämän tiedon mukaan tämä komissio ei vieraillut talonpoikien vesilähteillä, vaan ainoastaan tilanherrojen osoittamissa paikoissa.
 </p>
<p>
  Kuitenkin, talonpoikien voimallinen aktio pakotti koko komission esittäytymään aktion tapahtumapaikalla ja hyväksymään kaksi lakimiestä Kansanasianajajien brasilialaisesta yhdistyksestä (Abrapo) sekä Barro Brancon Tilanvaltaajien Yhdistyksen puheenjohtajan komissioon ja tämän lisäksi joutui hyväksymään yleisössä olleen kansan kiireelliset ehdot.
 </p>
<p>
  Lopulta MPPE hyväksyi Abrapon edustamien talonpoikien ehdotuksen luoda “vesikäytävä” kansan vesilähteiden erottamiseksi. Tilanherra määrättiin maksamaan tolpat ja lanka, kaupunginhallinto lähettää työntekijät ja Osavaltion ympäristöosaston vastuulle tuli kansan vesien tutkiminen saastumisen määrittelyksi ja rikostutkinnan avaamiseksi tilanherraa vastaan.
 </p>
<p>
  Oikeuden kuulemisen jälkeen Guilherme Maranhãon pyssymiehet pyysivät vahvistuksia Pernambucon sotilaspoliisilta (PM-PE) eucalyptuksen istuttamiseksi yhdelle vesilähteistä, jonka talonpojat olivat siivonneet yhteistoimin, ja tilanherrojen lakimies Eduardo Figueredo julisti että he tulisivat suorittaamaan sotilaallisen aktion talonpoikaisperheiden karkottamiseksi metsiä lähellä sijaitsevilta alueilta.
 </p>
<p>
  Kaksi ajoneuvoa lähetettiin tuomaan turvaa pyssymiehille jatkaakseen kansanvastaisia toimiaan. Tämä ei ole rohkeutta osoittava teko, vaan pikemminkin pelkuruutta osoittava teko agraarivallankumouksen yhdistämien ja järjestämien talonpoikien pienen voimannäytön edessä. Se myös osoittaa, kuinka omistautuneita tämän vanhan valtion sotilasvoimat ovat tilanherrojen etujen suojelemiselle ja onnettumuuksien edistämiseksi köyhälle väestölle maalla ja kaupungissa.
 </p>
<p>
  Entisen Frei Canecan tilaa miehittävät talonpojat ovat päättäväisinä ottamaan takaisin kaikki vesilähteensä ja maansa tilanherran käsistä. Tällä tavoin he kutsuvat kaikkia talonpoikia Pernambucon eteläisellä metsäalueella nousemaan suurtilayritysten pyssymiesryhmiä ja tämän vanhan valtion asevoimia vastaan. Tuhoamatta suurtiloja ei voida koskaan saada oikeutta maaseudun köyhälle kansalle.

  No dia 19 de março, a comunidade camponesa São Benedito, no município de São Bernardo, no Maranhão, denunciou em sua rede social atividades criminosas de grileiros que ameaçam a vida da população local. No vídeo, uma criança de dez anos relata as tentativas de invasão e roubo de terra, mas que os camponeses “não vão deixar”. Ela também mostra a intensa produção camponesa no local.
 </p>
<p>
  A comunidade tem mais de 200 anos de existência, com terras passadas de geração para geração, na qual os moradores trabalham na roça para sua subsistência. De acordo com o que foi documentado pelos mesmos,

  , casas estão sendo demolidas, terras griladas estão sendo desmatadas sem a autorização do IBAMA e suas plantações também estão comprometidas por ações criminosas do latifúndio.

  Situações semelhantes têm crescido por todo estado do Maranhão, principalmente após a implementação da “Lei da Grilagem”, sancionada pelo governador Carlos Brandão. Sendo uma versão atualizada da conhecida Lei Sarney de Terras, a legislação que amplia a possibilidade de regularização de terras públicas de 200 para 2,5 mil hectares, servindo de instrumento para que latifundiários, em nome do agronegócio, sintam-se no direito de cometer hediondos atos de violência contra o povo camponês, indígenas e quilombolas.

   Come già abbiamo denunciato (*), il regime egiziano di Al Sisi sta facendo costruire un recinto nel deserto del Sinai per rinchiudervi i palestinesi in fuga da Gaza, e facilitare così la “pulizia etnica” da parte di Israele, in cambio di finanziamenti del Fmi.
  </p>
<p>
   Il regime egiziano è dominato dai militari, che sono anche tra i maggiori capitalisti del paese. Lanciatisi in affari “faraonici”, come la costruzione della nuova capitale (con enormi profitti per sé e per gli amici), hanno ingigantito anche il debito dello stato e ora il solo pagamento degli interessi sul debito pesa per oltre il 10% del Pil. Soluzione: stampare moneta, quindi creare inflazione, ossia tagliare il potere d’acquisto dei salari per mantenere i profitti dei padroni, privati, di stato e militari.
   <br>
   A settembre 2023 l’inflazione aveva raggiunto il 40%, ossia il potere d’acquisto dei già miseri salari e stipendi aveva subito un taglio del 40%.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Temendo il malcontento per i salari di fame anche tra i dipendenti pubblici, il governo ha decretato l’aumento del salario minimo da 4.000 a 6.000 sterline egiziane (al cambio corrente, oggi 120 euro al mese). Per i dipendenti privati, però, il salario minimo è stato portato a sole LE 3.500.
   <br>
   A gennaio, ai lavoratori che protestavano per i bassi salari, al Sisi aveva avuto la spudoratezza di rispondere: “Non mangiamo? Mangiamo. Non beviamo? Beviamo, e tutto funziona [e qui aveva fatto un osceno, irridente, paragone con la condizione dei palestinesi deliberatamente affamati e assetati dallo stato sionista – ndr.]. Le cose sono costose e alcune non sono disponibili? E allora?”.

<b>
   Mahalla al-Kubra nel Delta del Nilo, che ha più di un secolo di storia e di lotte, è arrivata il 22 febbraio.
  </b>
<b>
   Scandendo slogan di protesta sono scese in sciopero in 3.700.
  </b>
  Nonostante l’intervento delle guardie per impedire loro di accedere al piazzale centrale, e la scesa in campo del sindacato ufficiale contro lo sciopero, lo sciopero, sostenuto da un sindacato indipendente, si è esteso ad almeno 7 mila lavoratori.
  <br/>
  La risposta dei padroni e del governo è stata: bastone e carota. Salario minimo a 6.000 LE (un aumento del 70%), arresto di 13 “leader” dello sciopero (fonte: LabourStart), di cui due ancora detenuti alla data del 13 marzo, sono anche minacciati di licenziamento per assenza ingiustificata.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   Evidentemente padroni e governo contano sulla prosecuzione dell’inflazione (ancora al 31% a gennaio 2024), che rimangerà gli aumenti, e gli arresti sono un avvertimento a chiunque, a Mahalla o altrove, venisse in mente di tornare alla lotta.
   <br/>
   Ma lasciar proseguire lo sciopero senza concessioni è sembrato troppo pericoloso al governo: avrebbe rischiato un’esplosione generalizzata perché sa che il forte aumento del costo della vita ha aumentato la pressione tra i lavoratori.
   <br/>
   Un’esplosione che potrebbe collegarsi al sostegno popolare alla causa palestinese che in Egitto c’è, per quanto il regime militare faccia tutto quel che può per non farlo manifestare, e al più generale malcontento per le pesantissime condizioni di lavoro e di vita di milioni di proletari.
  </p>
<p>
   Negli stessi giorni, infatti, sono scesi in lotta anche centinaia di lavoratori di una grande impresa di costruzioni di proprietà del miliardario Talaat Moustafa, in società con la famiglia saudita dei Bin Laden.
  </p>
  Hanno protestato contro il licenziamento dei lavoratori a tempo indeterminato (soprattutto quelli che hanno subito incidenti sul lavoro o si sono ammalati) per assumere lavoratori con contratti precari, e chiedendo il pagamento di arretrati, un aumento salariale per il carovita, misure di sicurezza e dispositivi di protezione sui cantieri, una maggiore copertura sanitaria.
  <p>
</p>
<p>
   In questo caso è significativo che le guardie aziendali, che una settimana prima erano intervenute a reprimere una protesta degli impiegati, qualche giorno dopo hanno a loro volta rifiutato di entrare in servizio, lamentando il fatto di essere pagati LE 3000 (60 euro) al mese per 14 ore di lavoro al giorno, e hanno ottenuto un aumento.
  </p>
<p>
   Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa, divenuto un colosso con le commesse per la nuova capitale, sta ora partecipando in società con il gruppo Adq degli Emirati a un progetto da 35 miliardi di dollari per la costruzione di una città turistica sul litorale mediterraneo, su terreni privatizzati dai militari.
  </p>
<p>
   Questi episodi di lotte operaie sono indicativi di una temperatura sociale che sta salendo in Egitto come in altri paesi del Medio Oriente e che potrebbe portare a nuove esplosioni se la crisi economica si aggraverà, in collegamento anche con la rabbia provocata dalla guerra genocidaria di Israele contro la popolazione di Gaza.
   <br/>
   Non a caso il Fmi offre ad al-Sisi miliardi in cambio del lavoro sporco di collaborazione con Israele; mentre da parte loro Meloni e von del Leyen promettono 7,4 miliardi di euro all’Egitto perché faccia il lavoro altrettanto sporco di trattenere gli emigranti verso l’Europa, oltre che per altri lucrosi affari.
  </p>
<p>
   Ci permettiamo di ripeterlo: gli unici veri amici dei palestinesi aggrediti e oppressi da Israele a Gaza e in Cisgiordania sono i lavoratori e gli sfruttati della regione e del mondo, non i governi capitalisti arabi che sfruttano e reprimono i propri lavoratori e sono pronti a fare affari collaborando con le metropoli imperialiste nella repressione di palestinesi e migranti.

    MIGLIAIA DI LAVORATORI SCIOPERANO PER L’AUMENTO DEI SALARI NELLA FABBRICA DI GHAZL AL-MAHALLA
   </b>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
   – di Beesan Kassab, 25 febbraio 2024
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori di Ghazl al-Mahalla sono in sciopero per ottenere salari più alti e bonus più equi.
  </p>
<p>
   Circa 7.000 lavoratori si sono riuniti sabato mattina nella piazza centrale del complesso industriale di Ghazl al-Mahalla per uno sciopero che dura già da tre giorni.
  </p>
<p>
   Chiedono che il loro pasto giornaliero venga aumentato a 30 LE [=0,57 euro], alzando un coro in cui si dice che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
  </p>
<p>
   Chiedono anche l’applicazione di salari più alti, facendo riferimento a un recente aumento salariale per il settore pubblico basato su istruzioni del presidente Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in mezzo a un’ondata inflazionistica che ha fatto salire il costo della vita a livello nazionale. In altri slogan, i lavoratori hanno chiesto: “Dov’è la decisione di Sisi?”.
  </p>
<p>
   La mega-fabbrica di proprietà pubblica impiega decine di migliaia di persone nei settori della filatura, del tessile e del cotone medicale, oltre a una centrale elettrica su un’enorme area di terreno a Mahalla al-Kubra, nel governatorato di Gharbiya.
  </p>
<p>
   Fino a domenica, le trattative dei lavoratori con la società madre sono fallite, ha dichiarato il Centro per i sindacati e i servizi ai lavoratori in un comunicato diffuso sabato sera. All’incontro hanno partecipato un rappresentante della presidenza, dell’Ufficio del Lavoro, del Ministero del Commercio e dell’Industria e il presidente del Sindacato Generale della Filatura e Tessitura.
  </p>
<p>
   Diversi uomini che lavorano nell’azienda sono stati trattenuti sabato dall’Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza dopo essere stati convocati per essere interrogati dall’organismo di sicurezza insieme ad alcune lavoratrici, ha dichiarato la CTUWS, senza specificare il numero dei detenuti.
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori hanno lanciato lo sciopero giovedì [22 febbraio], hanno dichiarato a Mada Masr, iniziando nelle fabbriche di abbigliamento a prevalenza femminile, che storicamente sono state in prima linea in diversi scioperi famosi dell’azienda.
  </p>
<p>
   Hanan*, supervisore di una fabbrica di abbigliamento, ha raccontato a Mada Masr che gli operai del suo edificio hanno iniziato a scandire slogan, interrompendo infine il lavoro mentre i canti si diffondevano da una fabbrica all’altra.
  </p>
<p>
   Contemporaneamente, il personale di sicurezza ha sigillato le uscite per evitare che le donne si riversassero nella piazza centrale del complesso, nota come piazza Talaat Harb. Questa misura di sicurezza è stata applicata anche alla centrale elettrica, secondo Abdullah* che lavora lì.
  </p>
<p>
   Il personale di sicurezza ha sbloccato i cancelli della fabbrica intorno alle 15.00 di giovedì, mezz’ora prima della fine del turno mattutino, per assicurarsi che i lavoratori uscissero dai locali e non si riunissero all’interno, ha detto Hanan.
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori dell’azienda hanno descritto i bassi salari come causa di insoddisfazione.
  </p>
<p>
   Il costo della vita è aumentato in tutto il Paese, con un’inflazione che supererà il 30% nel 2024. Un recente “pacchetto presidenziale”, che sarà varato a partire da marzo, prevede un aumento del salario minimo per il settore pubblico da 4.000 a 6.000 LE al mese, con incrementi che vanno da 1.000 a 1.200 LE per le diverse categorie lavorative.
  </p>
<p>
   Sebbene sia di proprietà dello Stato, la Misr Spinning and Weaving Company, che possiede Ghazl al-Mahalla, non rientra nell’ambito del pacchetto presidenziale, ha dichiarato a Mada Masr una fonte del Ministero delle Finanze.
  </p>
<p>
   I salari dell’azienda sono invece guidati dalle decisioni del Consiglio nazionale per i salari, che lo scorso ottobre ha innalzato il salario minimo del settore privato a 3.500 LE.
  </p>
<p>
   Ma l’aumento di ottobre non è servito a contrastare la riduzione del potere d’acquisto causata dall’inflazione. Dopo più di 25 anni di servizio, Abdel Aziz* ha dichiarato a Mada Masr che il suo guadagno totale non supera i 4.000 LE al mese. La cifra equivale a circa 130 dollari al tasso di cambio ufficiale, o a circa 80 dollari al tasso del mercato parallelo al momento in cui scriviamo.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdullah ha dichiarato che il suo stipendio è di 4.200 LEE dopo 33 anni di lavoro con l’azienda. Hanan, che si sta avvicinando alla pensione, riceve uno stipendio di circa 6.200 LE.
  </p>
<p>
   Diverse fonti di lavoro dell’azienda hanno raccontato che giorni prima dello sciopero, il governatore di Gharbiya aveva effettuato una serie di visite per ispezionare un convoglio che fornisce beni sovvenzionati ai lavoratori dell’azienda.
  </p>
<p>
   Abdel Aziz ha aggiunto che durante la visita di mercoledì, il governatore ha ispezionato un convoglio medico che rifornisce i lavoratori e “un lavoratore ha detto al governatore che il suo stipendio non supera i 3500 LE”.
  </p>
<p>
   Secondo una dichiarazione della CTUWS pubblicata sabato, i lavoratori chiedono ora che il salario minimo sia portato a 6.000 LE, con aumenti salariali in base all’anzianità di servizio e una riduzione degli stanziamenti fiscali.
  </p>
<p>
   Chiedono inoltre che la loro indennità giornaliera per i pasti sia aumentata a 30 LE, per un totale di 900 LE al mese invece degli attuali 210 LE al mese, con un canto che circolava durante lo sciopero in cui si affermava che l’importo copre a malapena “il prezzo di un litro di latte”.
  </p>
<p>
   La dichiarazione del CTUWS di sabato [24 febbraio] ha sottolineato che i membri del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda, affiliato alla Federazione sindacale egiziana allineata allo Stato, hanno cercato di dissuadere i lavoratori dallo sciopero e di intimidirli, ma sono stati espulsi dalla piazza.
  </p>
<p>
   Una figura di spicco del comitato sindacale ufficiale dell’azienda ha dichiarato giovedì a Mada Masr, a condizione di anonimato, che il comitato “preferisce la negoziazione allo sciopero, ma sostiene le richieste dei lavoratori”.
  </p>
<p>
   Ghazl al-Mahalla ha agito da catalizzatore alla fine del 2006 per una rinascita dell’azione sindacale a livello nazionale, quando uno sciopero di decine di migliaia di lavoratori della fabbrica si è riverberato in un movimento di scioperi simili in altre fabbriche del Paese.

   Ginevra – 6 marzo 2024
  </p>
<p>
   In uno sviluppo preoccupante, la Sicurezza Nazionale di Gharbia, in Egitto, avrebbe trattenuto almeno cinque dipendenti della rinomata azienda tessile Ghazl El-Mahalla, nonostante la decisione dei lavoratori di disperdere il loro sciopero del 29 febbraio 2024.
   <br/>
   I dipendenti hanno iniziato lo sciopero per chiedere l’applicazione del salario minimo.
  </p>
<p>
   Tra i detenuti ci sono Wael Abu Zuwayed e Mohamed Mahmoud Tolba, attualmente trattenuti presso la sede della Sicurezza Nazionale a Tanta. Essi si aggiungono ad altri tre lavoratori, Sabah Ali al-Qattan, Muhammad al-Attar e Abdel Hamid Abu Amna, anch’essi detenuti.
  </p>
<p>
   Wael Abu Zuwayed è stato portato davanti alla Procura della Sicurezza di Stato del Cairo, dove è stato deciso di trattenerlo in custodia cautelare per 15 giorni. È accusato di aver aderito a un gruppo formato in violazione della legge e di aver diffuso false informazioni.
  </p>
<p>
   Con una mossa controversa, il 4 marzo la direzione di Ghazl El Mahalla ha emesso avvisi di licenziamento per i lavoratori detenuti, Wael Muhammad Abu Zuwayed e Muhammad Mahmoud Tolba. L’azienda sostiene che la loro assenza dal lavoro è durata dieci giorni, ignorando opportunamente che è avvenuta in seguito alla loro detenzione da parte della Sicurezza Nazionale.
  </p>
<p>
   Il Comitato per la giustizia (CFJ) ha condannato le detenzioni, affermando che lo sciopero è una reazione “spontanea” alle difficoltà economiche dell’Egitto e alla confusione della politica finanziaria. Il CFJ sottolinea la necessità di un dialogo costruttivo e di soluzioni realistiche per affrontare le legittime richieste dei lavoratori, invece di ricorrere alla repressione e all’intimidazione. […]

    LE NUOVE AZIONI DEI LAVORATORI OFFRONO UNA SPERANZA DI CAMBIAMENTO IN EGITTO

<p>
   Oltre a subire le pressioni delle masse per la vile risposta del regime egiziano agli spietati attacchi dello Stato israeliano a Gaza, il presidente “uomo forte” Sisi deve affrontare la crescente rabbia dei lavoratori. L’aumento vertiginoso dei prezzi dei generi alimentari ha colpito duramente i lavoratori egiziani a basso salario, ma ci sono segnali di una ripresa della lotta.
  </p>
<p>
   Circa 14.000 lavoratori tessili della più grande fabbrica egiziana, la Misr Spin-ning and Weaving Company, a Mahalla al-Kubra, nella regione del Delta del Nilo, hanno iniziato una settimana di sciopero il 22 febbraio. I lavoratori di una delle maggiori filiali della società immobiliare Talaat Moustafa Group, la Alexan-dria Construction, al Cairo, hanno protestato il 28 febbraio.
  </p>
<p>
   Sono state le lavoratrici della fabbrica di abbigliamento Mahalla a iniziare a scandire slogan che si sono rapidamente diffusi da un edificio all’altro. Il personale di sicurezza ha bloccato le uscite per impedire che questi lavoratori, così come quelli della centrale elettrica in loco, si riunissero nella piazza centrale. Tuttavia, il terzo giorno, 7.000 scioperanti si sono radunati lì. Decine di persone sono state arrestate. Come di consueto, il comitato sindacale ufficiale gestito dallo Stato ha denunciato lo sciopero, ma i lavoratori li hanno cacciati dalla manifestazione.
  </p>
<p>
   Questo evento riecheggia lo storico sciopero del 2006, quando le donne di Mahalla iniziarono lo sciopero che fu un passo fondamentale verso la rivolta del 2011 che mise fine ai 31 anni di governo del presidente Hosni Mubarak. Nel 2008, la città ha assistito a una rivolta che si sarebbe ripetuta su scala nazionale tre anni dopo.
  </p>
<p>
   […] Lo sciopero è terminato dopo una settimana, in seguito all’intervento del Ministro del settore pubblico. La direzione ha accettato di pagare un minimo di 6.000 LE al mese e la maggior parte dei lavoratori arrestati è stata rilasciata. Un’offerta precedente, che includeva il pagamento degli straordinari, la partecipazione agli utili e l’assicurazione sanitaria, non è stata accettata.
  </p>
<p>
   Protesta dei lavoratori edili
  </p>
<p>
   Centinaia di lavoratori della Talaat Moustafa hanno protestato davanti alla sede dell’azienda. L’azienda ha licenziato lavoratori con contratti a tempo indeterminato e li ha sostituiti con lavoratori temporanei a condizioni peggiori. I lavoratori hanno chiesto pagamenti arretrati, un bonus per il costo della vita, una migliore assicurazione sanitaria e dispositivi di sicurezza nei cantieri.
  </p>
<p>
   Le condizioni dei cantieri sono pessime, non sono disponibili dispositivi di sicurezza e la copertura sanitaria è insufficiente. Molti lavoratori licenziati sono stati feriti sul lavoro o soffrono di malattie croniche.
  </p>
<p>
   I lavoratori hanno riferito ai giornalisti che i criteri per i bonus e gli aumenti sono oscuri, ma vengono costantemente erogati a persone imparentate o collegate ai dirigenti. I dirigenti e i loro assistenti ricevono benefici sontuosi, mentre le retribuzioni dei lavoratori rimangono basse.
  </p>
<p>
   Insolitamente, la polizia non ha tentato di bloccare la protesta, anche se in passato ha fermato proteste più piccole. Tuttavia, il 4 marzo una protesta dei lavoratori degli uffici è stata impedita quando le forze di sicurezza hanno bloccato i cancelli.
  </p>
<p>
   Ma poi centinaia di guardie di sicurezza dell’azienda si sono rifiutate di iniziare il loro turno! Hanno chiesto salari più alti, migliori benefit, orari di lavoro e ferie. “I nostri stipendi sono molto bassi, pari a 3.000 LE. Lavoriamo per oltre 14 ore al giorno, a differenza del resto dei dipendenti. Riceviamo il bonus trimestrale a una percentuale inferiore rispetto a loro”, ha spiegato una guardia.
  </p>
<p>
   Nel giro di 30 minuti, un alto dirigente li ha incontrati, promettendo di pagare un aumento entro due mesi, dopodiché la protesta è terminata.
  </p>
<p>
   Il regime di Mubarak rimane
  </p>
<p>
   Il gruppo Talaat Moustafa ha avuto enormi contratti per la costruzione della nuova capitale che il presidente Sisi ha supervisionato. Nell’ultimo anno ha triplicato le sue attività nel settore immobiliare e dell’ospitalità, nonostante la crisi economica dell’Egitto. Negli ultimi mesi il prezzo delle sue azioni è salito, facendo guadagnare milioni di dollari al suo multimilionario azionista principale, Talaat Moustafa. Uno degli uomini più ricchi dell’Africa, era vicino al figlio di Hosni Mubarak, Gamal, odiato dai lavoratori per aver spinto una vasta privatizzazione quando il padre era presidente.
  </p>
<p>
   Nel 2008, Talaat Moustafa è stato riconosciuto colpevole di aver pagato 2 milioni di dollari a un ex poliziotto per uccidere la cantante libanese Suzanne Tamim. Gli altri principali azionisti del Gruppo Talaat Moustafa sono la famiglia Bin Laden dell’Arabia Saudita.
  </p>
<p>
   A febbraio, la società ha concluso un accordo di partnership con la società di investimenti degli Emirati Arabi Uniti ADQ per la costruzione di una nuova e vasta città turistica a Ras el-Hikma, sulla costa mediterranea, a ovest di Alessandria. L’operazione da 35 miliardi di dollari, compresa la vendita di terreni da parte dell’esercito, aiuterà notevolmente il governo di Sisi a pagare i 42 miliardi di dollari di debiti e gli interessi che dovrà pagare quest’anno. Molti sono gli interrogativi sollevati, tra cui la fattibilità del progetto, il suo costo ambientale, il vero valore del terreno, come si sia arrivati alla proprietà dell’esercito, quale sia l’opinione dei residenti locali (che non sono stati consultati) e quali controlli ci saranno sui futuri profitti in una “zona economica libera”.
  </p>
<p>
   Il disperato bisogno di valuta estera del governo Sisi lo ha costretto a vendere beni di proprietà dello Stato. Ras el-Hikma si aggiunge alla lista crescente di aziende e terreni egiziani ora sotto la proprietà e il controllo del Golfo.
  </p>
<p>
   Le gravi disuguaglianze, la corruzione e la brutale repressione dell’opposizione del regime dell’ex presidente Hosni Mubarak sono continuate, e persino aumentate, sotto Sisi. I recenti scioperi e le proteste dei lavoratori potrebbero segnare l’inizio di una nuova ondata di azioni della classe operaia, come quella sviluppatasi negli ultimi anni di Mubarak.
  </p>
<p>
   Il risveglio della classe operaia egiziana potrebbe essere un potente fattore per porre fine alla crisi di Gaza, aprire il valico di Rafah agli aiuti umanitari e incoraggiare i lavoratori e i poveri di tutto il Medio Oriente e del Nord Africa a spodestare i loro governanti mega-ricchi in tutta la regione.
  </p>
<p>
   Per porre fine alla povertà capitalista, alla guerra e alla distruzione dell’ambiente è necessario costruire sindacati indipendenti e partiti dei lavoratori con programmi socialisti, democratici e internazionalisti.
