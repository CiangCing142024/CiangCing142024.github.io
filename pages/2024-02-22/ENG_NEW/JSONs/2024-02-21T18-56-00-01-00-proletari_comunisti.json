Experts expressed \n Shock for the relationships that indicate deliberate attacks and killings \n extrajudicial to Palestinian women and children, some of whom, \n According to reports, they held pieces of white fabric in hand while \n They were killed by the Israeli army or by the affiliated forces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  United Nations experts highlighted detention \n arbitrary of hundreds of Palestinian women and girls from 7 October, \n including defenders of human rights, journalists and humanitarian operators. \n According to reports, many prisoners have undergone inhuman treatments \n  and degrading, including the refusal of basic necessities (such as \n Absorbents, food and medicines) as well as serious beatings. Have been reported \n  cases of sexual violence, including cases of rape, with prisoners \n presumably subjected to searches by male officers \n of the Israeli army and threatened with further sexual violence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, there is disturbing news of Palestinian women and children, \n including babies, who disappeared after contact with the Israeli army, \n Some of which are transferred by force to Israel. Experts have \n requested an in -depth and impartial investigation by underlining that these \n acts would constitute serious violations of international human rights e \n  of humanitarian law, potentially equivalent to crimes \n persecutable in accordance with international criminal law.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"The managers must be held responsible\", have \n The experts underlined, \u201cand the victims and their families deserve \n full repair and justice \".
