That is, it is a speech of the mouth of the poor, the disqualified, the inhabitants of the tenement/favela, the suburb.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Originally it was a speech of these popular classes, where there was a lot of immigrant. I would say, however, that in the 1940s Lunfardo is already a polyclassist and crosses all ages.

Thus, \"Bac\u00e1n\" would be the person given to good life, travel, designer clothes, etc.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, for some, the etymology would proceed from Italy, the old genoese language, from the jabra now unused \"baccan\" with the meaning of boss, owner of the house/farm, owner or chief of ship that as a sign of command was carrying a staff called \" Bacco \u201d(something like\u201c staff \u201din Portuguese).\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   <em>\n    Cana \u2013\n   </em>\n  </strong>\n  Police.
