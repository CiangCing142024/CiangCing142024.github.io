We have a great responsibility and legacy that Otto left us, which has to do with fighting to guarantee the historical continuity of a line of proletarian hegemony that can play a role from the point of view of the triumph of the revolution in Argentina and that has to See with defending with all the line of the game. \u201d And finally he added that \"the story of Otto Vargas has not finished writing, because a communist, a revolutionary is not judged only by what he has done throughout his militant life, but for what he leaves\" .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In a full room, with the enthusiasm of validity, conviction and revolutionary passion that otto brings us, this sense tribute closed with everyone chanting in a loud voice: \u00abThey all scream, shout strong, Otto Vargas even Victory always!\".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-68181\" height=\"215\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" src=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/charla-JCR-sobre-Otto-Vargas-en-Rosario-300x163.jpg\" srcset=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/charla-JCR-sobre-Otto-Vargas-en-Rosario-300x163.jpg\" width=\"396\"/>\n  </p>\n  <hr/>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Painted and stickers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <h5>\n   Chacarita, Caba\n  </h5>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-68182\" height=\"202\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" src=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pintadas-por-Otto-Vargas-Chacarita-300x155.jpg\" srcset=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pintadas-por-Otto-Vargas-Chacarita-300x155.jpg\" width=\"391\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <h5>\n   FLORENCIO VARELA, BS.
