Much of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure is destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   It is the greatest military conflict in Europe since World War II in the last century.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Ukraine is currently in a difficult military situation. But his people tireless and heroically fighting the progress of the Russian forces, which keep a large part of the territory, together with the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula that occurred in 2014. Ukraine caused tens of thousands of casuals to the Russian army, between dead dead and injured. Despite the adversity and inferiority of troops and armaments, Ukrainian forces continue to hit Russian forces.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) a military alliance between the United States, which remains the main economic, political and military superpower, and more than 30 countries in Europe, including England, Germany and France, has put its claws in This war, giving financial support, warlike equipment and military advice to the Ukraine government.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Until now, NATO has prevented its troops from entering the war. Ukraine is not part of this alliance, although the countries that share border with it do, some of them, such as Poland, border with Russia. In 2023 Finland joined, which shares more than 1,000 km from its border with Russia. Sweden is close to entering the Alliance.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Since January 24, NATO is carrying out the largest military exercises in its history, with the deployment of more than 90 thousand soldiers, dozens of combat aircraft, helicopters, tanks, \"innumerable unmanned aerial vehicles\", war wars , aircraft carrier, etc. \"The exercise is designed to simulate the response of the 31 nations alliance to an attack of an opponent like Russia,\" NATO commanders allowed to transcend Western media.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Russia responds to the planning of these maneuvers and the Russian Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs declared \u201cthese exercises are another element of the hybrid war that the West is unleashing against Russia. An exercise in this magnitude (...) marks the definitive and irrevocable return of NATO to the schemes of the Cold War, when the process of military planning, resources and infrastructure were prepared for a confrontation with Russia \u00bb.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In Russia, confirming Putin's control over the government for the next elections, Alexei Navalny prison appeared in prison, a well -known opponent to the Russian president. The government of this imperialist power tries to silence the cost of war in Ukraine, with thousands of dead and tens of thousands of young people who leave the country to avoid being recruited.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In Europe, Germany handles the highest military budget in decades, and tries to position itself as a continental leader after the failure of its policy of containing Russia through trade, through the purchase of gas and oil. It is estimated that to replenish the amount of weapons that Europe sent to Ukraine it will have between 5 and 10 years, according to the head of Rheinmetall, the main monopoly of German armaments. More than 12,000 German soldiers began to carry out military exercises, preparing for war.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   While Chinese imperialism raises \"neutrality\" in this conflict, all its actions show alignment with the Russians. At the beginning of February, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in a telephone conversation with Putin that \"Russia and China must collaborate closely to defend their safety and oppose foreign interference.\" Last year Xi Jinping had declared a \"friendship without limits with Putin.\" China is very interested in the trade of its electronic production with Russia (bordering country) and wants to take advantage of the price in Russian gas and oil.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   <strong>\n    The war in Ukraine gets into the Yankees elections\n   </strong>\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   In November of this year the presidential elections will be held in the United States. The current president of Yankee imperialism, Joe Biden, of the Democratic Party, has aspirations for re -election. His main contender is former Yankee President and current Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Biden is claiming the Yankee Congress to approve 60,000 million dollars in military aid for Ukraine within a broader war pack that also includes about 14,000 million dollars for Israel, and another sum for Taiwan. The Yankee Military Industrial Complex is making immense profits with the increase in the danger of war between the imperialist powers, and the fogonea.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Tump, on the other hand, that puts conditions to this multimillionaire package in Congress, Polvarda lifted last week saying that if NATO European countries did not update with NATO's expenses, if he were president he would not defend them before an eventual Russian attack.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After these statements, NATO general secretary Jens Stoltenberg clarified that 18 countries of the 31 members reached an expense of 2% of their GDP in the military budget. NATO countries will invest more than 380 billion dollars in rearma They suffer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   <strong>\n    War factors grow rapidly\n   </strong>\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   All imperialisms are present in the war in Ukraine, which marks a very important milestone as a factor of World War. Since the end of last year, these factors have joined Israel's genocidal attacks to Palestine, which already caused more than 30,000 civilians and more than two million displaced Palestinians. Another focus of growing conflict is the one that faces imperialist China with Taiwan, sustained by the Yankees and other powers, with all the consequences on the control of the China Sea.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   All these war factors aggravate the condition of oppressed countries, and also in the workers and peoples of imperialist countries: inflation and unemployment rates are reaching record values worldwide. Great Britain and Japan have officially announced last week that their economies entered into recession. The exit of the cyclic crises of capitalism is, for imperialist countries, always with wars.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Two years after the Russian imperialist invasion of Ukraine, we reaffirm what was raised by the 13th Congress of our party, in October 2022: \u201cFrom the PCR we repudiate the Russian invasion to Ukraine. We reaffirm all our solidarity with the Ukrainian people we oppose the imperialist war. Neither Russia, the United States and NATO. Ukraine has the right to decide his destiny. We defend the sovereignty and self -determination of peoples. We continue to denounce both Russian imperialism and the intervention of Yankee and NATO imperialism, which put the world to the edge of a new imperialist confrontation that will only bring more blood and pain to the peoples of the world. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <h5>\n   Photo: Advance map of Russian troops in Ukrainian territory\n  </h5>\n  <p>\n   Today N \u00b0 1999 02/21/2024\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n </div>\n <!-- .entry-content -->\n</div>\n", "source": "https://pcr.org.ar/nota/dos-anos-de-la-invasion-imperialista-rusa-a-ucrania/", "type": "article", "title": "Two years of Russian imperialist invasion to Ukraine", "description": "This resistance in Ukraine transformed the imperialist invasion into a national war, with thousands of dead and civilians, millions of displaced and entire devastated regions.
