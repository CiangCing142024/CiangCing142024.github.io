<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   As the story shows, on January 21, 1924, Comrade Lenin became the great leader of the working class and the oppressed peoples in the world, the other great milestone for Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, immortal and left behind a great legacy of incomprehensible value. Comrade Lenin's teachings, which transformed the "world of the future", whose basics were laid by Marx and Engels, from an abstract opportunity for a concrete reality, is still fully relevant after a century of major upheavals in the world. In order to position yourself correctly in the class struggle, one must accept this "timeliness" and orient yourself after it. At the same time, this "timeliness" is a cure for reformist, revisionist and parliamentary cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of all kinds. It is the guarantee of faith and determination that a communist world can be created.

</h3>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Properly identifying the contradictions in the history of the class struggle, understanding the moments of historical crimes and being ready in these times was the most prominent element of comrade Lenin's entire struggle until his immortality. After Marx and Engel's death, the leadership of the international proletariat was taken over for a long time by the second international opportunism, and in the word of comrade Stalin:
   <b>
    "A period when others
   </b>
<b>
    I
   </b>
<b>
    the parties of the nternational were not
   </b>
<b>
    able to
   </b>
<b>
    Take over the theoretical struggle to free the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world from the influence of these opportunistic and class compromising social democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle for the liberation of the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples in the world, with the founding of Communist
   </b>
<b>
    I
   </b>
<b>
    He developed the International a form of organization and struggle adapted to the dynamics of the class struggle during the new period of capitalism. "
   </b>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin turned the Communist Party and the Communist International into an instrument for war against the bourgeoisie by liberating the Communist Party and the Communist International's movement from the buoys of legal forms of fighting:
   <b>
    “Instead of revolutionary politics - dehydrated toblorerism and snus -widely politicizing, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary combinations. For the sake of, of course, 'revolutionary' decisions were made and adopted 'revolutionary' slogan ... '
   </b>
   But as it "stores in the drawers", freed from legal forms of struggle.
   <b>
    “However, a new stage of imperialist war and the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat was approaching. The old fighting methods proved to be manifestly insufficient and powerless towards the omnipotance of financial capital. It was necessary to revise the entire international work, all of its working method, to expel the tobogganing, narrow -mindedness, politicization, the overflow, social chauvinism and social pacifism. It was necessary to try the entire international Arsenal, to throw out all rusty and murky and forge new weapons. Without such preparatory work, it would be worthless to go out in the field against capitalism. Without this, the proletariat risked suddenly to face new revolutionary affects without being sufficiently equipped or even completely uneven. The honor of this general examination and general cleansing of the second international Augiasstall fell on the lot of Leninism. "
   </b>
   (Stalin, the basics of Leninism)
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin, with his genius, took the core of the contradiction and realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off the burdens that weigh on the back of the international proletariat, without fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses the true nature of these Opinions in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary link between the "internal struggle" and the "outer struggle", he fought the double struggle.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin gave us communists the extremely important lesson that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of governing reactions. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be cleared from revisionism and opportunism.
  </span>
</p>
<h3>
<span style="font-size: 22px;">
<strong>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
     Keep high Lenin's teachings within the intersecting contradiction of the imperialist system
    </span>
</strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   The imperialist system, which comrade Lenin analyzed in detail in the early 1900s, has survived during the past period, but its contradictions are tightened and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the resolution of the Soviet Union and the integration process in the capitalist system that China went through prevented the contradictions from exploding for a while, the law on the unequal development of capitalism continued and the interimperistic rivalry developed at the stage of "resolution". with regional war. This shows which crisis system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who for a long time maintained their crisis by moving the system's burdens to the semi -colonies and deepening the looting of the semi -colonies, has also ended up in a dead end.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   One of the explosive points in the inherent problems of the imperialist system, which has been developed in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism is that the interim materialist struggle, which has been shown in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought in regional war. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the interimmeristic contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.

   We can see that the development is in line with comrade Lenin's observations on the nature and contradictions of imperialism:
   <b>
    “The second contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for raw material sources, about foreign areas. Imperialism involves capital exports to the raw material sources, a furious struggle for the monopoly possession of these sources, struggle for the already divided world's new division, a struggle as new financial groups and powers in search of a 'place in the sun' with special rage against the old groups and powers, which Stubbornly clinging to the prey. This furious struggle between the different capitalist groups is remarkable to such an extent that one of its inevitable elements is imperialist war, war for the conquest of foreign areas. This circumstance is, in turn, remarkable that it leads to the mutual weakening of the imperialists, to a weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to the speed of the proletarian revolution, to the practical necessity of this Revolution. "
   </b>
   (Stalin, Leninism's basics).
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Russia and China, the former socialist countries that have given the imperialist system a respite with their new markets, have become the main actors in the interim materialist rivalry, in violation of hegemonic power the United States. This means that the extent and nature of the contradictions has increased as new and powerful players are gaining increasing commitment to the struggle for the redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with Russian imperialism's invasion of Ukraine took place against this background. It is predictable that this tendency will be further deepened and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, the areas where the split wars are carried out half colonies and colonies. The half -colonies and the oppressed peoples in the world will continue to pay the price for these wars until the imperialists declare direct war against each other.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   With this
   <i>
    the division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries
   </i>
   - Masterly analyzed by Lenin - deepens even more. The third contradictions are tightened with the imperialist looting, and the semi -colonial and semi -feodal increase in powerful national liberation war and folk war that shakes the imperialist system.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Parallel to the process where imperialism goes under contradictions, the interimplyistic and the contradiction imperialist countries and oppressed people and nations; All parts of the governing system, especially the imperialist states, become more centralized, militaristic and warlike than before, which paves the way for all fascist emotions to bring society into a corresponding ideological format. This is met either by so -called right -wing extremists or under the veil of social democratic or liberal parties. Communists and the oppressed peoples in the world, in front of the reality of a system that every day becomes more reactionary and aggressive, needs a Leninist party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power, as comrade Lenin outlined, to organize a strong opposition to this reaction. Only such a party, today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, can lead an irreconcilable fight against the bourgeoisie.

    A revolution is not a dinner party or like writing an essay or painting a painting or embroidery. It cannot be particularly refined, particularly quiet and mild, especially moderate, friendly, polite, mastered or magnificent. A revolution is a rebellion, a act of violence, where one class crashes another.
   </b>
   (Mao Zedong).

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they position themselves before the development. During the hundreds that have passed since comrade Lenin's death, the imperialists have transformed their governing structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police officers, intelligence services etc. are equipped with capacity that is incomparable to the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignore this reality (although it seems theoretically accepted) and is far from positioning itself accordingly. But by following an ideological and practical reconciliation line that locks the working class and the oppressed masses in the governing system, they dampen the anger of the masses and act as a breakwater. While the imperialists and the governance's governing structures are equating themselves with increasingly violent appliances and institutions, it is necessary as supporters of comrade Lenin, to keep a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionaries" and "communists" go further further And further away from reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. Taking Comrade Lenin's relentless fight against the second international opportunism as a guide against these views is one of the important tasks to make comrade Lenin justice during the centenary of his immortality.
  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   Comrade Lenin defined the new type of Communist Party as the "proletariat's war organization". This definition was necessary because of the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the Civil War that broke out with the October Revolution were the concrete reasons why Comrade Lenin called the Communist Party "The War Organization of the Proletariat". It is a necessity that the Communist Party, which will lead the liberation of the proletariat and the oppressed masses, has this property, while the counter -revolution armed from top to toe with the device's apparatus and means and commits all these terrible massacres against the working class and the oppressed peoples. A revolutionary war needs a fighting party to bring it. Only fools and indefinite auditors who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.

<b>
    Some people ridicule us as advocates of "the general of war". Yes, we advocate the omniption of the revolutionary war; It's good, not bad, it's Marxist. Russia's Communist Party's rifle created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. The experience of the class struggle during the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only with the power of the rifle that the working class and the working masses can defeat the bourgeoisie and the landlords, both of which are armed. In this sense, we can say that only with rifles can the whole world be transformed.

   At its founding conference, IKF defined the constituency and reconstitution of the communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party developed by Comrade Mao Zedong is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party that Comrade Lenin outlined and also enriched by Stalin, and is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party in Marxism-Leninism-Maoism's ideology. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions in which we are located, the Communist Party that is capable of opposing the growing imperialist reaction and leading the proletariat and the oppressed peoples in the world must have the quality of being the "proletariat's war organization".

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   An essential heritage from Lenin is the question of political power as the fundamental issue for each revolution. Lenin showed how
   <b>
    "The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without being replaced with a new"
   </b>
   and how
   <b>
    ”ut

<b>
    Power is

   </b>
   . Under Lenin's personal leadership of the world's first socialist state, the dictatorship of the proletariat was established, which specified the proletarian path to power and to maintain it.

<p>
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: bahnschrift;">
   After Lenin's death, it was his sequel Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it and made it the foundation for the entire international communist movement. Based on the great Lenin's shoulders, chairman Mao was able to bring the proletarian world revolution to higher heights and develop the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism that is today Marxism-Leninism-Maoism must be embraced, defended and applied today.

   As IKF, we will continue to perform the tasks that the great Lenin brought up and benefit from the legacy that Comrade Lenin has left to us.

  National minorities in Sitio Dalicno, Barangay Ampucao, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet, Benguet Production Sharing Agreement 103 (APSA 103) in the ITogon-Suyoc Resources, Inc. They say, many irregularities in the process of taking Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) at the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) so it is eligible for it. Isri is a company owned by the Apex Mining Corporation Inc. by Enrique Razon Jr.
 </p>
<p>
  According to Dalicno Indigenous Peoples Organization (DIPO), NCIP Gimip is to take FPIC. It is not enough for its shared information to the assemblies that lead to the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement on September 20, 2023. It also removes the approval of the affected communities, which is appropriate for the process of oppression.
 </p>
<p>
  "The issue is divided into the people's people. The Dalicno community, organizing self in Dico, is only treated as 'breakaway group' and has been released evil in the 'authorized indigenous organizations.' However, Dalicno stood ... as legitimate stakeholders because the legitimate stakeholder because the The earth, their life and livelihood are dangerous (the project), "the organization's statement.
 </p>
<p>
  The APSA 103 is 581 acres in the villages of Ampucao, Poblacion, and Virac in Itogon, Benguet. The operations of Mina will take place throughout Dalicno, with their water sources, sacred graves, schools and churches called "build-up zones."
 </p>
<p>
  The Dalicno people believe that although the "build-up zones" can be "no mining zone" and become "buffer zone" as watersources will not be affected by mine. They said, the effect of mine was very clear, especially with the APEX Mining owner, in recent landslide in Masara, Maco, Davao de Oro.s

<p>
  The danger of landslides on February 6th in Maco, Davao de Oro (former Compostela Valley) is the worst of many tragedies in Mindanao, and the Davao de Oro one of the Philippine mine, and not first at the center of the Philippines Apex Mining Corporation. The people have been around the whole region of Davao, and the natives of Mindanao against the massive and vulnerable mine.
 </p>
<p>
  In the face of its tragedy, and contrary to fake discouragement and provoking good, neither did apex stop its operations and continue to occupy the remaining workers of mine.
 </p>
<h3>
  History of Understanding and Spanish
 </h3>
<p>
  Apex mining began in the legacy of the Mansaka tribe in 1976. Like elsewhere, it was not only destroyed the ecology of the forests and lands, also destroyed the traditional livelihoods and culture of the Mansaka. In the following years, the mansakers were slowly evicted to their communities, and they were enslaved as workers in its mines or support systems.
 </p>
<p>
  Even before, it is notorious to the low-shaped and unsafe labor conditions. Its operation was suspended in 2000 after the workers were charged. It returns to the dynamic mining under the management of foreign Goldridge Mining Corporation companies (US US), Viclode Mining Corporation, and Mintricor Inc. In 2003. The Mine Gold was purchased (which was formerly in the Canadian company) in 2009, also selling Asvi (Malaysia) in 2009. In 2013, it was purchased at the Monte Razon Jr and his compradors.
 </p>
<p>
  APEX's current minimal minimum of MPSA-MPSA-225-2005-XI to cover 679.02 hectares in the aggregate villages of Masara and Teresa, and MPSA-234-2007-XIs of 1,558.53 hectares Barangay in Masara, hot, Tagbaros, New Leyte, Elizalde and New Barili in Maco and some parts of the adjacent town of Mabini. In 2023, the company further expanded operations when it purchased the Asia Alliance Mining Resources Corp. with a permit to minimize 20,000 hectares of Maco, Mabini and Marvel, all in Davao de Oro.
 </p>
<p>
  There are 25 years, which can also be ploted 25 years, two MPSA or 2030 and 2032. In the same two MPSAs, it is estimated to obtain 1,250,000 eleven gold. In 2022, the company spent ₱ 3.339 billion net income, which was largely 316.1% compared to 2021. In 2023, it recorded ₱ 2.3 billion net we were in the first nine months.
 </p>
<p>
  Bugs in the native treasure, the reactionary state only paid for 4% excise tax. The company has always been delayed to provide crumbs of 1% obligation to its local government and tribe. After almost four decades, the only joke of the apex contribution to the community is a school and a health center. Its housing for its own worker is still built with a non-governmental organization. Tribunal and slaves and slaves remain one of the most degradation of the country.
 </p>
<p>
  The company has made it right in the company, the ery it comes to mine is always raised, worst in the middle of November and February. The soil is so soft and vulnerable to the hoarse of the shop. It is also located in a Fault Line (Breakfast), and vulnerable to earthquake. In another state study, 80% of Davao de Oro is declared "Geohazard". Between this, not only maintained, Hindunua, the Apex is still condemning its operations in the prubinth.
 </p>
<p>
  In the estimation of the attitudes, many incidents of land for land are not reported. In addition to the open-pit mining of Apex, the company produces tunnels under the earth. It encourages the soil and stones under, who increases the possibility of the shop of the great chunk.
 </p>
<h3>
  History of violence
 </h3>
<p>
  Like elsewhere, Davao de Oro's violence is mining. The next reactionary regime has launched the brutal repression and militarization throughout the Mansaka community. In 2017, less than three bunches of AFP have been reduced from the AFP from the ere, political civilians to "surrender," killing mass and ordinary civilians, and other detention, and other abbreviation and emptying.
 </p>
<p>
  Torridge the province of CAFGU detachments and military camps serving as guards and protectors in mine operations. The 66th IB contributes to the 10th ID command. The list of war crimes and violations of the human rights of the division is not only in the Davao region but even in Bukidnon, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur.
 </p>
<p>
  The victims of the 66th IB include Marcelo Monterona, killed by soldiers in January 2014 in front of his store. Monterona is at the Council of Indug People, the organization that leads the apex mining to the injury to the farmers and native communities. In 2013, the Apex was moved by the organization to pay ₱ 3.6 million and arrange the corrupt infrastructure after their hurricane paul community hit.
 </p>
<p>
  On April 10, 2014, Red fighters under the New People's Army - Southern Mindanao Region's mine in Apex as a punishment for continuing to expand its undergrounds and open-pit mining. This is between the repeated warning of the revolutionary movement of the warm injury to the expansion of the Mine of Indigenous and Nature's communities.
 </p>
<p>
  During this time, the company extends the company of the remaining foresee of Maco, which was declared protected by the revolutionary people in the area. Among other seashells in Apex; 1) Do not pay damages to the victims in the two landslides in 2007 and 2008, 2) under its workforce, 3) failed rehabilitation of the rivers and bridges it promised Residents, and 4) Active funding combat operations in the 9th IB have been able to form a former Province.
 </p>
<p>
  The Military was declared in the 2022 "insurgency-free" the Davao de Oro and celebrated it with large mines. In spite of this, some AFP battalions remained at the native and workers' communities to suppress the unanimous resistance to the people. In the face of continuing to rotate and tread the right and especially before the blasphemy, the people's heart continues to burn and resist.

  Justice is tying families with more than 100 dead in the land of Masara, Maco, Davao de Oro in February 6. Justice their asking because they have been the death of their loved ones not a simple accident or Natural tragedy, but the conditions created by the greed of profitable and conspirators - the capitalist and armed in the state.
 </p>
<p>
  Although all the dead bodies have been destroyed when the land has raised, the Marcos government has been arrested by the Apex Mining Corporation, the greatest company that produces mines in the area. Enrique Razon's Apex, one of the largest bourgeoisie-comprador to the country of the underwater supporters of Marcos who gained great government contracts. Even in the protection of Mark, Razon cannot cover his responsibility for the death of 100 people of Maco common workers or company workers.
 </p>
<p>
  The Maco's tragedy reminds many of the disasters in Mindanao, Cordillera, Marinduque, and other areas of vulnerable mines, plantations, energy projects, ecotalism and incessant build infrastructure. Due to the extinction of the forest and mountains, millions of Filipinos have been victims every year in land avenues and abundant floods in the urban and rural areas of abundance, livelihoods and more difficulties.
 </p>
<p>
  Long time to hold foreign multinational companies in the Philippines. The companies are free and abundantly entered during the US-Marcos dictatorship that pocketed the kikbaks in its operations. Of the fibil of the neoliberal policy of liberalization and deregulation, and at the fault of the mini "mining for development," it is given the mining act of 1995. This gives the whole foreign mines. In the Philippines, especially to mining gold, copper, nickel, chromite, zinc and other minerals, which are further aggravated by the warm incidence of nature.
 </p>
<p>
  In history, American companies mainly support the largest operation of the country. Meanwhile, such companies have been owned or funded by American companies and banks, Canadian, Chinese and Australian. The mine in the Philippines does not serve the local economy. The country has expanded mineral digests, mainly for Chinese and Japan steel industries.
 </p>
<p>
  All over the world, minimal operations have worsened by the imperialist countries of the largest quarry of raw materials. During the past two decades, demand for Nickel throughout the world, mainly because of the size of China (which consists of 60% of the total nickel supply) for the iron industry, greatly in It is a great capital for infrastructure projects on the so-called belt and road initiative.
 </p>
<p>
  The tragedy of Apex Mining will surely follow the future in the face of complete opening of the Marcos regime in the country of foreign business that will continue to provide a path to self-esteem. Mulina, agination, energy, tourism, and imprastuch, and imprastuch, and imprastuch are in various provinces throughout the country. These companies will further plunder as Marcos plans the constitution to open the door to foreign plawers.
 </p>
<p>
  A few decades were raised, suppressed, removing and laid the natives in Mindanao, and national minorities and farmers in various parts of the country. It is done in favor of foreign companies and great capitalist and bureaucrat parties. Under Marcos, brutal contradictions and terrorism continues to have raised the state of the people who block foreign mining and destruction.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the AFP is declared "Insurgency-free" the Davao de Oro and the AFP's combat providers, the AFP's combat troops are still considering communities camps to destroy the people and to block their resistance. AFP has a mine, the AFP is available to spread fascism. Many of these units have served as a private army to pay for the mine companies to protect their security.
 </p>
<p>
  The Maco tragedy motivated the Filipino people to intensify foreign mines and national and wealth of the country from the mountains to the sea. The Filipino masses must be hugged and raised their consciousness and determination that the great companies destroyed the nature, including the AFP dropping for the forest.
 </p>
<p>
  The massive mass moves must be launched to prevent the more destruction of nature and avoid new tragedies, repeating the mountains, and protect the country's patrimony for the people of the people of the people. The role of mass movement of mass minorities and mass setlers is directly understood directly with the effect of regulating nature. So they also first attacked the fascist AFP to give the operations of foreign companies. They have a farmer's movement and other democratic forces in the urge to strengthen the mass movement of wealth and nationality.
 </p>
<p>
  The revolutionary armed struggle is the most effective approach to nature protection. The new People's Army has been able to confirm the strength and determination of this penalty or completely prevent foreigners in nature and dilute the killing spear of the brilliant reactionary state. In the presence of the Marcos regime, the NPA's foreign companies, the NPA is more likely to increase the benefit of the masses and nature.

  The recent weeks of arrest, espionage and harassment of military elements against progressive and activists in the Region of Negros, Bicol and Southern Tagalog have recorded in recent weeks.
 </p>
<p>
  In Negros Occidental, police arrested Pertinisa Jereula Charita, 55, while visiting her husband in jail in San Carlos City on February 13. According to human rights advocates Negros (Hran), police arrested Charit .
 </p>
<p>
  Charita, a member of the Brother-Negros and the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW), was the wife of Leon Charita, who was arrested in September 2019 in a case of illegal possession of firearms and explosives. Pertinisa was with her children and grandchildren when she visited Leon to commemorate her birthday in jail.
 </p>
<p>
  In Albay, 9th ID soldiers have traveled and attacked the relatives of Farmer's Assistance for Resource Management, Education and Rehabilitation Incorporated (Farmer Inc) members Maggie Seva, its administrative official, and stap Fidel Mirando during the first part of February. The relatives of the two were subject to illegal interrogation.
 </p>
<p>
  In Rizal, an element of the 2nd ID in Barangay San Isidro, Antipolo City, Rizal was housed from the second week of February and in question of mass leaders of the progressive movement in Rizal. The soldier was civilized and pretended to be an employee of Antipolo City Hall to carry out the espionage. According to neighbors, the soldiers are taking them personal information and numbers in the Masa leaders' cellphone.
 </p>
<p>
  In Oriental Mindoro, military and police personnel were in trouble with fishermen and humanitarian groups conducting a boat construction project in Naujan on February 7. The project aims to distribute boats and fishing equipment to those affected by the oil spill when last year. After the program was ruined, the military had no shame that the program was part of the National Task Force-ELCAC campaign.

<div class="article__content">
<p>
  Always nervous, always stressed (aligaga). Of course, we are just living there, ”shared Aling Myrna, wife of jeepney and also conductor in the wake, when asked in the Marcos regime program Public Utility Vehicles (PUV) phaseout. This is the general feeling of drivers and operators, their wives and families, even though the date of forced consolidation of the franchises is re -elected at the end of April.
 </p>
<p>
  In recent months, Aling Myrna has joined the struggle and stands up to restore the independent franchise and eventually dismiss the bogus PUV Modernization Program. Like him, 51-year-old Aling Jenny also joined in actions to fight for their livelihood.
 </p>
<h3>
  What can we live with?
 </h3>
<p>
  Aling Myrna's wife has been a jeepney in a city in Metro Manila for sixteen years in a city in Metro Manila. If Aling Myrna's work as a supervisor was previously involved in a Passage, they would now be dependent on the end of the way when she became ill and dismissed during the work. He used to pay low ₱ 15,000 per month and had no benefits. However, this is a great help in joining their expenses.
 </p>
<p>
  Currently, the couple and the couple earn ₱ 2,800 in the day-to-day day. But only ₱ 850 will be clean home every 12 hours of travel. This was after deducting the ₱ 800 recovery, ₱ 150 per day rent in the rented room, and ₱ 1,000 fuel costs. They have also been a huge shock to the relentless increase in oil prices in the last seven weeks.
 </p>
<p>
  Aling Myrna and her husband are worried about the PUV phaseout -based PUV phaseout because of her practice. “My wife, nervous, was when the phaseout was reported. Of course he was really embarrassed ... He was not used to other transportation, ”he explained.
 </p>
<p>
  If they were left on the road, he did not know where they would take on a daily basis. In the meal, the couple spends ₱ 300 a day. He mocked the government's ₱ 63 daily diet for a person's "recommendation" for a person. “So? What are you going to do, a dry one? ” he said.
 </p>
<p>
  Add to spending his maintenance drug of ₱ 200 per day, including insulin. They are also currently studying their Grade 8 children in the province.
 </p>
<p>
  Aling Jenny and her husband have been driving for 17 years. They are worried, especially and the operator of their jeep does not include consolidation. The operator said seven units would give up seven units, so he refused.
 </p>
<p>
  If they lose a jeepney, he said, his wife will just look for another job. "We couldn't do anything," he said. Now he is sidelining the cafe sales in the garage of their route. There are six children and five of them are still studying. One is only in grade 1.
 </p>
<h3>
  Withdrawing from forced consolidation
 </h3>
<p>
  According to conservative government data in December 2023, 1,767 jeepney routes nationwide did not consent to the consolidation, or 31% of the total 5,716 jeep routes. Of the routes subject to consolidation, the consolidation level is 727 less than 60%. The number of non -consolidated jeep routes in Bicol is the maximum of 451 or 68% of the total route in the region. While 35% of the Metro Manila jeepney route has no consolidation of jeepney franchises.
 </p>
<p>
  The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) boasts that the number of consolidation has been “increasing” since the era of the consolidation period. However, the driver's and operators are reporting the abolition of some of their members in the forced scheme.
 </p>
<p>
  Because the corruption has been exposed to the depths of forced consolidation and PUV modernization, drivers and operators are now recovering the franchise of forced consolidation. They are afraid to be like the many lost and eventually killed by the livelihood.
 </p>
<p>
  The Land Transportation Office (LTO) continues to force drivers and operators who are undergoing consolidation of franchises and said their jeepneys will be considered a collar if they continue to drive. It even threatened to be a "crime" and could face fine and imprisonment.
 </p>
<p>
  While the implementation of the consolidation, which is part of the bogus PUV modernization program, the livelihood of drivers and operators and their families is also hanging. Their cry is unanimous in front of it: return the individual franchise, dismiss the forced consolidation and its fake modernization program.

<div class="article__content">
<p>
  Once again the capitalists, their defenders of Congress and state agencies have grown up with the "adverse effects" of the economic wage and the workers themselves. “Small businesses will close!” "The charge and the price will rise!" And worst of all, "it will hurt the workers!"
 </p>
<p>
  It will be refuted to refute these disadvantages. In the study of the Bird Foundation in the history of wage increase in the country, it has proven that not all wage increases increase the price of goods and charges. In fact, there are many opportunities for inflation, six months after raising wages.
 </p>
<p>
  This is just a speculation, especially since it has no resources in Philippine history that shows that wage increases have a direct impact on rising prices. In practical experience, inflation of inflation has increased without a small wage increase.
 </p>
<p>
  Clearly, it does not include the unlucky increase in the price of commodities. In December 2023, there was only ₱ 505.23 worth of minimum wage in the National Capital Region of ₱ 610/day. The situation in other regions across the country is even worse.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also not true that the "small companies" will be lost if the wages are raised by ₱ 100/day or to make the wage ₱ 750/day or even ₱ 1,100/day. First, the "Micro" businesses do not cover the "micro" businesses (most of the owners of the family or unpaid family workers). There are also many ways for small companies with 20 workers down, such as providing a state of financial assistance to them, low interest in loans, charging them less or no taxes, stepping up at high prices of material for production and transportation charges and much more.
 </p>
<p>
  In fact, the law will cover the large businesses that make up millions of income but will not increase wages until the unions or the state are not pushed, when it is forced by the labor movement. This is the modest of the malls of the SY family's malls, which pays the minimum of shopkeepers and cabinets, despite its growing income each year.
 </p>
<p>
  There is no shame that big capitalists use the "losses" of small businesses to cover a reasonable call for them to provide living wages to their workers.
 </p>
<p>
  Second, it is not true that the workers are "big majority" to "irrelevant" in wages. More than half (51.4% or 3,163, 581 out of a total of 6,155,893) workers in the formal sector work with large companies that earn billions of pesos, and thus have the basis of insist -they families. They will use extra income to fill their minimum needs, such as food and transportation, which is largely produced by local farmers or services provided by both small income.
 </p>
<p>
  Third, less than 6.7% will be reduced to the income of the large and medium -sized enterprises if the wages are raised by ₱ 100. Even micro revenue and small enterprises can only be reduced by 7.6%-7.9%.
 </p>
<p>
  On the other hand, larger costs, more meaningful and fair wage workers will enjoy. In fact, ₱ 100 extra will mean a low ₱ 2,000 extra month. The ₱ 400 float proposed Congress' wage increase that will mean an additional ₱ 8,000 per month. However, it still does not cover the minimum needs of families, which will need a minimum of ₱ 600 per day wage increase.

  Farmers and women's groups in Mendiola protested on February 14 to call for the dismissal of the Rice Liberalization Law (RLL), which was enacted that same day in 2018. They criticized the liberalization of rice imports that resulted in the increase Especially in rice prices, in contrast to its promise to lower the price.

  More than 100 organizations and individuals under the No to Chacha Network gathered on February 15 to oppose the Marcos regime's plan to change the 1987 Constitution (Charter Change or Chacha), through any form. They also announced the commemoration of the 38th year of the EDSA uprising, which they said was the basis of the constitution.
 </p>
<p>
  Groups oppose attempts to amend the Constitution through false People's Initiative or Constituent Assembly. According to them, these attempts are “unnecessary, divorced, expensive, and focused primarily on maintaining the position of those in power.”
 </p>
<p>
  Instead of changing Chacha, groups and individuals calling for those in the position to raise wages and income, lowering prices of commodities and basic yutikiti, repairing social services, suppression of corruption and red tape (Long processes and queues in bureaucracy), promoting human rights, justice and peace, defending sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea, environmental protection and the assurance of clean and credible elections.
 </p>
<p>
  At the gathering were national-democratic organizations, Congressmen of the National Block, members of the 1sta, former government official, church year, student group, teachers, other labor groups and much more. Also present were Justice Antonio Carpio, Commissioner Rene Sarmiento, Atty. Neri Colmenares, Sr. Mary John Mananzan, former DSWD Sec. Judy Taguiwalo, Bishop Gerardo Alminaza, Chairman of the One Negros Ecumenical Council (ONE-C) and Bishop of San Carlos City and many more.
 </p>
<p>
  Pumirma in the declaration of Kiko Pangilinan, Atty. LUTGARDO BARBO ng PDP Laban and UPSICina of Sen. Koko Pimentel, Fr. Daniel Franklin LIPARIO, President of Adamson University, Dr. Noel Leyco, Dating President of the ng angmantasan of the lungsod of Maynila, AT DIWA Gunigundo, DATING DEPUTY GOVERNMENT OF THE central PHILIPPINES.
 </p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, various activities have been launched by various groups to oppose Chacha this month.
 </p>
<p>
  In Bacolod City, church people and democratic organizations gathered on One-C on February 10 to launch a massive campaign against Chacha. On February 8, various individuals in Davao City bind to Way Chacha (no chacha). Various democratic organizations also established the No to Charter Change Coalition-Panay in Iloilo City on February 20.
 </p>
<p>
  On Valentine's Day, farmers and women's Mendiola groups marched to Mendiola against the Rice Liberalization Law. They call: table food, not chacha!
 </p>
<p>
  On February 16, the youth and students of the University Belt in Manila marched to express the opposition to the commercialization of education and the fight against the Marcos regime's long -standing chacha. According to them, Chacha will allow foreign ownership to operate education that will make young people more difficult.
 </p>
<p>
  On the same day, workers in the EDSA Shrine gathered under the call "Extra wage, di Chacha." Prior to this, on February 14, they launched action in front of the Senate, in conjunction with the hearing of the ₱ 100 wage proposal filed in the assembly.

  In the midst of a major military operation in the guerrilla field, red commanders and warriors have determined to launch a training in the basic-military course on January 20-27. The activity aims to arm the warriors of the basic political-military principles to boldly face the counter-revolution of the Marcos regime's counter-revolution campaign.
 </p>
<p>
  Such training is also part of the dominance of the guerrilla field of ideological, political, political and organizational weaknesses of the comprehensive development of the people's war in the area, especially in the field of armed struggle, according to the New People's Army (NPA) -Central Negros.
 </p>
<p>
  "The training has been successful because of the revolutionary cooperation of warriors and commanders, and the relentless mass support of the economy, finance and unit security," the unit said.
 </p>
<p>
  According to Ka Monic, a red warrior woman, "It's really different when you go to bed because you won't be afraid of dealing with the enemy especially and it is part of our central role as an army." Politic-military exercises such as this can be helpful to “avoid military or militarist… because if it should be good for the military, it should be politically well-being,” said Ka Turko, platoon leader and major training instructor.

  Indigenous peoples in Sitio Dalicno, Barangay Ampucao, Itogon, Benguet actively block the imminent strengthening of the Marcos government in the application for production sharing agreement 103 (APSA 103) in Itogon-Suyoc Resources, Inc. (ISRI) that will cover their ancestral land. According to them, there are many irregularities in the process of obtaining the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) so it should be subjected to. Isri is a company owned by Apex Mining Corporation Inc by Enrique Razon Jr.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the Dalicno Indigenous Peoples Organization (DIPO), the NCIP has manipulated the acquisition of FPIC. Its information in the assemblies led to the signing of the Memorandum of Agreement on September 20, 2023. It also did not take the approval of the affected communities, which was the must-have and previous process in Itogon.
 </p>
<p>
  “This issue divided the Itogon citizen. The Dalicno community, who organized itself in Dico, was ignored as the 'Breakaway Group' and released evil by the 'authorized indigenous organizations.' However, Dalicno stands for… as a legitimate stakeholder because the earth, Their lives and livelihoods are the guilty (on the project), ”the organization said.
 </p>
<p>
  APSA 103 will cover 581 hectares of ancestral land in the villages of Ampucao, Poblacion, and Virac in Itogon, Benguet. Mining operations will cover the entire Dalicno Sitio, along with their sources of water, sacred tombs, schools and churches called “build-up zones.”
 </p>
<p>
  The Ladicno people do not believe that it is only because the MOU will be the "no mining zone" and the "build-up zones" will be the "buffer zone" and the watersources will not be affected by the mine. According to them, the impact of mining, especially the Apex Mining owner of Isri, was evident in a landslide in Masara, Maco, Davao de Oro.

<p>
  The catastrophe of landslides on February 6 in Maco, Davao de Oro (former Compostela Valley) is worst of the few tragedies suffered in Mindanao, and in Davao de Oro which is one of the center of mining in the Philippines, and not first involved in the Apex Mining Corporation company. The people throughout the Davao region have long been standing, and the sum of the natives in Mindanao against large and harmful mining.
 </p>
<p>
  In the midst of the tragedy at its gate, and contrary to false sympathy and depression, a minute did not stop its operations and the remaining mine workers continued to work.
 </p>
<h3>
  History of devastating and plunder
 </h3>
<p>
  The Apex began to mine in the Ancestral Land of the Mansaka Tribes in Maco in 1976. As elsewhere, it not only destroyed the ecology of forest and land, it also destroyed the traditional livelihood and culture of the people. In the years that followed, it gradually evacuated the Mansaka to their communities, and they were enslaved as workers in its mine or supported system.
 </p>
<p>
  In the past, this is notorious in low wages and unsafe labor conditions. Its operations were suspended in 2000 after being charged by workers. It returned as large -scale mining under the supervision of foreign Goldridge Mining Corporation (US Company), Viclode Mining Corporation, and Mintricor Inc. In 2003. The mine was purchased by the crew gold (which was then the Canadian Company) in 2009, which sold to ASVI (Malaysia) in 2009. In 2013, Monte Oro bought it by Enrique Razon Jr and his comprador colleagues.
 </p>
<p>
  APEX's currently minimized is subject to two MPSAs-MPSA-225-2005-XI covering 679.02 hectares in the Barangay Mascara and Teresa, and MPSA-234-2007-XI covers 1,558.53 hectare Barangay of Masara, Hot, Tagbaros, New Leyte, Elizalde and New Barili in Maco and parts of the neighboring town of Mabini. In 2023, the company expanded its operations when it bought the Asia Alliance Mining Resources Corp. Holding a permit to mine 20,000 hectares in Maco, Mabini and Maragusan, all in Davao de Oro.
 </p>
<p>
  It has been 25 years, which can extend two MPSAs to an additional 25 years or up to 2030 and 2032. It is estimated to be able to get in the scope of just two MPSAs of 1,250,000 eleven of gold. In 2022, the company scored ₱ 3.339 billion net income, which was 316.1% compared to 2021. In 2023, it recorded a ₱ 2.3 billion net income for just the first nine months.
 </p>
<p>
  In exchange for the plunder of natural resources, the company paid only a 4% excise tax of the reactionary state. The company has constantly delayed providing a low 1% obligation to its local government and tribes. After nearly four decades, the only apex contribution to the community was a school and a health center. The housing it built for its own worker was built along with a non-governmental organization. Most furious, the Tribung Mansaka and slave in their own land remains one of the poorest in the country.
 </p>
<p>
  According to a study conducted by the company itself, its mining occupation is constantly raining, worst between November and February. The soil is packed here and are vulnerable to erosion. It is also in the area with a fault line. In another state study, 80% of Davao de Oro is decided to "geohazard" or dangerous location. Despite these attributes, not only continued, the operations of mine, especially the Apex, were further exacerbated.
 </p>
<p>
  In the forest-by-natural group, many landslides are no longer reported. With the exception of Apex's open-pit mining, the company produces tunnels underground. It shakes the soil and rocks from the bottom, which further increases the possibility of erosion of large mountain chunk.
 </p>
<h3>
  History of violence
 </h3>
<p>
  Like elsewhere, mining is a mining in Davao de Oro. The successive reactionary regime has launched the brutal repression and militarization campaign in the whole mansaka community. In 2017, at least three AFP battalions began the extensive bombing of the air, pressure on civilians to “surrender,” killing mass and ordinary civilians, illegal arrests and detention, and other abuse and harassment
 </p>
<p>
  CAFGU detachments and military camps, which serve as guards and defenders of mine operations, the province. The 66th IB is included in the 10th ID commander. There is a long list of war crimes and violations of the rights of this division not only in the Davao region but also in Bukidnon, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur.
 </p>
<p>
  Among the victims of the 66th IB were Marcelo Monterona, who was killed by soldiers in January 2014, in front of his store. Monterona is a member of the Council of Indug Katalan, the organization leading the charge of Apex Mining on the damage it brings to the farmers and Lumad communities. In 2013, the organization pushed APEX to provide ₱ 3.6 million and repair damaged infrastructure after their typhoon Pablo community.
 </p>
<p>
  On April 10, 2014, Red fighters under the New People's Army-Southern Mindanao region attacked the APEX mine who was still owned by Canadian and Malaysian companies, as a punishment for the continued expansion of underground and open -pit mining it. Despite this, the revolutionary movement has repeatedly warned the widespread damage caused by such expansion to the natives and the environment.
 </p>
<p>
  During this time, the company expanded the remaining forest in Maco, declared protected by the revolutionary citizen in the area. Apex's other sin includes; 1) Not giving the victims of the two landslides in 2007 and 2008, 2) low wages and arbitrary career of its workers, 3) failure to rehabilitate rivers and bridges in Maco that it promises residents, and 4) Active funding of the 9th IB combat operations deployed in the province.
 </p>
<p>
  The military in 2022 declared Davao de Oro "insurgency-free" and celebrated large mine companies. Despite this, some AFP battalions remain in Lumad communities and workers to suppress any people's resistance. In the face of continued pressure and abuse of rights and especially in the face of blasphemy, the people's emotions continue to rise and fight.

  The relatives of the more than 100 casualties of landslides in Masara, Maco, Davao de Oro are shouting justice in February 6. They are demanding justice because they know that the death of their loved ones is not a simple accident or tragedy of nature, but as a result of the condition created by the polls in the pirate and accomplices of the bureaucrat-capitalist and the state's armed personnel.
 </p>
<p>
  Before all the bodies were covered when the land collapsed, the Marcos government immediately defeated the Apex Mining Corporation, the largest company that operates mines in the area. Apex is owned by Enrique Razon, one of Marcos' largest comprador bourgeois comprades in the country who is an avid supporter of the government's major contracts. However, Marcos defends, Razon will not cover his responsibility for the death of 100 in Maco who is mostly workers or working with the company.
 </p>
<p>
  The tragedy in Maco reminds many of the disasters in Mindanao, Cordillera, Marinduque, and other areas as a result of destructive environmental mining, plantations, energy projects, ecotourism and reckless construction of infrastructure. Due to widespread destruction of forests and mountains, millions of Filipinos are victims of landslides and widespread floods in cities and countryside, which causes multiple deaths, livelihood destruction and more poverty .
 </p>
<p>
  Foreign multinational companies have long been holding mining in the Philippines. They were wide and wide-open during the US-Marcos dictatorship, which pocketed the scars in its operations. With the push of neoliberal policy of liberalization and deregulation, and on the veil of false "mining for development," the Mining Act of 1995, which has enacted the entire foreign ownership of companies that run large mines in the Philippines in the Philippines , especially in mining of gold, copper, nickel, chromite, zinc and other minerals, which further intensifies the widespread environment.
 </p>
<p>
  Historically, American companies are behind the largest mining operations in the country. Currently, they are owned or capitalized by American, Canadian, Chinese and Australian companies. Mining in the Philippines does not serve the local economy. Excavated minerals are exported by the country, mainly for steel industries in China and Japan.
 </p>
<p>
  Worldwide, mining operations are increasing in the pursuit of imperialist countries with the cheapest source of raw materials. In the past two decades, demand for nickel has doubled around the world, mainly due to the size of China's imports (which consumes 60% of the total nickel supply) for the steel industry, which is a major part of its excess capital In infrastructure projects at the so-called Belt and Road Initiative.
 </p>
<p>
  The tragedy of Apex Mining will surely follow the coming season in the face of the Marcos regime's full opening of the country's foreign investment which will continue to enable the devastating and polluted operations of hay-to-rock capitalists. Multinational companies in mining, agriculture, energy, tourism, and imprastures are now entering various provinces nationwide. They will get further when Marcos continues to change the Constitution to open the door to foreign pirates.
 </p>
<p>
  For decades the ancestral lands in Mindanao, and indigenous peoples and farmers across the country have been abolished, abolished and robbed. This is done for the sake of foreign companies and large capitalists and bureaucrats. Under Marcos, the state's brutal suppression and terrorism continues to worsen the people who oppose foreign mining and environmentally destructive.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the AFP has declared Davao de Oro "insurgency-free" and southern Mindanao provinces, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) troops are still building camps in communities to conclude the people and hinder their fight. Wherever there is mine, the AFP is there to sow fascism. Many of these units serve as a private army to pay for mining companies to protect their security.
 </p>
<p>
  The tragedy in Maco emphasizes the need for the Filipino people to improve foreign mining and piracy and piracy of the country's environment and wealth from mountains to ocean. The Filipino masses should be explored and raise their awareness and determination to fight large companies that are destroying the environment, as well as the AFP's drop of a forest bomb.
 </p>
<p>
  Wide mobilization of the masses should be launched to prevent further destruction of the environment and avoid new tragedies, re -enact the mountains, and defend the country's patrimony for the benefit of the people's people and democratic government government. It is undeniable that the mass movement of the indigenous peoples and the Setler masses is that they are directly suffering from the destruction of the environment. Thus, they are also the main attackers of the AFP fascist to allow the operation of foreign companies. They are part of the peasant movement, and various democratic forces in the city in strengthening the mass movement in defense of the country's wealth and nature.
 </p>
<p>
  The revolutionary armed struggle is the most effective way of defending the environment. The New People's Army has repeatedly proved its determination and strength to punish or eventually prevent foreign pirates from nature and to abolish the killer spear in the reactionary state. In the face of the widespread introduction of the Marcos regime of foreign mining companies, the NPA needs to reinforce the welfare of the masses and the environment.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  A loud demonstration marched through Vienna on the evening of February 12, the 90th anniversary of the heroic February matches in 1934. Karl-Marx-Hof, which at that time was a central scene for the resistance movement, became a place where they were reminded of the fighters, as with Right is referred to as heroes.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Exactly 90 years ago, the cannons burst into Karl-Marx-HOF when the Austrofascist army shot at inhabited working houses. Thousands rose to Austro Staff in many parts of Austria in February, with weapons in hand. Despite the military defeat, these struggles were crucial to the further development of the resistance struggle against Austrocezism and later against the Nazi occupation. The demonstration on the anniversary was greatly fierce: banners, flags, songs, marches and pyrotechnics ensured that the experience of this fight is still relevant 90 years later.

  The common slogan for the demonstration was "to remember is to fight". It was also expressed in the songs and content of the demonstration, which were aimed at the ongoing settlement of democratic and social rights as well as the rising prohibition policy. Slogine against inflation and wage theft alternated with calls against buildup, against NATO and the defense of Austrian neutrality. Palestinian flags could also be seen as a symbolic expression of international solidarity and friendship between the people, but also against the censorship of the ruling classes and "fair thinking" against the Palestine solidarity.

  A striking vision was a red block at the demonstration, which played an important role in starting the slogans. The block in particular emphasized the importance of the Revolutionary Austria's Communist Party (KPö), which was against the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAPö), now Austria's Social Democratic Party (SPö), restraint policy. It is also important because the Social Democrats' leadership on the 90th anniversary is trying to present themselves as "the party of the February matches". But those who fought and died in the bloody February days were opponents of the Social Democratic Party leadership line.

  A loud manifestation marched through Vienna on the afternoon of February 12, the 90th anniversary of the heroic uprising of February in 1934. Karl-Marx-Hof, a central scene of the resistance at that time, became a place of memory of all those Combatters that, deservedly, are described as heroes.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e89ba92ff675ad1cab01e52cea5a2f8a">
  Exactly 90 years ago, a flamethrower threw in Karl-Marx-Hof when the Austrian fascist army used it in the houses of the workers. Thousands rose in February against Austrian fascism in many parts of Austria with weapons in their hands. Despite the military defeat, these battles were decisive for the future development of the struggle for resistance against Austrian fascism, and then against Nazi occupation. The manifestation for the anniversary was fierce: banners, songs, marches and pyrotechnics denoted that the lesson of these struggles are still relevant 90 years later.

  The common slogan of the demonstration was "to remember is fight." This was also expressed in the songs and in the content of the demonstration, the CUL was directly against the current dismantling of democratic and social rights, as well as the increase in prohibition policies. The slogans against inflation and theft of salary with appeal against reaming, against NATO and for the defense of Austrian neutrality. The Palestinian flags could also be seen, as a symbolic expression of international solidarity and friendship between peoples, but also against censorship and the "mentality of justice" of the ruling classes against Palestinian solidarity.

  The red block was a great position in the demonstration, which played an important role in the beginning of the songs. This particular block emphasized the importance of the Austria Communist Party (KPö), now the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPö). This is also important because on this 90th anniversary, the leader of the Social Democrats is trying to be present as the "February uprising party." However, those who fought and died on the bloody days of February were opposed to the line of the Social Democratic Party.

  The fierce atmosphere of the demonstration showed that the participants did not expect the rulers to "come into reason" today. On the contrary, the slogan "the February uprising has already shown it - fight for the revolution!" It spread throughout the manifestation. Today, we should not be nostalgic, but - as the important parts of the demonstration showed - we must apply the lessons of these struggles!

  The crisis of bourgeois democracy mentioned by

  </em>
  It is one of the direct results of the relative overproduction crisis of imperialism. Fascism and the tendency to reacting - extended through the mouth of an organ of the imperialist monopoly of communications - cannot prevent the main tendency of revolutions worldwide.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e315467e2d1123f85f3bce7e03992103">
  A recent survey of
  <em>
   Economist Intelligence
  </em>
  , the magazine's data research sector
  <em>
   The Economist
  </em>
  He showed that less than 8% of the entire world population lives in what they classify as "full democracy." This form of government only exists, according to the investigation, in 24 countries. On the other hand, 39.9% live under an “authoritarian regime”, in force in 59 countries. There is no doubt about the imperialist criteria to classify what is "democratic" and what is not. However, what emerges from research is the expression of an era in which it is not possible to hide the development of the political crisis in the time we live - whose base is the decomposition of the world imperialist system.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-61efc4ba9c816962c1db4eedfddb1995">
  The data is as follows: 37.6% of the world's population lives under a “failed democracy” regime, existing in 50 countries (29.9% of existing countries). Another 15.2% of the population, inhabitants of 34 countries (20.4%), lives under the so -called "hybrid regime." The current results mentioned in the survey are the result of an increase in the "democratic crisis": in the last edition, 39.6% of the world's population lived in an "authoritarian regime", 0.3% less than the Current figure.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6b457f7dd995eed4d08af4086abbbe19">
  The symptoms of a political crisis cannot be taken in isolation. Politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. And the crisis of bourgeois democracy mentioned by The
  <em>
   Economist
  </em>
  It is one of the direct results of the relative overproduction crisis of imperialism. The most recent expressions of this economic crisis are the real estate crisis in China, which mainly affects giants such as
  <em>
   Egregre
  </em>
  , and bank bankruptcies in the United States, which damaged names such as
  <em>
   Silicon Valley Bank
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Silvergate

  y
  <em>
   Signature Bank

  .

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a9525d246984cb09ca962c4aa17d3a84">
  In addition, prior to the survey
  <em>
   de Economist Intelligence
  </em>
  , an Oxfam report found that the concentration of income into the world has increased. In the United States, throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, inflation rates crushed the achievements of popular masses in an economic catastrophe. From 2020 until now, 791 million workers have had to live with a lower salary than inflation.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-1671383e2e0bad45e1ebc191d27b8123">
  Hence the political consequences perceived year after year. Knowing that the unresolved crisis of its regime tends to awaken and increasingly powerful uprisings between popular masses - as is happening incessantly in recent years -, the ruling classes resort to repression as the only alternative. In the last two years countries such as France or the United Kingdom have used or advanced measures and bills to restrict rights as basic as strikes and popular street manifestations. Throughout Europe, militarization advances at a rapid pace: in addition to the increase in the military budget, organizations such as NATO welcomed Finland as a new member in 2023.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a4c99e490d9f975524d74c3a8892e2f7">
  These are traces of a sick organism with a terminal condition. It is a fact that the world lives in a new period of revolutions. The open popular struggles, as in Palestine or in Latin American countries, Southeast Asia or even Europe, are indications of this, followed next to the growing explosiveness of the masses expressed in popular demonstrations and surveys that do not stop shuddering, From the United States, Europe and then China, the entire world. The highlight of the current moment is precisely the transcendental and historical operation of Al-Aqsa-the tactical offensive of the Palestinian national resistance-which demonstrates very clearly that it is possible that popular forces defeat the world imperialist system. Imperialism has already given the alarm about the possibilities of victories of popular organizations. Fascism and the tendency to react - revealed by the mouth of an organ of the imperialist communications monopoly - cannot stop this main trend.

   The government has decided for the former Ilva the extraordinary administration with the support of confederal and USB trade union organizations.
  </b>
  Even the unions, as at the beginning Palombella of Uilm, who said no to the AS, today everyone is satisfied, because it was sent away by the Mittal government and the notorious Morselli. In fact, the idea has been propagated that if governance and management change the management of this factory, the problems are solved. It is a profound illusion.
  <br>
  While it is not clear - or you can understand very well - what it means from the point of view of the workers of the steel and contract.

<p>
<b>
   In all these months of Roman meetings, no working platform has been placed on the table, no concrete claims to defend workers:
  </b>
  from the minimum of wage integration to the cassintegration (millions to the masters and not even hundreds of euros to the workers); at the resumption of work both in the contract and for all in steel mill; from the blocking of layoffs; the commitment to the industrial area remediation of workers for more than 5 years in CIG in AS; to the single metalworking contract and permanently for everyone in the contract; For 25 years they have been enough to retire, on returning to the duties/asbestos law; to the reduction of working hours to the same pay in steelurgery
 </p>
<p>
  We consider the
  <b>
   Extraordinary administration a remedy worse than evil.
  </b>

<p>
  We would be happy to be wrong

  The workers, starting from the contract, returned en masse to work; If the permanent layoffs to steelworks ended, which sometimes works for a few days a month; if the Ilva workers in AS returned to the factory; if the environmentalization of plants and productive activities had an accelerated; if the steel workers can work safely and their respectful rights; If the single contract of metalworkers protected by a social clause for all and all contracts were transformed indefinitely, and respected at all, respected in the If the polluting effects in the city had a brake and a decisive turnaround and seriously and really started the reclamation plan, etc.
 </p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<u style="font-weight: bold;">
   But the Slai Cobas for the class union does not think this will happen.
   <br>

  Instead, we think that we will have more permanent layoffs; that there will be no return to the work of
  <span>

  workers of many companies of the contract; that there will be redundancies/layoffs in the near future of workers of both the contract and of steel mills (with numbers of thousands of workers already announced, beyond the post as of the government); that you will worsen the wage/ work/ contractual conditions; That by environmentalization, reclamation, decarbonisation, well that goes, years and years will pass.

   We think that only the autonomous and unitary struggle for prolonged and general of the steelworks/ contract/ workers Cigs in Ilva as they should and can defend the class interests of workers

  <b>
   another line and another union direction to be built in the fire of the struggle is required,

   Excerpt from art. of the Corriere di Taranto - Gianmario Leone
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  (yesterday) "... by decree of the Minister of Business and Made in Italy Adolfo Urso, steel mills of Italy S.p.A. was admitted, with immediate effect, to the procedure
  <b>
   Extraordinary administration.
  </b>
  And the choice on the first extraordinary commissioner (they will probably be three as in the past) has fallen on dr. Giancarlo Quaranta, who boasts in his curriculum a forty -year experience in the steel sector. And who has crossed the whole history of Tarantino steel: first as an Etlsider employee starting from January 1984, and then started holding a series of top roles of the Riva group, and then be appointed on July 2, 2014 by the former Commissioner Ilva Piero Gnudi, CEO (Chief Operations Officer, in practice an operational director), of Ilva. Arriving at today where he is currently the director of the technical and operational division of Ilva in extraordinary administration. The government has therefore chosen to go on the safe side, relying on a person who perfectly knows the entire Ilva system in all its aspects and who enjoys the utmost esteem of the Ilva commissioners with which he has been working for years, of trade union organizations, as well as of Confindustria Taranto and the firms of the surface present in the AIGI Association.
 </p>
<p>
  The government is studying two to three amendments to the former ILVA. The changes concern two themes: the need to connect the 2015 extraordinary administration of the ILVA relating to the ownership of the plants with that on the steelworks of Italy that manages them. The other aspect concerns the induced: for the strengthening of the resources allocated, to evaluate the practicability on the use of the administration surplus of the Region. The DL, which must be converted into law by March 18.
 </p>
<p>
  (in) An official note of the multinational one reads that "with the extraordinary administration the involvement of ArcelongoTal in steelworks of Italy ends, which began in 2018.
 </p>
<p>
  However, all the knots that now will have to try to dissolve are unresolved. Starting with the serious liquidity crisis in which the company is facing (since even if the 320 million euros were immediately made available to the new commissioner, which has been talked about for months, the latter would evapize in a few weeks), passing through the Management of the plants and their maintenance, passing through the credits boasted by suppliers and dozens of companies of the survey and by the automotive and ease: there is the present and the future of thousands of workers at stake.
 </p>
<p>
  Finally, it should not be forgotten that the procedure for the renewal of the integrated environmental authorization is underway which will inevitably mark the possible production future of the former Ilva (both in the maximum quantity that will hardly exceed 6 million tons per year, with relative employment downsizing , which in the production process that will inevitably see the implementation of the same with the use of electric ovens). This means that beyond the announcements and promises, you can hardly put hands on an industrial plan worthy of the name, but above all it will take a long time to ban a new international tender procedure to entrust the management of the plants.

  The following article analyses the Munich Security Conference and the attitude of the German bourgeoisie in the context of the imperialist preparations for World War III. It was published in the Maoist newspaper Özgür Gelecek (https://ozgurgelecek51.net) in Turkey. Unofficial translation.]

  The German imperialist bourgeoisie is feverishly preparing for war. The initiator of the 1st and 2nd imperialist wars, German imperialism is working intensively to become the central base and wage the 3rd World War.
21 February 2024

The Western bourgeoisie, especially the political and military spokespersons of the German imperialist monopolies, sleep with war and wake up with war. Especially since Russia's attack on Ukraine, all their efforts have been to shape the economy according to the war, while arms production has become one of their urgent tasks to prepare the military power for a new imperialist war.
On 16-18 February 2024, the 60th Munich Security Conference (MGK) will be held in Munich, Germany. They are organising a conference where imperialist bandits, arms monopolies will talk about bargaining, preparing for war, how to maximise arms production and military power, and how to plan domestic fascistisation by destroying democratic rights and freedoms.
Of course, the negotiations for the protection of the interests of all imperialist bandit representatives, their own countries and monopolies will be made at the highest level. The war lobby of all imperialist countries will be at this conference. In short, besides the fact that the NSC is one of the places where the imperialist monopolies negotiate to share the world, this year's conference is likely to be even more contentious and in an environment where threats are thrown because it is held in an environment where polarisation is sharpening.
This conference coincided with the start of NATO's five-month-long exercise called "Unshakable Defence", in which about 90,000 troops from 31 NATO members and the candidate country Sweden will participate. It is obvious that this exercise is a preparatory and offensive exercise against Russia. Germany will again be the military base of this exercise for five months.
In addition to being the economic motor power of Europe, Germany also wants to be the military motor power and is preparing accordingly. The Chancellor Scholz, the Minister of Defence, the Chief of the General Staff, the Minister of the Interior, the Chairman of the National Security Council, all of them are talking about preparing for war and shaping the economy for war. This is not enough, they also want society to be shaped according to the war. While Germany is preparing its economy and society for the imperialist war, it is preparing the EU countries for the war in the same way.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wants to send more weapons to Ukraine. He proposes turning the EU economy into a war economy. He emphasises that this is urgent. And he adds that it would be useful for Europe to be ready for a conflict with Russia, "possibly lasting decades".
"We have to get used to the idea that there could be a threat of war in Europe, and that means we have to be ready for war," said German Defence Minister Pistorius.
Germany's Chief of the General Staff, Carsten Breuer, also told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the German Army "should be ready for war" within five years, "This does not mean that there will be a war, but it is a possibility."
The prime ministers of

</a>
 Germany, Denmark and Poland, who attended the opening of the new ammunition production factory of the imperialist Rheinmetall monopoly, which profited the most from the Ukraine-Russia war (it is more realistic to say NATO-Russia war) and increased its capital many times over, gave messages that arms production in Europe should be increased rapidly. This shows that the German economy is being redesigned according to the war.
The German imperialist bourgeoisie is feverishly preparing for war. The initiator of the 1st and 2nd imperialist wars, German imperialism is working intensively to become the central base and wage the 3rd World War.
Poland has signed a 'military Schengen' agreement with Germany and the Netherlands.[1]
"The Weimar Triangle was held at Saint-Cloud near Paris with the participation of French, German and Polish leaders."[2]
The European bourgeoisie has long been looking for ways to act independently of the USA. The preparations for imperialist war play a facilitating role for new imperialist unions or blocs (sub-blocs). Nevertheless, for the time being the EU bourgeoisie is aware that it cannot act independently of the USA. However, it continues to increase its economic and military power based on Germany.
With this awareness, the German bourgeoisie is trying to further increase its own influence and dominance in the EU and wants to assume the role of the military and economic saviour of the EU and to bring the EU countries under its wing with the discourse of "Russian threats".
While the German bourgeoisie is preparing for a new imperialist war, while militarising its economy, it is of course taking domestic fascisation along with it. While continuing to polarise society on the basis of xenophobia, it does not hesitate to enact fascist and anti-democratic laws.
Some of the monopolies, together with the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), are preparing the fascist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as the future government. The reason for the CDU's involvement is that they know that if the AfD alone were to come to power there would be a strong reaction. They are trying to familiarise society with the fascist party.
Nevertheless, the anti-fascist anger of the masses is great. In the last month, more than 4 million people took part in anti-fascist mass demonstrations in 500 cities in Germany. Anti-fascist demonstrations and rallies are still going on. However, the liberal war-ready government is trying to pacify and deflect these demonstrations.
The German bourgeoisie is once again appearing on the scene as an imperialist war-making force. History does not repeat itself, but due to the character of imperialism, the biggest imperialist countries are never left behind in the war for world domination or for a larger share of the markets. The fact that they suffered heavy defeats in previous wars does not mean that they have learnt the right lessons. The imperialist bourgeoisie can never avoid imperialist aggression and war in the war for hegemony. Even if the possible war will bring greater destruction than the previous ones. Although German imperialism was the initiator of the 1st and 2nd imperialist wars, it will not hesitate to start the 3rd one. Its present preparations are accordingly.
Imperialist wars can be prevented. This can only be possible if all anti-fascist, anti-imperialist war forces, especially the working class, strengthen their unity and raise their struggle.
On the one hand, the German bourgeoisie polarises society on the basis of hostility to immigrants, on the other hand they know that they cannot do without immigrants. This is because capitalism is unable to produce a labour force. Nevertheless, the bourgeoisie is trying to polarise and divide the working class through xenophobia and prolong the life of their bloody power.
In fact, all these indicators show that the imperialist system has come to an end and they will not see another century. Because the accumulation and centralisation of capital and the increase in impoverishment and the consequent destruction of democratic rights and freedoms are directly linked to each other.
Here communists have a historic task: Communists must lead the masses against imperialist war and fascism and, accordingly, pursue tactics to unite all anti-imperialist anti-war and anti-fascist forces.
In addition to this, the real liberation of the masses will come through socialism and the perspective of socialism must be presented. The working class and oppressed peoples are not pessimistic. We must not forget that imperialist wars lead to socialism. The working class has nothing to lose but its chains. But it has a huge world to gain.

    GENEVA
 (19 February 2024) – UN experts* today expressed alarm over credible 
allegations of egregious human rights violations to which Palestinian 
women and girls continue to be subjected in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank.
   </p>
<p>
    Palestinian women and girls have reportedly been arbitrarily
 executed in Gaza, often together with family members, including their 
children, according to information received. “We are shocked by reports 
of the deliberate targeting and extrajudicial killing of Palestinian 
women and children in places where they sought refuge, or while fleeing.
 Some of them were reportedly holding white pieces of cloth when they 
were killed by the Israeli army or affiliated forces,” the experts said.
   </p>
<p>
    The
 experts expressed serious concern about the arbitrary detention of 
hundreds of Palestinian women and girls, including human rights 
defenders, journalists and humanitarian workers, in Gaza and the West 
Bank since 7 October. Many have reportedly been subjected to inhuman and
 degrading treatment, denied menstruation pads, food and medicine, and 
severely beaten. On at least one occasion, Palestinian women detained in
 Gaza were allegedly kept in a cage in the rain and cold, without food.
   </p>
<p>
    “We
 are particularly distressed by reports that Palestinian women and girls
 in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual 
assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army 
officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly 
raped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual 
violence,” the experts said. They also noted that photos of female 
detainees in degrading circumstances were also reportedly taken by the 
Israeli army and uploaded online.
   </p>
<p>
    The experts expressed concern 
that an unknown number of Palestinian women and children, including 
girls, have reportedly gone missing after contact with the Israeli army 
in Gaza. “There are disturbing reports of at least one female infant 
forcibly transferred by the Israeli army into Israel, and of children 
being separated from their parents, whose whereabouts remain unknown,” 
they said.
   </p>
<p>
    “We remind the Government of Israel of its obligation 
to uphold the right to life, safety, health, and dignity of Palestinian 
women and girls and to ensure that no one is subjected to violence, 
torture, ill-treatment or degrading treatment, including sexual 
violence,” the experts said.
   </p>
<p>
    They called for an independent, 
impartial, prompt, thorough and effective investigation into the 
allegations and for Israel to cooperate with such investigations.
   </p>
<p>
    “Taken
 together, these alleged acts may constitute grave violations of 
international human rights and humanitarian law, and amount to serious 
crimes under international criminal law that could be prosecuted under 
the Rome Statute,” the experts said. “Those responsible for these 
apparent crimes must be held accountable and victims and their families 
are entitled to full redress and justice,” they added.

  The issue of the Gaza gas field returned to the spotlight following 
the legal notice sent by the American law firm Foley Hoag - on behalf of
 Palestinian human rights organizations - to the Italian company “Eni” 
and international and Israeli energy companies.

<p>
</p>
<p>
  The Palestinian Gaza Marine field is one of the oldest gas fields 
discovered in the eastern Mediterranean region, and it is seen as a 
promising opportunity for the Palestinians who suffer from a scarcity of
 energy resources, amid their suffering from the Israeli occupation.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Despite the discovery of the Gaza offshore field 
since 2000, its resources, which are estimated at more than one trillion
 cubic feet of natural gas - which far exceeds the needs of the 
Palestinian people - are still locked in the ground and have not been 
exploited commercially until now due to Israel’s obstruction of all 
efforts aimed at establishing an independent energy infrastructure. For 
the Palestinians, it is also trying to seize these resources to export 
them through deals with neighboring countries with the participation of 
European Union member states.

<h2>

</p>
<p>
   Warning
  </p>
<p>
</p>
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  At the beginning of this month, the issue of the 
Gaza gas field returned to the spotlight following the legal notice sent
 by the American law firm Foley Hoag - on behalf of Palestinian human 
rights organizations - to the Italian energy giant Eni and other 
international and Israeli energy companies.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The office warned it not to proceed with exploration
 activities in the Gaza offshore well, which is owned by the Palestinian
 people, in accordance with the provisions of the 1982 United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which the State of Palestine signed in
 2019.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  This warning comes after Israel announced last 
October 29 that it had granted a license to the Italian energy company 
to operate in the Gaza field, which Palestinian human rights 
organizations considered a violation of international law.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Director of the Center for International Legal 
Studies, Fabio Marcelli, said in an interview with Al Jazeera Net that 
Eni's contract with Israel constitutes a violation of international law,
 which prohibits the occupying authority from disposing of the natural 
resources found in the lands it occupies, including the adjacent marine 
areas.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Marcelli warned that the company's mere initiation 
of exploration activities to exploit resources belonging to the 
Palestinians would make it a partner of the State of Israel, which is 
now burdened with accurate and documented accusations of committing 
genocide before the International Court of Justice.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The same spokesman pointed out that "Eni's 
complicity" - which is considered a public company - in such crimes will
 extend to the government of Georgia Meloni, which is working to supply 
Israel with part of the weapons it uses to carry out genocide in the 
Gaza Strip.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  For its part, Eni explained - in an exclusive 
statement to Al Jazeera Net - that it "obtained - along with other 
companies - exploration licenses based on an international tender, and 
that licenses related to the exploration activities expected in October 
2023 were granted."
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The company confirmed that "no agreement in 
particular has yet to be signed, and that it currently has no activity 
in the region, and that wherever it operates, it is keen to ensure that 
its activities are consistent with international law and best safety 
practices."
 </p>

<p>

</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  With the continuation of the Israeli aggression on 
Gaza, the matter has become embarrassing, not only for Eni, but also for
 the Italian government itself, which is the largest shareholder in the 
company by 32%.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  This was evident in the responses of Italian Foreign
 Minister Antonio Tayani - last Wednesday - during the parliamentary 
questioning when he tried to evade the government's responsibility in 
this case, stressing that the company located in the entire 
Mediterranean region is listed on the stock exchange and operates 
according to market rules.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Tayani tried to downplay the importance of the 
agreement, referring to Eni’s confirmation that the contract is still 
under preparation, and that there are no ongoing exploration operations 
yet in the area in question.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  He also tried to reduce the pressure exerted on the 
Italian company, pointing out the importance of reconciling economic 
interests with the legitimate aspirations of peoples, and stressing the 
necessity of defining borders and maritime areas in accordance with 
rules dictated by international law.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The government official added, "We are facing an 
issue of conflict of interest, and the best solution is the path of 
mediation, dialogue, and finding solutions through negotiation, similar 
to the agreement reached by Lebanon and Israel in October 2022 regarding
 the demarcation of their maritime borders."
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera Net, 
Angelo Bonelli, the official spokesman for Green Europe and 
representative of the Green and Left Alliance, denounced Tayani's 
statements, describing them as unacceptable.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Bonelli - who interrogated the Foreign Minister in 
Parliament regarding the issue - confirmed that Israel - in accordance 
with Article 55 of the Hague Treaty - does not have the right to use 
Palestinian natural resources to achieve its own economic gains.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  He said, "We know very well that the energy issue is
 very important to our country, but there are also lofty morals and 
values ​​that lead us to say that at a time when more than 30,000 
Palestinian civilians are being killed today, there are those who are 
trying to steal their resources to achieve their own profits."
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  In response to Al Jazeera Net's question about what 
initiatives he intends to take during the coming period, the Italian MP 
revealed his party's intention to plead before the European Court of 
Justice against the company "Eni" in an international case.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Discreetly
  </p>
<p>
</p>
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  For his part, journalist Alberto Negri - in an 
interview with Al Jazeera Net - described Tayani's statements as 
"ridiculous", and that they were "a desperate attempt to climb onto a 
sheet of glass."
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  He said that the minister's talk about the absence 
of any activities yet to exploit Palestinian natural resources is due to
 the fact that the exploration phase has not begun and must be 
completed.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Negri explained to Al Jazeera Net, "Eni has 
certainly not spoken in the past, nor even the Italian government, about
 concluding an agreement with Israel to exploit the Gaza gas field. Had 
it not been for the warning that reached the company in the past few 
days, this incident would have remained hidden from Italian public 
opinion."
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  He explained the attempt by Eni and the Italian 
government to conceal the agreement by saying that the war and the 
Israeli massacres against the Palestinians had already begun, and 
therefore they had to announce their suspension as a minimum.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Negri added, "Our Foreign Minister's talk about 
conflicts of interest and preferring the path of mediation and dialogue 
in such cases is nothing but a speck of dust in the eyes, because Eni 
did not negotiate with the Palestinians, but only with the Israeli 
government, even though the Gaza Marine field was discovered a year 
ago." 2000, and the Palestinians have not been able to extract gas from 
it until now due to the severe blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza 
Strip since 2007.”

<p>
   "A ghost travels Europe: the ghost of communism ...", thus began writing Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels one of the most transcendental and decisive texts for the history of mankind:
   <em>
    The communist manifesto
   </em>
   , published on February 21 as today, in 1848.
  </p>
<p>
   The industrialization process of Europe in the nineteenth century and then worldwide, consolidated capitalism as the economic system, and therefore of power, dominant and hegemonic throughout the planet, based on the private property of the means of production, whose source of wealth is the wage exploitation of the workers. In this context and the monopolization of the international market, that is, with the conversion of capitalism into an imperialist system, the
   <em>
    World working class
   </em>
   It was homogenized as long as the workers of the entire planet were exploited by the same system, and therefore, a tool that served to break with that system of oppression was necessary. Under those conditions and with a incredible philosophical and anthropological base, Marx and Engels wrote a manifesto that collected the most immediate and viable analysis and slogans for the proletarian struggle, a communist manifesto that in the hands of the workers became a lethal weapon for the bourgeoisie.
  </p>
<p>
   The Imperialist First World War (1914-1918) generated, together with another series of events, an environment conducive to the emergence of communist parties throughout Europe, the strongest and most successful in its struggle was the Bolshevik Party of Russia, which after years after years of an intense struggle of workers and peasants against the Tsarist power would violate the power in a cold October 1917, and this would lay a historical precedent that would serve as a reference for the
   <em>
    World working class
   </em>
   in the fight for its emancipation. Revolutionary movements were unleashed worldwide, before the Imperialist Second World War, the Spanish revolutionary movement in which the Spanish communists would deliver their lives would deliver fascism, fascism that would be definitively defeated in 1945 while a red flag with the Hoz and the hammer, the flag of communism stood in the center of Berlin.
  </p>
<p>
   In the context of the postwar period, another very important process inspired by the
   <em>
    Communist Manifesto
   </em>
   : The Chinese revolution, which under the direction of the Communist Party and the great leader Mao Tse-Tung would reach invaluable achievements for Chinese workers, his greatest contribution to the international communist movement was the great proletarian cultural revolution.
  </p>
<p>
   In the Cold War the
   <em>
    Communist Manifesto
   </em>
   He struck revolutionary movements worldwide, from Eastern Asia to the Caribbean Sea, from Eastern Europe to the South American Cone, from the African colonies to the nascent Republics of the Middle East, and from the fall of the Soviet Union there would be many more, to Our days, now inspired by the most effective ideological ideological that was based on the communist manifesto: Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. India, the Philippines, Nepal, Peru, Turkey, among many other countries have revolutionary processes that have the manifesto at hand, since their contribution to the ideology of our class is incalculable.

<p>
   Today more than ever, if we really want a real change in our society, we must return to this type of texts, study the proposals that Marx and Engels have read us for decades and raise awareness about our most immediate reality, because by Something is that the bourgeoisie fears this communist ghost, because he knows that the undeniable struggle inspired by the manifesto and communist ideology in general is really powerful and can have the strength to end his domain of poverty and exploitation.
  </p>
<p>
   The Manifesto and other texts written by revolutionaries from all countries today give us tools to organize and fight effectively against the bourgeoisie and capitalism that sustains it in power, because as the same manifesto ends,
   <em>
    The ruling class can tremble at a communist revolution, workers have nothing to lose in it, more than their chains, instead have an entire world to win ...
   </em>
</p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">
   Workers from all countries, join!
   <br>
   LONG LIVE COMMUNISM!

   Today he resumes the march of the Indian farmers towards the new capital Delhi. In recent days they had stopped in the suburbs of Delhi waiting for a response from the government, but the answer has not arrived, indeed, the government led by the Hindu fascist ways continues to support multinationals, bringing to ruin the farmers and agricultural productions.

   Even today, but already in the previous days, right at the beginning of the "Delhi Chalo" march (let's go to Delhi), the peasants on trucks and cart loads of food, bed linen and other supplies, they had clashed with the police, after that the negotiations with the government have not been able to bring to a commitment to the minimum prices guaranteed for a series of crops. The authorities have adopted rigid security measures in the neighboring areas with New Delhi. Hundreds of police officers in anti -isposa seal have been deployed between concrete blocks surmounted by barbed wire and containers destined to block the convoy. The security forces stopped the farmers on the Shamchu border, which separates Punjab and Haryana - the northern states to which most farmers belongs - almost 200 km from their destination. The demonstrators launched stones and tried to break down the barricades, the police and the paramilitary forces have used tear gas and water cannons. The security forces also used drones to launch tear gas candlelines on farmers who, in response, launched Kite in the sky in the hope of harnessing drones. Several farmers unions said they would protest against the police action by blocking railway traffic in various Punjab locations for four hours on Thursday.

<p class="MsoNormal">
  And, in the middle of the protest of the current farmers, the Communist Party of India (Maoista) has extended its support to the protesters located currently along the border between Punjab and Haryana.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  According to a copy of the press release issued by the Maoist party, the Maoists extended their support for the appeal for a block day given by the unions of the farmers on Friday 16 February.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  Through the press release, the Maoist Party said that the national government is favorable to multinationals and is dealing with farmers as the enemies of the state. In addition, making an appeal to the masses because they give their support to the aforementioned protest, the Maoists in the press release said that the government continued to ban the entry of the farmers on the border of the Village of Shamchu.

<p class="MsoNormal">
  The press release also stated that all the requests of farmers are legitimate, but the government is not willing to satisfy them.

    From the 22nd of January to 31st of May the largest NATO exercise in 36 years, since the end of the so-called “cold war”, takes place. 90,000 soldiers from 32 States take part in it. The maneuver “Steadfast Defender 2024” is part of a series of “Steadfast Defender”, of which the exercise of this year is expected to be the most extensive.

    What is named as “Steadfast Defender” is in reality not a “defense exercise”, but a part of the militarization and “making the NATO- and EU-countries ready for war”. The “Steadfast Defender 2024 is about exercising for a military confrontation with Russia, as NATO tests among others moving troops to eastern Europe and the exercise takes place mostly on the eastern flank of NATO, from Norway to Romania. The last NATO exercise comparable in dimension was the maneuver “Reforger” in 1988 with 125,000 soldiers. With the “Steadfast Defender 2024” “defense against a Russian attack” is supposedly simulated. The key word “defense” is often heard in connection to the current armament, see the Sky Shield Initiative, and is used to justify above all the high armament of the imperialist countries.

    In an attempt of the USA to maintain its hegemonic position, the so-called “alliance partners” of the USA in Europe should be made ready for war through military alliances, such as for example NATO. How concrete the preparation for war is, is already shown in the amount of soldiers taking part: when it was 9,000 “exercising” soldiers in “Steadfast Defender 2021”, now it is 90,000 from 32 States. As in the NATO-maneuver “Defender-Europe-20” which was canceled during the Corona-pandemic, in the first phase the shipping of US-troops will be trained and then in the second phase the moving of the troops. Thus the “exercise” of NATO for a military confrontation with Russia did not begin with the attack of Russia against Ukraine. This fact shows also that this is not just about “defense”.

    According to official information, “a conflict with Russia and terrorist groups is being prepared for”. The Netherlandish admiral and chair of the NATO military committee says that “peace is no longer self-evident and in the two next decades an extensive war with Russia has to be expected in the next two decades”, and therefore “we need to be prepared that they attack us”. The Norwegian head of armed forces Eirik Kristoffersen emphasizes here that “the time is up” and there is “a time frame of one, two, maybe three years” in which it must be invested massively to defense.

    Also the EU is intensifying the armament and the preparation for war. The further construction and intensifying of the “Permanent Structured Cooperation) as well as with the “EU-reaction force” should make also the EU-member States fir for war and match them to NATO-standards. Also the ruling class of Austria has accepted this new reaction force, which is completely against the neutrality.

    With the maneuver “Quadriga 2024”, which will be carried out by the German Bundeswehr, the alarming, movement of troops and the commando will be trained. This exercise is for the defense of the eastern flank of NATO, in which Germany acts as a pivot point for the defense of Europe. In the maneuver “Grand South” which will take place between 26.04.2024 and 18.05.2024, the troops of the Bundeswehr will be moved to Hungary and Romania. Looking back to the earlier movement of troops, it can be expected that also in this exercise troops will be moved through Austria.

    On the side of the dismantling of social and democratic rights, the dismantling of social services at the same time with the massive increasing of investment into militarization and armament is preparation for war which is totally clear organized against the peoples. The current large maneuver serves preparation for war of the imperialists, war which has the slaughtering of the peoples as a consequence. The history has shown and also the present moment proves that the peoples need to oppose the increasing plans of armament and war of the ruling classes. In Austria it means among other things the strong defense of the neutrality, which means to struggle for the application of the demand for the re-application of neutrality.

 How much is the 
 life of a worker?
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How much are the 
 Lives of 5 workers?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How much are the 
 lives of hundreds of workers who only died in these first months 
 of the new year?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nothing, for i 
 Masters are worth nothing.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One of the masters 
 who used the dead, injured migrants who risked their lives 
 At the Florence construction site, he also refused to respond not only 
 To the questions of journalists but anticipated the line that masters, 
 large and smallques, they have on this umpteenth massacre.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This gigantic 
 Florence construction site of the Esselunga contract was actually a jungle 
 of the contracts and subcontracts to the maximum reduction. It is clear that in 
 This chain the workers are the last ring, the victims 
 sacrificial, exploited, poorly paid and moreover killed if the accident, 
 Always on the horizon in this system, it takes place.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The responsibles 
 they are not difficult to identify, even in the pages of the newspapers 
 they find themselves: first of all the Caprotti family of Esselunga who 
 Just in these days you were cars promoting with books with which 
 He car incens him. A family that made great 
 profits and these profits made them on the skin of the workers, 
 of the workers, not only the direct ones who work in Esselunga, the 
 whose conditions have been under attention several times, but on the whole 
 Chain that leads to the situation and the massacre of Florence.

  The workers - of 
 One of them the body was found only after many days - you don't 
 They didn't even know who they were. These deaths are a piece of reality 
 very large in the working class, of the more working class 
 exploited that it is made up of many immigrants without residence permits 
 And in black.

  These workers 
 They came from the Bergamo area, Brescia, they made long trips for

 Work. It is not well known even where they stayed in the 
 week of work before returning to their country.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two of them is 
 sure they didn't even have the residence permit that placed them 
 in conditions of having to accept any job to bring bread 
 At home. The family and those who know them tell that a part of theirs 
 Money went to Morocco to the same family members who still remained there.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  While I am 
 Romanians the 3 seriously injured workers who are still in the hospital and for 
 one of them has not yet been dissolved the prognosis while we 
 let's talk.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How much is the 
 life of these workers? How much the wealth produced by them is worth 
 their work? It is worth a lot for the master, large, medium -sized masters and 
 small, of the exploitation chain.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is true for us 
 Much more the life of these workers than all this system.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 evident that there will be no justice for these dead workers 
 As with the many dead workers if we do not fight to abolish the 
 system that kills, the capitalist system, the system based on 
 profit. Because behind these deaths there is, at the end of everything, 
 exploitation and profit, i.e. the readings of the social system in 
 we live, that workers pay on jobs also with the 
 life.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But dying is alone 
 a part of the gigantic war that is conducted against i 
 workers, a war made of hundreds, thousands of accidents, of 
 occupational diseases, made by everything that is created in the 
 daily life by the workers, from their families.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The new code 
 of the contracts. Everyone today discover the new contract code, the "waterfall contracts". The last stage of the wild use of contracts 
 and subcontracting that is not certain of these days, nor certainly this 
 construction site began with this government. The governments that have it 
 preceded - both technical and center -left and on the long journey 
 backwards of the long Christian Democrat governments, etc., the whole cycle of 
 governments - If you look at governments in all these years, you can see that 
 they continually produced the same result: workers' massacres, 
 deaths at work, massacres of all kinds, railway, in cisterns, 
 In the plants for explosions and fires, a chain of massacres it has 
 Given to the usual litany. In this usual litany nothing is 
 really changed, indeed if it has changed it has changed for the worse.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These deaths are 
 fault of all governments and all this system, this must be said 
 clear. It is not the last government that killed them. Of course, the last 
 government has contributed significantly to their death, 
 to the execution of these workers, because an execution in this 
 War for profit is the one that took place in this construction site.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 the last step, first of all wanted by Salvini and supported - given the 
 same class matrix and the same conception - from Meloni and from 
 All the rulers and ministers of this government is valid for 
 All construction sites. Imagine what presents itself with the big ones 
 Works, from the bridge over the Strait of Messina to the works for the G7 of 
 Puglia, etc. etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this chain 
 Summer is the non -exceptional rule. In this chain death 
 It is announced, the end is known and therefore is any hypocritical 
 Sometimes denounces made by the newspapers and by everyone when it happens. AND 
 hypocritical, because everyone knows very well that this system must be defended 
 And kept alive because it is their system. And this system 
 It produces chain, "cascade", dead at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 This involves the maximum reduction, the competition of competition that leads to transforming the place of 
 I work in a tomb, in a cemetery.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this contract 
 The figures vary. There are 64 companies, some with contracts 
 fictitious. The 5 dead workers were over the third level of subcontracting. 
 To save on wages, the workers were not framed in 
 construction contract - not that the building contract has saved who knows who knows 
 which lives, it is clear, when the unions raise their voices: “Not 
 they were with the construction contract ", because, those who have the contract 
 Are Edile protected? They are not dead, they are not part of the audience of 
 dead at work? do not reach the first places among the dead on the 
 Work? - were paid as metalworkers, drivers, cranes and 
 etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No contract 
 It is really applied, but the contracts that have been signed are 
 all were contracts to lose, be clear. The chain of contracts 
 national in recent years has turned into a chain of 
 worsening precisely on work performance, security, for 
 do not talk about objectively reduced wages, because no 
 contract recovered neither inflation nor the cost of the increase 
 productivity and so on. Low wages, contracts 
 insufficient are for the whole working class. The inhalation is 
 A constant certainly facilitated by the subcontracting chain.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the chain of 
 subcontracting is not the exception, it is the logical consequence of the system 
 of the contracts, is the logical consequence of the contracts that do not 
 protect, it is the logical consequence of the general system that there 
 promotes.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Companies are 
 Like vampires, it never enough for him. And therefore the 
 their thirst for profits exacerbated by the competition, by the economic crisis 
 which feeds this competition, causes the obligations of 
 safety, workers' training fail.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the 
 training of workers, but what training if the conditions of 
 work are out of control in the sense that they do not protect and are not 
 based on the protection of the primacy of workers' life? But 
 Certainly also on this ground we have always gone worse. Not 
 Only the laws are insufficient, but the laws are largely 
 inapplicated and not from now, always and more and more, as you are that yes 
 The collective force of workers is weakened, the existence of a 
 union that would protect working conditions daily. 
 Without the union that protect the conditions of 
 work, without a rigid daily battle for the application 
 of the laws, it is clear that security is truly entrusted to the 
 luck the life of workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the life of 
 workers is - precisely for the very fact of being workers of 
 A capitalist system - it is bad luck, it is the tragedy of 
 tragedies of a system founded on man's exploitation 
 on man.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How not to try 
 Indignation for the things that Minister Calderone says? a hateful 
 person, the head of labor consultants, the fox guard 
 of the chicken coop, whose sole purpose is clearly to encourage the classic 
 category of the servants of the master: the work consultants are used a 
 Erlude labor laws. Think about putting them to do the ministers who 
 What they will do if not to build a system based on the elimination of 
 laws at work, going against all those laces and laces that i 
 masters do not want for the free exploitation of the workforce that 
 produces the infernal chain that translates into the death of 
 workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister of 
 I went there and had the tough face to say that he has 
 increased work inspectors when everyone knows that 
 Labor inspectors in most realities have disappeared. 
 Their powers, however not extended, have been reduced. 
 The action of the notorious Minister Sacconi of the Berlusconi government is 
 was always to transform inspectors into consultants of 
 companies and goodwill, the good arrangement of many inspectors, certainly does not fulfill the work inspectorates that they have transformed 
 In all this, so much so that inspectors and inspectors of 
 work that have been in the past that have retired 
 they are remembered while currently who can remember the 
 Labor inspectors?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The fact 
 Today's newspaper holds that not 
 There had been no inspection for this huge construction site, that is 
 A huge construction site that is almost as much as a neighborhood, so much so 
 it is true that the collapse of this construction site has alarmed everyone 
 And he could cause death not only of those who worked but also of those who lived there, including children who went to school, etc. etc. Well, 
 how not to demand that where there are the large construction sites or in the 
 industrial areas, in the large industrial areas of contracts, does not 
 Is it a permanent station of the inspectors?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Not that these 
 stations can save who knows which lives, but they certainly have 
 a minimum of deterrence effect. Inspective stations on places must be provided 
 of work how the construction sites open, the large construction sites and yes 
 equip all the structures to hold the large construction sites, a permanent workstation of the work inspectors, 
 Clearly assisted by Ausl and everything you need. Why not 
 There is no relationship between large dimensions of construction sites, area 
 industrial, tide of contractors and the inspectorate of 
 work and the so -called control bodies.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So evident how ridiculous all the measures that are neither more nor less than 
 tax exemptions like the prizes to the masters if the worker does not die.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So we came to the point that not to make workers die 
 A prize, a tax exemption or bonus or other. Exactly the 
 Nelly, shouldn't the norm be? No, another amnesty, for di 
 more estimate, contributory discounts and penalties in exchange for the 
 promise to get in order.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Throughout 2023 
 1485 were the deaths at work. Only on February 16 15 
 workers died at work. Since the beginning of the year 194 died, 
 of which 148 materially in the workplace and 46 ongoing.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This chain now 
 It is practically legalized by this government. "Legalized": this 
 Which was sanctioned now is legalized, condoned. The great words 
 Here they should not serve, a body -to -hand battle is needed and one 
 organized structure on jobs. This structure today does not 
 there is, this structure is to be built, this structure deserves the 
 change of the trade union organization and the methods and forms of 
 struggle against the deaths at work itself.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now the mother of 
 All of all the laws is the residence permit for all 
 migrant workers because this makes it the most blackmail and 
 therefore more exposed to deaths at work. So it's not just 
 on the laws to contain the deaths at the work you can act, but 
 on all the laws that produce that condition: contracts to 
 maximum reduction, "cascade", the types of contacts there are, the 
 system of controls that is certainly seen by the masters as a 
 discomfort, something to avoid. How many tricks are when there are i 
 Check? Whoever has really made inspection activities know 
 Very well. How the inspector arrives the owners try to hide 
 Everything that can be sanctioned with sometimes almost tragicomic effects.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This government is 
 Responsible, the masters are responsible for these deaths. It is not 
 it is true that they are tragic fatality nor much less that they depend on 
 "Pilone not put well": it is clear that in a condition of 
 This genre any error, any non -conducted operation 
 Well, it can be translated into death, the massacre.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Put i 
 workers safe in the workplace means putting them to 
 Error test.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This kind of 
 war that the masters lead, the system, the governments, this 
 Government, requires an adequate response to the class war. War 
 class in work, class war on the territory, 
 General class war.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Finally, two 
 words. How much is the life of the workers worth? 2 hours of strikes!
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 Landini's ridiculous trombonate and servility even in front of the 
 death of the proletarians, of the workers of Luigi Sbarra, the secretary 
 of the CISL now secretary of the government, who did not want to do 
 Not even the 2 hours of strike, if the large trade union organizations 
 they consider this the cost, of what can be done in the face of 
 dead, massacres, obviously this is the ring on which it will need to 
 intervene.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, you have to 
 intervene. Through the alternative trade union organizations, 
 certainly better than the official ones, but certainly with the 
 construction of a daily and prolonged conflict, part of the 
 General conflict.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Needless to say 
 What happens in the matter of the after-bridge: the processes, the 
 Investigations, acquittals, ridiculous penalties. About penalties 
 ridiculous, of course we have always been for the increase in penalties, in 
 This sense the request for introduction of a new crime should 
 find us agree, but we all know that everyone's experience 
 these years shows that it is not the increase in crimes that produces one 
 better security because everything is entrusted to governments, to 
 State, to the system that applies them and this system is the system of 
 Execution denied not the system of justice that does justice to the deaths at work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Certainly the 
 only positive results in these events were held not only 
 When family members, the work companions were on the piece, have 
 participated with human solidarity and support giving continuity 
 to the fight, to the war in the workplace to remove the causes that 
 They had produced death, with participation in the processes. These are 
 certainly not the "solution" but forms of struggle necessary for 
 Building the material strength that can lead to a solution.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is clear that 
 From all our speech it descends inevitable that the only one 
 Solution is the revolution.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And, please, you don't tell us that they are 
 words, don't tell us "Yes, but who does it?" and so on. This type 
 of speech established as a commonplace, common sense, in the files 
 of workers and popular masses, contributed to the death of 
 These workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This yes, yes 
 can say loudly: even if you all consider yourself acquitted, you are 
 all involved. Because the revolution is the only solution.

   Bourgeois democracy crisis recorded by Economist is one of the direct results of the relative overproduction crisis of imperialism. Fascism and the tendency to reactionary - wide open through the mouth of an organ of the imperialist communication monopoly - cannot prevent the main tendency of revolutions around the world.

   A recent research from the
   <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">
    Economist Intelligence
   </em>
   , magazine data research sector
   <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">
    The Economist
   </em>
   He pointed out that less than 8% of the entire world population lives in what they classify as "full democracy." This form of government exists only, according to the survey, in 24 countries. On the other hand, 39.9% live under an “authoritarian regime”, vigorous in 59 countries. There is no doubt about the imperialist criteria for the classification of what is “democratic” and what is not. However, what is extracted from research is the expression of a time when it is not possible to hide the development of the political crisis at the time we live - whose basis is the decomposition of the world imperialist system.

<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
   The data follow: 37.6% of the world's population lives under a “failed democracy” regime in 50 countries (29.9% of existing countries). Another 15.2% of the population, inhabitants of 34 countries (20.4%), live under the so -called “hybrid regime”. The current results recorded in the research are the result of an increase in the “democratic crisis”: in the last edition, 39.6% of the world population lived in an “authoritarian regime”, 0.3% below the current number.

   Symptoms of political crisis cannot be taken in isolation. Politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. And the bourgeois democracy crisis recorded by
   <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">
    Economist
   </em>
   It is one of the direct results of the relative overproduction crisis of imperialism. The most recent expressions of such an economic crisis are the real estate crisis in China, mainly affecting giants such as
   <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">
    Egregre

   , and bankruptcy of banks in the USA, which streamlines names such as the

   Also, before the research of the
   <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">
    Economist Intelligence
   </em>
   , an Oxfam report found that the concentration of income in the world has increased. In the USA, throughout Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, inflation rates crushed the popular mass gains in an economic hecatomb. Since 2020, 791 million workers had to live with a salary below inflation.
  </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
   Hence the political reflexes perceived year after year. Knowing that the crisis without solution of its regime tends to awaken increasing and increasingly powerful uprisings of popular masses - as has occurred incessantly in recent years - the ruling classes give use to repression as the only alternative. Only in the last two years, countries like France or the United Kingdom used or advanced with measures and bills to restrict as basic rights as the strike and popular street demonstrations. Throughout Europe, militarization advances at strides: In addition to increasing the military budget, organizations such as NATO received Finland as new members in 2023.

<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
   They are traces of a sick organism with a terminal frame. It is a fact given that the world lives in a new period of revolutions. The open popular struggle, such as Palestine or Latin American, Southeast Asia or even Europe countries, are evidence of it, followed side by side of the growing explosiveness of the masses expressed in the manifestations and popular uprisings that do not stop the shudder, from USA, to Europe and go to China, the whole world. The highlight of the current moment is precisely in the transcendental and historical operation of Al-AQSA-the tactical offensive of Palestinian National Resistance-which is quite clearly demonstrating that it is possible for popular forces to overcome the world imperialist system. Imperialism has already lit the alert in the face of possibilities for victories of popular organizations. Fascism and the tendency to reactionary - wide open through the mouth of an organ of the imperialist communication monopoly - will not be able to prevent this main trend.

<p>
  Last Monday, the 19th, a group of school bus drivers paralyzed their vehicles and started a joint work to plug the main road holes in the Capão Comprido Rural Center, São Sebastião region, in the Federal District.
 </p>
<p>
  In video, you can see the drivers, together with the local residents, covering the roads with soil, stone, paddles and hoes. The solidarity action was motivated by the bad qualities of the road, which have been causing the jam of school buses.
 </p>
<p>
  Drivers are part of the School Caminho Program, a project created by the Federal Government to allegedly ensure the access of resident students in rural areas to public schools of basic education. However, despite the purchase of vehicles, the quality of the road follows terrible, damaging or even preventing the arrival of students in the schools.
 </p>
<p>
  Even with the various complaints made to the São Sebastião Regional Administration, the government has done nothing to solve the problem of this road, which has long been in poor condition, full of holes, mud and dust, which makes it difficult for buses to pass through and put at risk the safety of students and drivers.

  In an interview with the São Sebastião Notícias portal, one of the drivers reported that they are “tired of jamming on this road, having to push the buses, seeing the children suffering from the balance [of the vehicles] and dust. We have asked the São Sebastião Regional Administration several times to pack this road, but they do nothing. So we decided to take action and do the service they should do. ”

  New mass concentration,
 </b>
 Analogous to the previous one, took place today in front of the central gate of the CERTH Research Center in Thessaloniki. The center, which absorbs large funds and is considered a "technological hub" (with visits by the Prime Minister), has recently fired about 15 workers (under the pretext of "non -finding project"). In fact, some are clearly revengeful, as the redundant workers were union workers.

      The vast majority of the center workers are working with DPY. ("Block")
     </b>
     , with what this entails: short -term contracts, not permissions (normal, sick and childbirth), not fixed hours and paid overtime, no dismissal compensation. Based on the "block" the administration of the Center masquerades with the misleading title "Finishing Contract". The need to claim permanent and stable work, more than obvious.

     And after the first mobilization, the SETIP, SMT-M unions and you were invited to a joint meeting held at the EKTH, with a significant turnout, and decided to have a new rally. An alien impression has caused the attitude of the "Workers' Association", which behaved as a genuine employer. More or less shook the finger to the workers and refused to call on mobilization! It is no coincidence, then, that the administration referred the 3 unions to ... SEEKETA (!) For the performance of their resolutions. Employees have eyes and see who is on their side and who with the employer ...

   But, the contradiction of 
 true farmers - the agrarian workers and the peasants - against their 
 exploiters, although relegated in the media by the agrarian crisis, 
 develops and is an objective fact, that the increase in the price of the products 
 food clashes against the mass of consumer of the countryside and the city, the 
 majority of which are the workers; as is also a fact that 
 taxes that the EU allocates to agricultural subsidies for large 
 monopolists are part of the surplusval that capitalists extract from the 
 Exploitation of the proletariat and this encourages contradictions. The 
 agricultural subsidies and EU prices policy favors landowners 
 capitalists and major capitalists in the imperialist countries of the EU and 
 to the semi -feudal landowners and great bourgeoisie in the semicolonial countries 
 inside the EU. Claims for subsidies and agricultural prices go to 
 against the proletariat.

  The Program 115 of
  <strong>
   By the way
  </strong>
  It dealt with the planning of the Zionist State of Israel, still in progress, to invade the city of Rafah, Palestinian region of the southern Gaza Strip. In the program, the city's invasion plan prepared by the Sionan Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's War Cabinet is compared to the “final solution to the Jewish question”, prepared by the Nazi state in the early 1940s.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, a program also dealt with the military actions of the Palestinian National Resistance, Israeli crimes, USA veto to the proposal of ceasefire prepared by Algeria in the UN Security Council and diplomatic friction between Brazil and the State of Israel .
 </p>
<p>
  The national section was devoted, in addition to coverage of the friction with Israel, to news of the indigenous resumption in Viamão, Porto Alegre, and the brutal police slaughter committed by the PM of Paraná Shock Battalion in Londrina. Check out the program below.

The demonstration on the anniversary was largely combative: transparent, flags, slogans, march and pyrotechnics ensured that the topicality of the teachings of this struggle was demonstrated 90 years later.

      The common motto of the manifestation was "Remember means 
 struggle". This was also expressed in the songs and the content of the 
 manifestation, which were directed against the current dismantling of the 
 democracy and social welfare, as well as against the growing policy of 
 prohibitions. The slogans against price increase and wage theft 
 They alternated with appeal against rearme, against NATO and for the 
 Defense of Austrian neutrality. Palestinian flags were also exhibited, 
 as a symbolic expression of international solidarity and friendship between 
 peoples, but also against the censorship and mentality of the rulers in 
 Relationship with Palestinian solidarity.

      What caught attention was a red block in the 
 manifestation, which largely triggered the songs. This block 
 especially the importance of the then revolutionary kpö (PCA), which 
 opposed the moderation policy of the Social Democratic Party of the 
 Workers (Sdapö), the current Spö. This is also important because in this 
 90th anniversary The direction of the Social Democrats tries to present itself as 
 the "February Party". However, those who fought and died 
 On the bloody days of February they went against the direction line 
 of the Social Democratic Party.

      What was striking was a red block on the demonstration, which has a significant impact on the speech choirs. This block particularly emphasized the importance of the then revolutionary KPÖ, which stood against the retirement policy of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAPÖ), today's SPÖ. This is also important in this respect, since on this 90th anniversary the leadership team of social democracy tries to stage itself as the "party of February fights". However, those who fought and died in the bloody days of February, however, stood against the line of social democratic party leadership.

<p>
  The State Government of Bahia published last January 27 Ordinance No. 190/2024 which determines the “mass approval” in the state school system. The measure, edited while education professionals were on “collective holidays”, provides for “continuing progression” with “successive advances without interruption in the year/series”. According to the Bahia Department of Education (SEC), the project would have a “partial progression regime” for failed students who pass to the next grade, teaching online classes, “specific notebooks” and “study plans” to regulate them "Pendencies" from the previous year. According to teachers, the ordinance is an attempt to mask the rates of education and the crisis in the state school system.
 </p>
<p>
  In 2023, the Higher Education Census revealed that Bahia was the state with the lowest proportion of high school -based students who enrolled for the National High School Exam. Meanwhile, in 2022, the school census pointed to the trend of increasing disapproval rates after returning to face -to -face classes: the rate of high school abandonment in the public network was 6.5%, higher since 2019, while the rate Approval fell to 85.1%.
 </p>
<p>
  The Basic Education Development Index (IDEB), which combines approval rates with the Portuguese and Mathematics Proof of the Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB), also revealed that in 2022 high school in the state network of Bahia has Fourth worst grade in the general index and the penultimate placement in Portuguese and Mathematics Learning. In addition, throughout Brazil, education goes bad. Currently, the dropout rate in the country reaches half a million young people. In the three years of high school range from 8.8%, 8.3%and 4.6%, depending on the year.
 </p>
<p>
  In this serious framework of public education, measures such as the newly approved by the Bahian state government are nothing more than palliative. With “democratic” appearances by trying to reduce failure rates in schools, the most practical effect of the measure is to make the precarious training of public schools, without even touching the most basic problems of education in the country.
 </p>
<p>
  A recent study by IPEC points out that 48% of students who do not attend school is due to the need to work to help with accounts at home and inability to reconcile studies with work. Another effect known on young people is the lack of perspective in the face of the future, driven by the advancement of the crisis in the country. While not solving any of these central problems, the government seeks to manipulate data with palliative measures.
 </p>
<p>
  Earlier this year, the federal government was in the same direction by launching the “Pé de Meia” program. The measure seeks to offer a value of R $ 200 per month to the student, as well as a savings at the end of high school, if students maintain the minimum approval rate. A bonus can be granted to those who take the Enem test, regardless of whether or not approved (ie, it doesn't matter the entry of these students to the university, and the priority is the increase in college entrance exams).
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-de-meia-maquiagem-de-luiz-inacio-para-um-governo-fracassado-na-educacao/">
   Calculations have also shown that the $ 200 are unable to improve the lives of these students
  </a>
  , which will continue to work to help at home and thus not maintain the minimum frequency rate in school.

     This is a true genocide, which takes as an excuse the actions of the Palestinian resistance of October 7 but that continues the infamous dispossession and apartheid of 75 years ago, and thus it is being considered increasingly more internationally.

     The Popular Unity considers the heroic and sacrificed struggle of the Palestinian people for its self -determination and national and social liberation as a fair struggle, which must receive the greatest solidarity of our people, since it faces the Zionist State that is a military power and is strongly supported politically, economically and militarily by Yankee imperialism and its European allies.

  The high commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights has published a press release in which yes
  <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/israelopt-un-experts-appalled-reported-human-rights-violations-against">
   report
  </a>
  The serious concerns of the United Nations experts regarding alarming reports and complaints of serious violations of human rights against Palestinian women and girls in the Gaza and West Bank Strip, including sexual and rape violence.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the information received by the experts, women and girls Palestinians would have been subjected to rapes, sexual violence, and arbitrary executions, often together with their family members, including children, within the Gaza Strip. The experts expressed shocks for the relationships that indicate deliberate attacks and extrajudicial killings of Palestinian women and children, some of whom, according to what reported, kept pieces of white fabric in his hand while they were killed by the Israeli army or by the affiliated.
 </p>
<p>
  United Nations experts highlighted the arbitrary possession of hundreds of Palestinian women and girls since 7 October, including defenders of human rights, journalists and humanitarian operators. According to reports, many prisoners have undergone inhuman and degrading treatments, including the refusal of basic necessities (such as absorbent, food and medicines) as well as serious beatings. Cases of sexual violence have been reported, including cases of rape, with prisoners presumably subjected to searches by male officers of the Israeli army and threatened with further sexual violence.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, there is disturbing news of Palestinian women and children, including babies, who disappeared after contact with the Israeli army, some of whom are transferred by force to Israel. Experts have asked for an in -depth and impartial investigation by underlining that these acts would constitute serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, potentially equivalent to crimes pursuable pursuant to international criminal law.
 </p>
<p>
  "The managers must be held responsible", underlined the experts, "and the victims and their families deserve full repair and justice". United Nations experts also urged an immediate action to face these atrocities and guarantee the protection of Palestinian women and girls in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank.

  There are scholars, such as historian Oscar Conde, who report that Lunfardo, contrary to what the bourgeoisie often says, was more than a significant manner of “criminals” that emerged between the 1800s and 1900s in Argentina, and that remains alive.

  The incomprehensible and maradona
 </h4>
<p>
  Colloquially, it is called lump.
 </p>
<p>
  In practical terms it is unintelligible even to Spanish average speakers from other countries. "El Pibe de Oro", nicknamed by Maradona, belongs to the lunfa and means "The Pivete (boy) of gold."
 </p>
<p>
  The proletarian language also includes, among others, a particular way of speaking by reversing the syllables of a word, called “Vesre”, the opposite of “setback (otherwise” in Castilian). So you have
  <em>
   tango
  </em>
  replaced for
  <em>
   gotan
  </em>
  ,
  <em>

  </em>
  by
  <em>

<p>
<em>

  by
  <em>

<p>
  Lunfardo had a great influence on Brazilian slang, notably in the ports of Praça Mauá (

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  A rebellion and a game
 </h4>
<p>
  So Oscar Conde clarified in an interview of 2018:
 </p>
<p>
  “Lunfardo is a unique linguistic phenomenon.
 </p>
<p>
  For a term to be Lunfardo has to be present an idea of rebellion and an idea of 'playing/playing' with language.
 </p>
<p>
  When Lunfardo comes, it does it almost like a
  <em>
   socioleto
  </em>
  of the popular classes. That is, it is a speech of the mouth of the poor, the disqualified, the inhabitants of the tenement/favela, the suburb.
 </p>
<p>
  Originally it was a speech of these popular classes, where there was a lot of immigrant. I would say, however, that in the 1940s Lunfardo is already a polyclassist and crosses all ages. Currently, a person who started using Lunfardo when he was 10 years old, today is 60 and continues to speak him. ”
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  A little of the word
 </h4>
<p>
  Following are some terms practiced in the lunfa:
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
    Bacán
   </em>
</strong>
  (similar to cool, in Brazil) -
 </p>
<p>
  The one who has money in a bank (
  <em>
   bank
  </em>
  In Castilian, therefore “Bancana” person). Individual looking rich or having good life.
 </p>
<p>
  Related to this, we would have the word "bacchanal", being "bacán" an apocope. Thus, "Bacán" would be the person given to good life, travel, designer clothes, etc.
 </p>
<p>
  However, for some, the etymology would proceed from Italy, the old genoese language, from the jabra now unused "baccan" with the meaning of boss, owner of the house/farm, owner or chief of ship that as a sign of command was carrying a staff called " Bacco ”(something like“ staff ”in Portuguese).
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
    Cana –
   </em>
</strong>
  Police. Such a Lunfarda word seems to be the abbreviation of “Canary”, a word already used in Spain since the 1500s at least (Miguel de Cervantes, author of the classic “Don Quixote de La Mancha”, mentions it with the meaning of
  <em>
   cantor
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Police whistleblower or confidant).
  </em>
  Others assume that etymologia is on the French Palha
  <em>
   cane
  </em>
  ("Sugarcane", "stick"), alluding to the club used by police.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
    Gato –
   </em>
</strong>
  This word is one of the demonstrations of the "sliding" of
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/significado" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   meaning
  </a>
  that exists in Lunfardo, given in part by changes of historical contexts.Ex: Until Early 1980
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  It used to be a compliment to someone very agile or shrewd (the musician
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Astor_Piazzolla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Astor Piazzolla
  </a>
  For his great talent when playing Bandoneón, the main instrument in the tango, was nicknamed “El Gato”). However, there were times when it was common to call
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  customers of the most beautiful and luxurious/expensive harlots, as well as the prostitutes themselves, called
  <em>
   toga
  </em>
  In Vesre.
 </p>
<p>
  Sliding again, among the poor class
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  He then became adjective to qualify the stupid foolish person. However, in provinces of the Argentine interior, as
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=provincia_de_Santiago_del_Estero&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Santiago del Estero or Tucuman
  </a>
<em>
   gato
  </em>
  It applies to thieves because they have “easy nail to steal”. In Brazil it is similar.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
    Mina –
   </em>

  But in fact it is also a showcase of the Made in Italy armaments and one 
 mission to protect fossil sources. Aspides, mission that will last 
 At least a year, it is a deal for the Italian war industry e 
 It contributes to the spasmodic race towards global rearmament. Scope 
 unofficial of the mission is also to provide Israel
  <strong>
   "A coverage behind the Huthi attacks"

  and to protect the ships that bring military or economic aid to i 
  Ports of Tel Aviv. Finally, the perspective is also that “to give one

  According to Federpetroli in the Red Sea and in particular
  <strong>
   From the Suez canal, 27 percent of the Italian Raish Importo passes and 34 percent of liquefied natural gas.

  This is why the Aspides mission is to be understood as yet another 
 reinforced intervention to protect fossil sources in transit towards

<p>
  Widespread hysteria: This is the appropriate name to qualify the shouting of the world reactionary press in condemnation of Luiz Inacio's speech in the capital of Ethiopia, in which he qualified as genocide Israel's actions in Gaza and compared them with the Holocaust. Following the intelligence services of the Zionist State of Israel, all sorts of "intellectuals," articulates and anchors have gone out to resonate again that every comparison of Israel with Nazism is "modern anti -Semitism." Meanwhile, the Palestinian people continue to resist massive bombings that, added since October 7, are equivalent to more than five Hiroshima bombs (!)-Made that Hitler, although certainly wishing it, could not do and be proud. In fact, perhaps it is really “inappropriate” the comparison with Hitler: perhaps the Zionists have already surpassed him.
 </p>
<p>
  It is not too much, either, to reject the unjust accusations of Zionists to Luiz Inacio: this is not an enemy of Zionism, as all his interventions prove, in which he conceives the order of events: first, Hamas promoted terrorism and we must condemn ; Then Israel was disproportionate and is practicing genocide. Between this position of Luiz Inácio and that of Joe Biden (unsuspecting advocate of the Zionist genocide against the Palestinian people) there is only a difference in undergraduate, or rather in choosing the word “genocide” and “holocaust”, because the logic of reasoning is The same and the implications as well: Israel has a "right to defend itself" (read, to pursue its colonial project) and Hamas, is a terrorist and should be condemned (read, armed, anti-chronential resistance, of the Palestinian people). According to this logic, it all started on October 7 - the fateful day of the great and heroic operation of Hamas - because before, perhaps, the Palestinians lived the paradise on Earth, there was no
  <em>
   apartheid
  </em>
  in the region and nor died civilians in the Gaza Strip. If Luiz Inácio is really a party to the thesis that a genocide is underway, and Israel resembles Nazi Germany, why don't we break diplomatic relations? Would it be acceptable, “for a humanist” (as you like to say), maintaining Hitler relations in the midst of holocaust?
 </p>
<p>
  The symptoms and shaking of the crisis are also in internal politics. The unit within
  <em>
   establishment
  </em>
  To inhibit the institutional break trend within the barracks, by advancing some houses in investigations against Bolsonaro, he gave Alexandre de Moraes in the present survey and in the operation of the PF. From now on, unity begins its tendency to disaggregation: on the one hand, the Supreme Court, who is in charge of this work, has its own ambitions to stretch its part in political power and cover its functions, which has a strong legislature in the legislature resistance; Project of the bill aimed at submitting, in practice, the Supreme Court to the Federal Senate, the latter having the function of ratifying Supreme Court decisions. On the other hand, the High Command of the Armed Forces, which has at the heart of its ideology the conviction that national integrity depends on its timely intervention in political crises since the Empire, although it is defensive so as not to associate with demoralized pockets,, It will return to the ground earlier than you think: taking advantage of the demoralization of the Supreme Court and the Legislature, it only awaits an important crisis that erodes the legitimacy of the government-an inevitable fact, when it comes to a reactionary, opportunistic and class reconciliation government . Generals know that, from time to time, the popular revolutionary movement rises in the country, restoring the historical flags of the democratic struggle of the Brazilian people, and that there is no other option to try to bathe it in blood: in short, from time to Times, military intervention is necessary, and they believe that the time is coming.
 </p>
<p>
  Contrary to what people with constitutional illusions think, the severe and very serious contradictions that resulted in the October 2022 military crisis have not been solved: they have been latent. Only popular masses can face the tendency, aggravated every day, to curtail the rights of the people and civilizing freedoms, a trend that occurs on the basis of the real class struggle; Only popular and revolutionary movements can gain immediate economic and political victories for the people and pave the construction of a new Brazil.

  Everywhere, you notice the shouting of the swords' sketches the salary of the Zionist war counter -propaganda machine in Brazil. GloboNews journalist Guga Chacra said Luiz Inácio's lines - qualifying Israel's actions as genocide - are “anti -Semitic” demonstrations. The Israeli Confederation of Brazil (Conib) called Luiz Inacio's lines “wicked distortion of reality”. There are still others, who accuse the speech of the Brazilian agent of denying the Nazi Holocaust, of unintentionally in Israel's politics, and other aberrations.
 </p>
<p>
  Well, Luiz Inacio said nothing much. However, the point is that even this is unacceptable to the Zionist bandits: they only accept cowardly and inverted capitulation to their dictates, like blood -thirsty dogs. They are really similar to the "bitch of fascism, which is always in heat." And in this, they rely on their counter -propaganda in Brazil, through this "brown press", whose war coverage is more Zionist than that made by the Israeli press itself.
 </p>
<p>
  As for mr. Luiz Inácio, who demonstrates some practical consistency with his speech and
  <strong>
   Roma
  </strong>
  Relationships immediately with Israel! Not only by recent episodes, regarding the Palestinian Holocaust - reason more than sufficient - but for the constant interference of Israel's diplomatic structures on Brazilian internal policy, such as the successive statements of Conib and its asclas, and also the Israeli ambassador himself himself , which made election campaign in 2022 for Bolsonaro and the far right, in direct confrontation with everything that respects national sovereignty; And also from the systematic espionage of Brazilians, as is proved with the appearance of milicos contracts headed by Heleno with the company Cognite, which not only offered araponging technology, but stored
  <strong>
   in Israel
  </strong>
  The data collected here, in a case of national betrayal that would blush Joaquim Silvério dos Reis.
 </p>
<p>
  But Luiz Inácio won't do that. Its nod on foreign policy - even shy, because in its pronouncements always recognizes Israel's right to defend itself against “Hamas Terrorism” - seeks to cover its total delivery, in the internal level, the large bourgeoisie and the large local bourgeoisie and to imperialism. This is an old trick, which Lula has not invented: he is just copying the one used and abused by Jânio Quadros. Finally, the country's agent wanted to give the far-right stage on the inner plane, to politically revive Bolsonaro, to stay in the land as the “least worst”

     As we have already denounced, our comrade Salvador Pinal Meléndez, a member of the Zapotec community of Santa Cruz Tagolaba and a member of our organization, was arrested on September 21, 2021 for crimes that he did not commit and is currently under house arrest due to his sensitive state of health , while his attackers continue to enjoy complete impunity and commit new attacks against the community.

     All of these comrades have the defense of the country and the fight against the impression of the CIIT together. All of these comrades and their communities are victims of the repression of the old state, which continues to escalate and leads to comrades, threatened, kidnapped, wounded and even murdered, as in the case of our comrades Luis Armando Fuentes Aquino, Jesús Manuel García Martínez and Félix Vicente Cruz. For all of these reasons, we claim that the interocean corridor sells and kills arms and indigenous people!

     As an organization, we confirm our solidarity with the persecuted, persecuted and political prisoners as well as with the communities and organizations that have decided to continue the fight against the enforcement of this imperialist mega project of expropriation and death. We continue to call on the unity of the democratic and revolutionary forces in our region to build a powerful movement that makes what we have already said: The actual is belonging to us! No to the imperialist mega projects.

  The high commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights has published a press release in which yes
  <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/israelopt-un-experts-appalled-reported-human-rights-violations-against">
   report
  </a>
  the 
  serious concerns of the United Nations experts regarding 
 alarming reports and complaints of serious violations of human rights 
 towards Palestinian women and girls in the Gaza Strip and in 
  The West Bank, including sexual violence and rape.
 </p>
<p>
  According to information received by experts, women and girls 
 Palestinians would have been subjected to rapes, sexual violence, and 
 arbitrary executions, often together with their family members, including the 
 children, inside the Gaza Strip. Experts expressed 
 Shock for the relationships that indicate deliberate attacks and killings 
 extrajudicial to Palestinian women and children, some of whom, 
 According to reports, they held pieces of white fabric in hand while 
 They were killed by the Israeli army or by the affiliated forces.
 </p>
<p>
  United Nations experts highlighted detention 
 arbitrary of hundreds of Palestinian women and girls from 7 October, 
 including defenders of human rights, journalists and humanitarian operators. 
 According to reports, many prisoners have undergone inhuman treatments 
  and degrading, including the refusal of basic necessities (such as 
 Absorbents, food and medicines) as well as serious beatings. Have been reported 
  cases of sexual violence, including cases of rape, with prisoners 
 presumably subjected to searches by male officers 
 of the Israeli army and threatened with further sexual violence.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, there is disturbing news of Palestinian women and children, 
 including babies, who disappeared after contact with the Israeli army, 
 Some of which are transferred by force to Israel. Experts have 
 requested an in -depth and impartial investigation by underlining that these 
 acts would constitute serious violations of international human rights e 
  of humanitarian law, potentially equivalent to crimes 
 persecutable in accordance with international criminal law.
 </p>
<p>
  "The managers must be held responsible", have 
 The experts underlined, “and the victims and their families deserve 
 full repair and justice ". United Nations experts have 
 also urged an immediate action to face these atrocities e 
  guarantee the protection of Palestinian women and girls in the 
 Strip of Gaza and in West Bank.

    The Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has long been fighting to the United States. On February 20 and 21, the London High Court will now check whether all appeals to its delivery have been exhausted in Great Britain or whether it may continue to be done. The now 52-year Assange has been sitting in the Belmarsh high security prison in London for almost five years. The US government accuses the Australian spy and wants to do the process for it. In the event of a conviction, Assange threatens up to 175 years in prison. The allegation of espionage is justified by the fact that Assange, together with Whistleblower Chelsea Manning, released secret material of US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and thus have put the life of US information in danger. However, this accusation could not be proven in the trial of manning, so the decision has already been made, emphasizes Assanges German lawyer Schomburg.

    Assange supporters have announced to go to the European Court of Human Rights in order to have the delivery exposed. Organizations, initiatives, journalist associations and protesters are committed to the release of Assange's worldwide. The hunt for journalists, who face various questions or aspects against the war trays and the aggressive course of the imperialists. An example is to be set up on Assange, because the publications on Wikileaks had a significant part in the fact that human rights violations, torture and abuse of prisoners and the killing of civilians came to the public in US war operations. For this, Assange should now pay ...

    Numerous vigils and demonstrations for the release of Julian Assange take place in numerous countries in Europe. On February 20, a vigil for the release of Julan Assange in Vienna was also organized. It is about the struggle for freedom of press and expression and the defense of the people's democratic rights. The case of Julian Assange clearly shows that the crocodile tears of the "West" when it comes to criticism of imperialist competitors in relation to democratic rights are pure lies. Because obviously it is not far with the "democratic rights" in the so -called "West". That is why it is important to defend freedom of press and expression and thus the release of Julian Assange.

  40 to 50,000 auctions are planned to take place in 2024. The popular house is targeted. They break doors at night and fly on the road workers, retirees, families. They grab the houses and give them to the fund's crows, arrest and persecute those who refuse to get out of their home. The government sends the clergy with the Public Prosecutors and the Police to implement its anti -populist policy.
 </p>
<p>
  In this difficult times for the people, the right of the popular housing needs to be a matter of the labor and popular movement.
 </p>
<p>
  With the notion that "housing is a universal right - mass struggles against evictions, auctions and expensive rents", organizations and collectives call on mobilization on Saturday, February 24, 11:00 am at the Toumba Cultural Center.
 </p>
<p>
  The announcement of the KO Thessaloniki of the KKE (M-L) here:
 </p>
<p>
<br>
</br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>
<span style="font-size: medium;">
    They grab houses - people fly on the street popular families.
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>
<span style="font-size: medium;">
    The people on the streets to resist!
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   They break doors at night and fly on the road workers, retirees, families. Grab the houses
  </b>
  And they give them to the funds of the funds, arrest and persecute those who refuse to get out of their home. The government sends the clergy with the Public Prosecutors and the Police to implement its anti -populist policy. The straps of the transfer of laws and judicial decisions and as bodies of the exercise of state violence. Anyone who cannot pay will face laws, judges and police.
 </p>
<p>
  The ND government and the bourgeoisie's political staff, no matter how they whine to protect the first home, use auctions, evictions and rental policy as tools to redistribute wealth, to serve their interests. Banks, the big contractors, the big owners. They are attacked with fury at the standard of living of workers and popular strata. With European Union guidelines they have made an entire legal arsenal, set up crows, seizes mobile and real estate of the wakes, they are hammering the houses of popular families, even if it is the first or even the only home.
 </p>
<p>
  The problem was exacerbated during the Memorandums, when the attack on popular labor incomes intensified with the excuse of the crisis and debt.
  <b>
   When dramatic wages and pensions declined, which reduced employees' incomes, unemployment was raised,
  </b>
  Along with the abolition of rights in education, health and any other conquest. Thousands of popular families were then found unable to pay the loan installments they took to buy a home. But then the system was not ready to go through the seizures and auctions, because the people were still on the road. Today they feel that they can implement their anti -populist policy.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   The ND government today, SYRIZA yesterday and all governments over time
  </b>
  They faithfully serve this policy: "All in Capital", all in the imperialist lenders, bankers and vultures of "investment schemes", falling on the popular-labor.
  <b>
   Popular housing rapture is part of this policy
  </b>
  And next time it will intensify and accelerate. It is a term in the reform plan for the government to receive the recovery fund funds and will be constantly monitored, as the Commission points out. This policy of poverty, poverty, unemployment, dependence on US and EU imperialists can only apply it with the suppression and intensity of terrorism. That is why fascism of political and social life is increasingly intensified and more often, repressive forces attack labor, student and social struggles.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   In this difficult times for the people,
  </b>
  threatening his life of poverty, losing his homes with concise procedures,
  <b>
   The right of the popular housing needs to be really a matter of the labor and popular movement.
  </b>
  With mass struggles to fight for the abolition of laws that rob popular property and for increases in wages and pensions.
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   The solidarity of the people to express it in every way.
  </b>
  In order not to get any popular house on the hammer, not to find any popular family. To make the slogan conscience and act, the "people save the people" and not the assignment of aspiring "saviors".
  <b>
   The mass popular organized struggles will bolt and cancel the government's plans.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>
<b>
    Down the hands of the popular home!
   </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>
    To live, we have to organize!
   </b>
</li>
</ul>

   Lali gathers many of the things that Milei hates and systematically attacks: she is a young woman, a popular and feminist artist who criticizes him openly for his anti -democratic and antipopular policies. Choose her as an enemy, just as her international friends have done Trump (against Taylor Swift) or Bolsonaro (against Pablo Vittar), for example.
  </p>
<p>
   He attacks her looking to justify her brutal adjustment and blame him for the miseries that the people live and that he deepens every minute: Lali "Deposit" charged several governments. So the question is, are you willing to finance those expenses against the VAT that takes the food to the Chaco boys? He said with total Milei cynicism in an "interview" in LN+.
  </p>
<p>
   He attacks her aggressively seeking to discipline the youth rebellion that is opposed every day, as she was perceived in the Cosquín Rock, where artists like her and Dillom gave a clear message against the government: Lali dedicated her songs to the "Antipatria" and those who say she "lives from the State." Dillom, on the other hand, sang the song “Mr. Collection ”from the hands of Filippi (popularized by the Bersuit) with a change in a verse:“ I move here, I move there. To Caputo, in the square, they have to kill him. ” Both artists were acclaimed by the present public.
  </p>
<p>
   A month earlier, the Racing stadium had already vibrated in the four recitals of the rang to the song of: “And already sees it, and already sees it. He who does not jump, voted to Milei. ”
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    There's no money?
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   For Milei the State does not have to spend money on cultural events. Neither in health, nor in public education. Nor in food to popular dining rooms, medications and increases in retirement. Not to mention guaranteeing accessible transport and subsidies to services for the most impoverished sectors. So what does the State have to spend? For him, in the payment of illegitimate debts such as the IMF, in subsidies to related entrepreneurs such as Galperín (Mercado Libre), Caputo (Mirgor Group), Hoffman (BGH) and Cherñajovsky (Newsan) and other monopolies, banks and landowners that we They remove 4.9% of GDP (according to the 2023 Budget Law, this is the value of everything that is not collected due to the exemptions granted).
  </p>
<p>
   His attempt to eliminate the National Arts Fund, the Theater Law, the National Institute of Music, the INCAA, with the defeated Bus Law and the DNU shows their interest in collapsing national policies in culture. This goes in tune with its plans of an ultra cupayo country model, without control of its resources, without national companies, without its own currency and cultural policy.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Indiscipline
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   But once again, although the "lion" is strong, it shows weakness: the broad solidarity and popular support to Lali did not wait with hundreds of messages of references of the national culture by banning it and defending freedom of expression .
  </p>
<p>
   It is not only an act of support towards her as an artist, but also a firm rejection of the attempts of censorship and repression that threaten even more democratic freedoms.
  </p>
<p>
   But, as it has been demonstrated in the streets of the country, this town does not shrink before the adjustment roars of the vessels that today have power and, without a doubt, they will lose it.
  </p>
<h5>
   Forgive me but I am so, / I don't know why / I know there are others too / that someone must be, / that prefer the rebellion to live suffering.

   The permanent attacks of the Government of Milei and its henchmen who question their policy of emptying and refinancing of public and private cultural institutions of long experience and international recognition, and to whom they criticize government ignorance about the functioning and cultural management cause discouragement, uneasiness , fear and anger.

<p>
   His fierce offensive against Lali Espósito has no limits. While that of "La Operara" and her vice denounce that the young singer is hired with "the state", shut up and hide that the municipality of Mar del Plata pays 50 million pesos for a couple of emissions of "the Legrand and her granddaughter ”, in that city. Thus riding a media show in the networks hide the underlying problem: the destruction of the country.
  </p>
<p>
   Many are the artists, actors, filmmakers, scientists, researchers who are concerned about the present and future of our culture and education and critic Risk hundreds of thousands of jobs in different areas in each of the provinces.
  </p>
<p>
   Thus they have manifested from Peteco Carabajal, Dillom, divided, Babasónicos, Molotov and many others.
  </p>
<p>
   Our culture expresses the identity and feeling deeper of our people and has a long history sown by various ethnic and aesthetic contributions.
  </p>
<p>
   When with maneuvers of this type it is tried to discipline and submit to the people, “from the foot” is mobilized, from the deepest support and reaction against these authoritarian and impoverishing forms that through the control of the State want to impose a vision and vision and A course contrary to national interests.
  </p>
<p>
   In all provinces, in each cultural, scientific, sports event, in the neighborhood assemblies and in each corner the pronouncements of repudiation and struggle of our culture that do not surrender grow.

   Impossible to analyze the mistakes made in that period [1973] without taking into account the errors of leftist opportunism encouraged by international and national conditions. But the problem of ours at that time was not to lift those slogans, because until a few days before the elections of March 1973 the country was booked to the edge of the rupture of the electoral process and a possible output of the insurrectional type, or coup followed by Insurrectional bursts. Our problem was, in any case, not having done what Mao recommends before each battle the ninety -nine possibilities about one hundred of being defeated and preparing for them while we strongly raised the way to succeed. We were not able to articulate, along with our revolutionary exit proposal, an adaptation to the electoral path that had already been imposed.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   There are those who say "we were wrong, we should have participated in the elections." I agree that we should have prepared for the electoral exit, but one thing is this and another to abandon the slogan of a triumphant Argentina replacing it with an electoral slogan. The struggle for a revolutionary mouth of the process that had begun with the establishment of the dictatorship in 1966 is a correct struggle.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   Now, due to inexperience-it can also be said, due to sufficient mastery of Marxism-Leninism-and for an ultra-left deviation, we did not know how to adapt that slogan in instruments that allow us to have a participation of another type in the elections of 73. But In our balances of that period we understood that the main error of all that current of the left in which the PCR was coming and that it was at the base of ultra -leftism, was on the one hand the non -clarity about the transformation of the USSR and, on the other, The idea that the triumph of the revolution was easy and fast. And this was not possible because there was no revolutionary party, because it had been degraded and useless in practice by the betrayal of the leader of the PC. And this party was not going to be created so easy; Neither as a simple byproduct of the organization of a group armed with twenty guerrillas in the countryside, nor as an organizational echo of the armed propaganda actions of urban terrorism, nor as a result of three or four tactical slogans appropriate to the political time. Experience was going to demonstrate that the creation of a revolutionary force capable of directing a revolutionary process like those years in Argentina was going to be a very long and complex process. Unfortunately, the experience shows, as Lenin said, that the new generations of combatants have the predisposition and the tendency not to study, therefore, to forget or not take into account the experience of the previous generations. The same thing happened to us, so they could have fun with that new left the old mefistopheles of revisionism, which knowing well the clearingers where others had shot, were pushing us towards them.

<strong>
    - Until the end of the dictatorship of Lanusse you were mixed - although to the elbows - in the swarm of groups of the revolutionary “new left”, most of whose directions would end up being controlled by Moscow via Havana. But in the brief period between the 1973 presidential elections and the coup d'etat of 1976, the PCR will make decisive adjustments in its line that will make it an absolutely independent, unique and unmistakable expression of Argentine politics. How was that transit of the blank vote to the defense of the government of Mrs. Isabel Perón?
   </strong>
</p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   - For Perón's return in 1972 we made an adjustment. We had opened the fight against the theory of dependent capitalism that as we already saw, denied in block the work with the national bourgeoisie, etc. And in November of 72 we participated in the columns that went to receive Perón with an independent position, of unity and struggle with the Peronist masses. That was a very big change. Then they acted very powerful forces to get out of that course.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   With regard to this I take a reflection on the history of the PC. There are some issues that seem to be similar, or that, maybe, as Gramsci would say, are laws of the development of communist parties. The PC was born in 18 and only in 1928 defined the character of the revolution in Argentina with the help of the international. It took ten years.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   In those ten years they also had a left line. In practice they formulated a revolutionary approach of the socialist type of start and took ten more years to define who friends and enemies were from the strategic point of view and clarify the issue of what each political party represents and each political figure and each political figure .
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   The discovery of friends and enemy classes demands a social economic study, as Mao says in his analysis of Chinese society. Determined classes, the problem of what are the political positions of these classes is subtracted; of the bourgeoisie, of the little bourgeoisie, of the little liberal bourgeoisie, of the small nationalist bourgeoisie. And determined in a country like Argentina, where there is a fierce dispute between different imperialist forces, there is another problem, that of knowledge of what the different political figures express. On his deficiencies in this knowledge, the PC, in 1930, was self -criticized in the elbow self -criticism.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   The practice was teaching that the frontmen, the representatives of certain powers, the economic groups change. In Argentine politics there are many Free Lancers, as they say now, many mercenaries who work for the best bidder, or surprisingly change their employers. This is the case of these men who from nowhere become great figures of national political life, having their own capital.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   And there are union leaders. For Sample Vale Jorge Triaca: First he was an employee of the plastic guild who soon had it for a man of the Panam company; Later, thanks to “the savings” of his mother -in real estate business. This "own capital" is also composed of political, military and businesswoman relations, which becomes part of the ruling classes.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   These Free Lancers mercenaries exist in all dependent and colonial countries. That is why Chou Enlai, when he talks about the single front in China, refers to this point. Sometimes those testaferros change abruptly position because they change pattern, and says Chou enlai that cause great confusion.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   What we always did was to place ourselves from the side of the working class and the town, take the struggles for their claims, fight against the dictatorship of Onganía, of Levingston, of Lanusse. Now, for this fight to be successful, more than that is required. All these analysis and knowledge of the classes, their political figures, the testaferros, etc. are required etc. This carries a process, and in it we made many mistakes, because sometimes we were easily induced to deception ...
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   We had constituted the anti -imperialist Revolutionary Front (FR) with communist avant -garde and some personalities. VC was pushing a line that led us to inoperative ultraizism; He raised the slogan "wins who wins, loses the people", states with which we did not agree. Therefore, on May 25, 1973, when the new government assumes, we were in the square, after an express discussion in which we decided to go without posters or badges. But we participate with the Peronist masses and other leftist sectors of all the events that happened that day, such as the release of the prisoners of the dictatorship.

<strong>
    Talk organized by the JCR de Rosario
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Within the framework of the five years of the departure of Otto Vargas, first general secretary of our beloved revolutionary communist party, a talk was held on Friday 16 in Rosario a talk that had as its protagonists the last three general secretaries of the revolutionary communist youth: Luciano Orellano (2005-2010); Pablo Landó (2010-2016) and Luciano Álvarez (from 2016 to the present), who shared their experiences and learning together with him, fundamental today for the fight against the antipopular and anti-national policy of the government of Javier Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   On September 3, 1929 in Choele Choel, Río Negro, the most rebel of all was born: Otto César Vargas.
  </p>
<p>
   The tribute was also present in the great work of his works written at a table that gathered all literature materials.
  </p>
<p>
   Luciano Orellano, the first to direct the word, emphasized the life and work of Otto and the importance of having traveled those countries of the world in which the socialist revolutions had triumphed - who would visit Germany with him in 2006 - and in the great Outto's transcendence as a picture of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism at the international level. He also mentioned Patriots such as General San Martín, Mariano Moreno, Juana Azurduy, Manuel Belgrano, José Gervasio Artigas and spoke of Otto's integration with Argentine reality, which cannot be understood without a deep knowledge of our history and our reality . He stressed that Otto was the son of a generation that saw how the Red Army defeated the Nazis and nailed the red flag. The living experience that all our action is a cry of war against imperialism. And he concluded that "Otto is a need for every day, of all those who want to find the path of the revolution in Argentina."
  </p>
<p>
   Pablo Landó, in turn, stressed that Otto was fully convinced of the importance of the study and that the JCR can be mass and when culture and sport were worked. He referred to the history of clubs in Argentina and the deep ideological burden that sports and cultural work has and that is above all a closed fact for thousands and thousands of kids and kids in Argentina. "The best tribute we can do to Otto is to continue raising the flags of the revolution, starting from the conviction that none of the structural problems will be solved without a revolutionary exit and I have no doubt that we will succeed" .
  </p>
<p>
   Finally, Luciano Álvarez, general secretary of the Revolutionary Communist Youth, highlighted in his words the importance of the activity in relation to talking about Otto is talking about the history of the party, talking about who we are, talking about communism and Fight for the revolution, which was for what fought until the end of his days. “Many times the communists gave us the dead, the ruling classes said they had buried communism, but what also demonstrated life and history is that every time we died, the communists returned and we have a present And let's fight. We have a great responsibility and legacy that Otto left us, which has to do with fighting to guarantee the historical continuity of a line of proletarian hegemony that can play a role from the point of view of the triumph of the revolution in Argentina and that has to See with defending with all the line of the game. ” And finally he added that "the story of Otto Vargas has not finished writing, because a communist, a revolutionary is not judged only by what he has done throughout his militant life, but for what he leaves" .
  </p>
<p>
   In a full room, with the enthusiasm of validity, conviction and revolutionary passion that otto brings us, this sense tribute closed with everyone chanting in a loud voice: «They all scream, shout strong, Otto Vargas even Victory always!".

     Economic, political and ideological fight
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   In its first union phase, the economic struggle is spontaneous, that is, it is inevitably born from the same situation in which the proletariat is in the bourgeois regime, but it is not for itself revolutionary. (…) The "spontaneity" element is not enough for the revolutionary struggle, since it never leads to the working class beyond the limits of existing bourgeois democracy. It is necessary that the conscientious element, the "ideological" element, that is, the understanding of the conditions in which it is struggling, of the social relations in which the worker lives, of the fundamental tendencies that operate in the system of these relationships, of the Development process suffered by society for existence within irreducible antagonisms, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   (…) Certainly, you cannot ask every worker from the mass to have a complete awareness of all the complex function that its class is resolved to develop in the process of humanity development, because that must be asked for the members of the party .

<p>
   This resistance in Ukraine transformed the imperialist invasion into a national war, with thousands of dead and civilians, millions of displaced and entire devastated regions. Much of the Ukrainian energy infrastructure is destroyed.
  </p>
<p>
   It is the greatest military conflict in Europe since World War II in the last century.
  </p>
<p>
   Ukraine is currently in a difficult military situation. But his people tireless and heroically fighting the progress of the Russian forces, which keep a large part of the territory, together with the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula that occurred in 2014. Ukraine caused tens of thousands of casuals to the Russian army, between dead dead and injured. Despite the adversity and inferiority of troops and armaments, Ukrainian forces continue to hit Russian forces.
  </p>
<p>
   NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) a military alliance between the United States, which remains the main economic, political and military superpower, and more than 30 countries in Europe, including England, Germany and France, has put its claws in This war, giving financial support, warlike equipment and military advice to the Ukraine government.
  </p>
<p>
   Until now, NATO has prevented its troops from entering the war. Ukraine is not part of this alliance, although the countries that share border with it do, some of them, such as Poland, border with Russia. In 2023 Finland joined, which shares more than 1,000 km from its border with Russia. Sweden is close to entering the Alliance.
  </p>
<p>
   Since January 24, NATO is carrying out the largest military exercises in its history, with the deployment of more than 90 thousand soldiers, dozens of combat aircraft, helicopters, tanks, "innumerable unmanned aerial vehicles", war wars , aircraft carrier, etc. "The exercise is designed to simulate the response of the 31 nations alliance to an attack of an opponent like Russia," NATO commanders allowed to transcend Western media.
  </p>
<p>
   Russia responds to the planning of these maneuvers and the Russian Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs declared “these exercises are another element of the hybrid war that the West is unleashing against Russia. An exercise in this magnitude (...) marks the definitive and irrevocable return of NATO to the schemes of the Cold War, when the process of military planning, resources and infrastructure were prepared for a confrontation with Russia ».
  </p>
<p>
   In Russia, confirming Putin's control over the government for the next elections, Alexei Navalny prison appeared in prison, a well -known opponent to the Russian president. The government of this imperialist power tries to silence the cost of war in Ukraine, with thousands of dead and tens of thousands of young people who leave the country to avoid being recruited.
  </p>
<p>
   In Europe, Germany handles the highest military budget in decades, and tries to position itself as a continental leader after the failure of its policy of containing Russia through trade, through the purchase of gas and oil. It is estimated that to replenish the amount of weapons that Europe sent to Ukraine it will have between 5 and 10 years, according to the head of Rheinmetall, the main monopoly of German armaments. More than 12,000 German soldiers began to carry out military exercises, preparing for war.
  </p>
<p>
   While Chinese imperialism raises "neutrality" in this conflict, all its actions show alignment with the Russians. At the beginning of February, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in a telephone conversation with Putin that "Russia and China must collaborate closely to defend their safety and oppose foreign interference." Last year Xi Jinping had declared a "friendship without limits with Putin." China is very interested in the trade of its electronic production with Russia (bordering country) and wants to take advantage of the price in Russian gas and oil.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>
    The war in Ukraine gets into the Yankees elections
   </strong>
</h3>
<p>
   In November of this year the presidential elections will be held in the United States. The current president of Yankee imperialism, Joe Biden, of the Democratic Party, has aspirations for re -election. His main contender is former Yankee President and current Republican candidate Donald Trump.
  </p>
<p>
   Biden is claiming the Yankee Congress to approve 60,000 million dollars in military aid for Ukraine within a broader war pack that also includes about 14,000 million dollars for Israel, and another sum for Taiwan. The Yankee Military Industrial Complex is making immense profits with the increase in the danger of war between the imperialist powers, and the fogonea.
  </p>
<p>
   Tump, on the other hand, that puts conditions to this multimillionaire package in Congress, Polvarda lifted last week saying that if NATO European countries did not update with NATO's expenses, if he were president he would not defend them before an eventual Russian attack.
  </p>
<p>
   After these statements, NATO general secretary Jens Stoltenberg clarified that 18 countries of the 31 members reached an expense of 2% of their GDP in the military budget. NATO countries will invest more than 380 billion dollars in rearma They suffer.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>
    War factors grow rapidly
   </strong>
</h3>
<p>
   All imperialisms are present in the war in Ukraine, which marks a very important milestone as a factor of World War. Since the end of last year, these factors have joined Israel's genocidal attacks to Palestine, which already caused more than 30,000 civilians and more than two million displaced Palestinians. Another focus of growing conflict is the one that faces imperialist China with Taiwan, sustained by the Yankees and other powers, with all the consequences on the control of the China Sea.
  </p>
<p>
   All these war factors aggravate the condition of oppressed countries, and also in the workers and peoples of imperialist countries: inflation and unemployment rates are reaching record values worldwide. Great Britain and Japan have officially announced last week that their economies entered into recession. The exit of the cyclic crises of capitalism is, for imperialist countries, always with wars.
  </p>
<p>
   Two years after the Russian imperialist invasion of Ukraine, we reaffirm what was raised by the 13th Congress of our party, in October 2022: “From the PCR we repudiate the Russian invasion to Ukraine. We reaffirm all our solidarity with the Ukrainian people we oppose the imperialist war. Neither Russia, the United States and NATO. Ukraine has the right to decide his destiny. We defend the sovereignty and self -determination of peoples. We continue to denounce both Russian imperialism and the intervention of Yankee and NATO imperialism, which put the world to the edge of a new imperialist confrontation that will only bring more blood and pain to the peoples of the world. ”

   At times where the adjustment of the national government has a face of despair and suffering, where the remedies for our older adults and vaccines for our children begin to lack is that we need more than ever strengthening the ties of solidarity while we continue to fight to change the course of This policy.

   In the context of adjustment that is lived in Argentina, national universities and research institutes were completely definant. The budget for this year is the one determined in 2022 by 2023, and taking into account that there were more than 200% inflation, that would allow to work until May.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   The increases in fees and salaries did not approach inflation this year and a part of the workers who depend on the science and technical agency have their frozen salaries since last year.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   Repeated science workers mobilized the scientific pole to claim for the new income, the publication of the orders of merit (owed since January 12), layoffs of the administrative area and promotions of the support personnel.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   The Conicet directory met on February 14 and thanks to a great mobilization of hundreds of fellows, researchers and support personnel, it was achieved that they give some certainties of what will happen with the scholarships. The 300 completion scholarships will be effective in August (instead of April) and type I doctoral scholarships there will be 600 (cutting 700 more they should give).
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   It is essential to continue with the path of struggle that has been giving to fight for salary updates, the contracts of the administrative staff and the 700 scholarships they want to cut.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   Last week it was shown that if we go out and demand what corresponds to us, they cannot make deaf ears and are forced to open their hands. The unity of the entire scientific system is necessary, organizing and seeking to reach each and every one of the science workers to achieve mass and representative movements.

   First, a massive act was developed and marches at the Bariloche Civic Center in front of the Municipal Palace with more than 400 people. Raúl Rajneri, secretary of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Río Negro, took the floor and said: “These rulers we have get used to treating Lewis as a friend. The English usurpan the Falkland Islands, they want to seize our territory in Antarctica. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   In addition, as he held eight years ago since the first day in claim of sovereignty, Rajneri stated: “Here in Lake Escondid We are here to defend our Argentine territory. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   "With this new march we are going to build the new national strike that allows us to discourage not only hidden lake, but to all the landowners of our country," said the general secretary of the National ATE and the Autonomous CTA Río Negro, Rodolfo Aguiar.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   At noon, the column departed in groups to Foyel, 50 kilometers south, at the entrance of the Tacuifi road, blocked access to the hidden lake, still usurped by the Englishman Joe Lewis.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   After eight years of tireless struggle and several judicial failures in favor of the people, the road was closed with a fence and the Government of Río Negro through the security forces, protect again abroad. The protesters again threw stones and received aggressions from the local ducks that take care of Lewis's interests. Fortunately there were no injuries.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   This year's march has as prelude to the journey through the mountain that undertook a group of 24 people from different organizations in the country, who walked to Lake Sovereignty, but could not advance more due to the conditions of impassability of the path.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   The day was precisely on February 14, the day in which the fifth anniversary of the death of our beloved Secretary General of the PCR, Otto Vargas was fulfilled. In his native province, we honor him on the street, in the struggle to recover ours on the way to the National and Social Liberation Revolution, socialism and communism; for those who he dedicated his life.

Francisca told us, first of all, the importance of the meeting of the State and Guilds Front of State Companies held on February 15 at the ATE headquarters in CABA: “This is the second meeting we make. The first was on December 5 of last year, in which we participated centrally organizations of the Autonomous CTA, and what we fight is to add unions of other centrals. I believe that the 15th meeting was very important, with guilds, delegates, internal and federations, with which we agreed to unify the fight against Milei's attacks against the entire public system, and the State as guarantor of rights. From the political point of view it was very important, since we agreed a day of struggle with mobilizations towards the end of February, if possible, splicing with the claim of Ctera, rejecting this policy of dismissals and the state of the State.
  </p>
<p>
   “And we also agreed to advance with the dissemination of what is done from our places, be it in the universities, companies and different instances of the State, to dismantle the fallacies of this government, for example, that state companies are deficient. The sovereignty sounded like a fundamental issue, with examples of many partners who defend it in their workplaces. We saw the need to disseminate what a state is present or anchored and is absent from education, health, road safety, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   “The plenary claimed for the urgent reinstatement of all and all the firing colleagues, and in addition to specific actions of different guilds, advance in the concretion of a new great national unemployment with mobilization, such as January 24. Because beyond the Bus Law was defeated, the DNU is still in force, and this government continues to liquefy the salaries and apply a brutal adjustment. ”
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>
    The situation in universities
   </strong>
</h3>
<p>
   Francisca tells us that the coup of the government over universities occurs in two ways: “On the one hand is the liquefaction of wages, as in the rest of national state. Our salary is devaluing it, to be able to meet that objective of the "zero deficit." In January, university teachers and researchers had no salary recomposition. We come from 6% increase in December, and in February we had 10%, to charge in March. This is a salary loss well above 100%, in relation to inflation of these months. And while we have a new call to peers, we know that the offer will be poor.
  </p>
<p>
   “Therefore, there is a complicated year, because we will want to continue liquefying the salary, and it will surely be a year of a lot of struggle, that we will try to be with the widest unit with the set of teaching federations. This also came out in the state plenary, the need to achieve the widest unit and organization to hit together.
  </p>
<p>
   “The other issue at the University is the budget. We continue with that of 2023, and as the rectors have already warned, with this budget the operation of universities beyond March or April is not guaranteed.
  </p>
<p>
   “We are going to try to coordinate the protest with all the sectors of the university, the students, the non -teachers and the rectors themselves, so that in unity we go out to claim what corresponds to us.
  </p>
<p>
   “There are sectors that seek to face this lack of budget with different mercantilist alternatives, such as the sale of services or tariff, which would go to a privatization of university education, not recognized. From the historical Conadu we planted ourselves as guarantors of the college gratuity. And in that I think we agree with all the federations. ”
  </p>
<p>
   The Secretary of the Historical Conadu says that “this is going to be a year of a lot of struggle. And we want it to be an in conjunction of all sectors, as stated in the state plenary. That is why we are meeting with the other University Teaching Federations, stopping the differences to put in front of the needs we have.
  </p>
<p>
   “From universities we are in a battle for intellectual sovereignty, in the face of this policy that aims to privatize and the sale of everything in Argentina. When I speak of intellectual sovereignty I mean the defense of science, technology, and everything that is taught and investigated in the public university. All this cannot fall into private hands.
  </p>
<p>
   “We have to discuss which is the best exit, for the needs of the people and the homeland, not that the market decides, as they say. Because they are privileged only some careers, finance, economy, and those that always lose are social or humanistic calls.
  </p>
<p>
   “We do not deny that the market exists, and that many and many of those who graduate are incorporated into that market, in various ways. What we propose is what the university is for. ”
  </p>
<p>
   Francisca dismisses us ensuring that the budget drowning will begin to feel shortly, as soon as the activities start in universities, some of which have already begun, and they are expected to be fully in the last week of March.
  </p>
<p>
   “That budget drowning feels differently in universities. Some have outsourced all safety and cleaning tasks, and there are already attempts to allocate administrators to these tasks. That is why I say that we are going to a year of intense fight against this national government policy. ”
  </p>

<strong>
    National Universities Unions Front
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   On Friday 16, the National Government offered just a 6% salary increase for the month of February, which was rejected by all the guilds present. "The loss of the purchasing power of the salary of teachers and nodocentes is more than 50% with respect to the inflation of the months of December and January," denounced a guild document, adding "the government intends to establish a salary reduction for teaching Pre -University removing the fonid. That incentive represents a significant percentage of the pre -university salary. ”
  </p>
<p>
   Prior to the joint meeting, the National Universities Unions Front was formed, composed of Historical Conadu -Conadu -Fedun -Fagdut -UDA -ctera -fatun, guilds belonging to the Autonomous CTA, CTA of the workers and CGT.
  </p>
<p>
   Responsible for the National Government of the conflict, the guilds culminate the document affirming "we defend the public and free university at the service of the great majorities, decent wages for workers and decent workers and retirements."

<p>
   The National Government, chaired by Javier Milei, in just over two months has greatly deepened the sufferings of the Argentine people. The growth of inflation has led us to lose much of the purchasing power of our salaries. Thousands of teachers and also our students and their families, we are the ones who pay the consequences of low salaries with a school basket that has risen 450% the last year and with the brutal increase in transport.
  </p>
<p>
   The National Government takes anti -government and anti -democratic measures enriching a “caste” of monopolies and landowners who are behind the drafting of their decrees, bills and economic measures. And religiously pay an illegitimate, usurative and fraudulent external debt contracted by its macrista partners as the current Minister of Economy Luis Caputo.
  </p>
<p>
   The federal nature of our country overwhelms the provinces, particularly to the province of Buenos Aires, shrinking the items of federal co -participation and cutting the transfer of discretionary funds and subsidies to transport and services. Now, as part of its measures against the people and the country, it has decided to stop turning the budget items for education to each province: the National Teaching Incentive Fund (FONID), Connectivity, Salary Compensation Fund and other education items ( Pedagogical programs, school canteens and milk cup, progress, connect equality and school infrastructure). It also eliminates the institutional improvements of technical schools and budgetary lines, which are fundamental for its operation. And refuses to convene the National Teaching Parity.
  </p>
<p>
   President Milei's false argument is that education "is a problem of the governors of each province", denying articles 14 and 14 bis of the National Constitution, among others, when their measures hit the people, forgetting that the funds of the funds of the that appropriate were also generated in each province, by the men and women who produce wealth in Argentina and who are now victims of their measures.
  </p>
<p>
   The pockets are also filled in the province of Buenos Aires many of those who direct the national government in the shadows, such as Paolo Rocca de Techint, Elsztain de Cresud and Irsa, Galperin de Mercado Libre, to name just a few.
  </p>
<p>
   In that context, the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires summoned the teaching parity he offered, according to the FUDB: “20% of the general average of increase on the basis of calculation December 2023, as of February 1, 2024 This increase will also be perceived by retired. In addition, he reported that he will increase the sections of family assignments. ” At a time that by the measures of Milei we will stop receiving in our salary what corresponds to the nation of Fonid, connectivity and compensatory fund.
  </p>
<p>
   We understand that this increase is insufficient. We come from the devaluation of Milei in December, where an interannual inflation of 211.4%was closed. In the parity of that month, a 2023 increase of 153%was established by provincial decree, with respect to the Salary Dic ’22, which generated an important salary loss.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with the denial of the National Teaching Joint and establishing the minimum, vital and mobile salary, the provincial government agreed to the request of the unions: parity every month, that the increases are also perceived by the retirees and retirees and the increase in Family assignments. So that the teachers are not those who pay the adjustment, we need a salary increase that allows us at least to recover all the lost salary, and then win inflation.
  </p>
<p>
   This is also necessary to unite the teachers, the educational community, the people and the Buenos Aires government, in the fight against the theft made by the national government of the provincial funds and our salaries.
  </p>
<p>
   To turn that situation we propose:
  </p>
<ol>
<li>
    That the CTARA Congress promotes the non -start of classes throughout the country, and a progressive struggle plan, in response to confiscation by the National Government of Educational Funds and the refusal to convene the National Teaching Joint.
   </li>
<li>
    In the province of Buenos Aires, compensate for the removal of resources, advancing with a mandatory contribution by the richest sectors of the province, as was the extraordinary contribution to the great fortunes. Initiative that was already promoted at the national level during the government of the front of all, given the crisis situation caused by the pandemic.
   </li>
<li>
    With these funds, finance fair salaries to teachers and state and increase the educational budget for school food, infrastructure, scholarships, useful, sneakers, overalls, etc.
   </li>
<li>
    Fight in the streets, together with the educational community and the people, in the widest unity, from the multisectoral, claiming the National Government of late federal co -participation, discretionary transfers and educational funds as part of the struggle initiatives we have for in front, which have as its main objective, turn the 70/23 hunger and delivery DNU.
   </li>
<li>
    We reaffirm that education is a right and not an essential service.
   </li>
</ol>

<p>
   This triumph was the result of the fight that toured the entire National Bank throughout the country and that occurred from day one.
  </p>
<p>
   The same next day that the 70/23 DNU was announced, a massive assembly was held at the Central House and many branches to reject the claim to privatize it and/or transform it into a corporation, convened by the internal union that headed the General Secretary of the Guild Sergio Palazzo.
  </p>
<p>
   The National Bank is the main financial tool of the national state, it is 100% state, autarkic and gives profits that it contributes to the treasure. It has 23% of national savings and hundreds of credit lines for SMEs and agricultural sectors that only the BNA attends. It has a branch in each town and city of the country of more than 10 thousand inhabitants and in its organic letter defines as one of its objectives to contribute to the development of regional economies.
  </p>
<p>
   It is a lie that it is inefficient and has low profitability as it intends to install the new president of the bank, Daniel Tillard, of the Mediterranean Foundation. The main debt in delinquency has been the product of the scam made during the Macri government in more than 300 million dollars of the Vicentin case.
  </p>
<p>
   The unemployment and mobilization of 24/1 and massive hug that was made of hundreds of workers and then went to Congress was overwhelming. Hundreds of assemblies are being carried out throughout the country receiving the support of many production sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   Today once again we relaunch the campaign against privatization, also joining the workers of the other companies that are in the list of privatizations such as Arsat, Airlines, NucleoElectric, military manufactures, Fadea, Tandanor. And this Tuesday 20/2 (at the close of this edition) we will perform an act by calling the CGT, social organizations and other productive sectors to unite in the defense of the BNA.
  </p>
<p>
   The fight continues against decree 70/23 that is still in force large A great fight too.
  </p>
<p>
   This is why, despite the triumph against the Bus Law, it is necessary that the DNU be annulled and declared unconstitutional
  </p>
<p>
   You have to keep your guard up, because this government is not going to give your arm to twist and we will have to defeat your street plans. The workers of the National Bank are going to fight until the end!

   From the class and combative current we express our deep concern for the lack of agreement for the increase in the minimum, vital and mobile salary. In a context marked by the adjustment policies promoted by the government of Javier Milei, which triggered inflation through the clouds and hits the purchasing power of the whole of the workers, and especially in those with precarious works and in our retirees .
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   From the CCC we firmly support the proposal of the CGT, in agreement with all the centrals, which request an increase of 85%, a measure that contributes to alleviating, although partially, the damage inflicted on the salaries of the workers by the adjustment policies inflationary of the national government.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   We understand that the absence of government proposal, in tune with the business sectors, is a maneuver to make the meeting fail and be able to close it by decree. Thus, in fact, we are the only workers to pay the adjustment.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   It is clear that the adjustment on "the caste" was a campaign slogan, the reality is that the adjustment is about the Argentine people, especially the precarious workers, the retirees, and all those who live from the informal economy.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   For a minimum, vital and mobile salary that guarantees a decent life for all workers in Argentina!

<p>
   Recently, Milei insisted again in various public statements with his idea of dollarization. He argued that it was "getting closer and closer," although it ruled out its implementation for this year for time reasons.
  </p>
<p>
   Without the slightest tap, he also said that "the chainsaw and the blender, which are the pillars of the adjustment, do not negotiate." Some economists alert precisely that with inflation liquefaction it would be preparing the land for dollarization. Because, in addition to facilitating the spray of social spending, wages and other income, it contributes to liquefy the monetary base in general, as well as the remunerated liabilities of the BCRA (currently almost all “passive passes” and very little of Leliq), which are one of the main pitfalls for that plan.
  </p>
<p>
   Dollarization was one of Milei's main campaign slogans, with which he appealed to the illusion of many people to be able to collect in "hard currency", given the constant loss of purchasing power of weight by galloping inflation; measure that was accompanied by the crazy proposal to eliminate the Central Bank. With his assumption, both ideas seemed to have been quick frizzed; In fact, he did not even mention them in his inaugural speech. But after the defeat of the Omnibus Law in Congress, in a framework of massive rejection in the streets - with the cacerolazos, unemployment and working and popular mobilization - it has tried to resume the political initiative again putting the issue on the table.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei part of the erroneous premise that inflation is due exclusively, at any time and place, to excess monetary issuance to finance the fiscal deficit. With her, she tries to justify the need for dollarization, by removing the Central Bank (BCRA) the power to issue.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>
    Viability and consequences of dollarize
   </strong>
</h3>
<p>
   In the first place, with or without elimination of the BCRA, this measure means renouncing the economic sovereignty of issuing the national currency, regulating the interest rate and setting the exchange rate, among other basic issues of a central bank. It is impossible to think of a national development policy for the benefit of the popular sectors renouncing these basic instruments in advance, along with other losses decades ago that should recover, such as the nationalization of deposits and the orientation of the credit in favor of national production , use and popular consumption. It is clear that this central bank does not serve the people, but with the excuse of fighting inflation, which actually feeds with its disastrous economic policy, Milei seeks to deliver the monetary sovereignty of our country.
  </p>
<p>
   Secondly, the dollarization would deepen the extreme of our US dependence, since the terms of said scheme should naturally be negotiated with the broadcasting country of that currency. From there in more, the Argentine economy will be subject to the cycles of monetary and exchange policy of Yankee imperialism (in particular, to the appreciation or depreciation of its currency globally).
  </p>
<p>
   Another not less issue is related to the economic feasibility of its implementation, as well as immediate implications for real salary and other popular income. What exchange rate would dollarization be made, that is, the exchange of the pesos of the economy for dollars, and even more, with what dollars? Because, as is known, the BCRA suffers a long time ago of a pressing shortage of reservations. In this regard, Milei said: “We have accumulated about USD 7,000 million reserves and the monetary base is USD 7,000, 8,000 million. I mean, we are nothing (to dollarize). ” However, confuse or misrepresent the numbers. It is true that the BCRA has managed to buy that amount so far in its management, but with an accumulation of (own) net reserves (own) (3.6 billion). And this does not mean that net reserves continue to be negative at about 7.5 billion dollars (which means that the BCRA has used dollars borrowed, including a SWAP section with China). On the other hand, at the official exchange rate, the monetary base is currently equivalent to USD 12.8 billion, significantly higher than Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   This accumulation of reserves has been carried out at the expense of the mega devaluation and the deliberately caused recession, which contracts internal demand and imports of the dependent local economy. Incidentally, Milei shared in X (former twist) a journalistic note entitled "For the monetary squeeze, inflation and recession, savers sell dollars to reach the end of the month." Not only pushes poverty millions of Argentines with their economic policy, but celebrate it through networks.
  </p>
<p>
   As part of this recessive plan, the goal of accumulation of reservations until December 2023 agreed with the IMF implies ending the year with null net reserves. That is, without still having a single dollar to be able to carry out the rescue of the monetary base; And not to mention the remunerated liabilities of the BCRA (which support the bulk of the deposits in pesos), which are equivalent to USD 35,000 million. To try to answer this issue of the lack of dollars, indicated by most economists of various political orientations, Milei and their related economists appeal to very little consistent and much less realistic financial gadgets.
  </p>
<p>
   Therefore, the BCRA is still far from having the dollars necessary to carry out the rescue of the economy's weights to an exchange rate that is not astronomical. Naturally, to accelerate the liquefaction of the weights of the economy, the government could resort to a new devaluation jump, which will further spray salaries, retirements and other income, as well as health, education, etc. spending, which already had A monumental cut in real terms in the brief management time of Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   The following issue around dollarization lies in the very functioning of the scheme. As happened in the ‘90s under convertibility, the expansion of the monetary base (already in dollars) would be subject to having surpluses in external accounts; In particular, in the current account of the balance of payments, which is chronically deficient due to the deformed development and dependent on the Argentine economy; And it will be even more with the policies to which Milei points out, of unrestricted commercial and financial opening, and freely for the foreignization of the economy. This leaves the door open to the need for constant external indebtedness (anyway, banned for the moment for Argentina); or to a chronic recession, with high unemployment, given the sustained lack of liquidity of the economy that would generate the external deficit. In such a context, they would end up proliferating the quasi provincial currencies to finance public spending and pay salaries, as happened towards the end of convertibility.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition to this, the lack of a last instance lender (because the BCRA, beyond continuing to exist, no longer emits the legal tender) would favor the instability of the financial system as a whole.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with adverse or disruptive, external or internal events (global crisis, drought, etc.), the BCRA would lack the ability to adjust the exchange rate or cover part of public spending with monetary emission. Without going any further, during an event like the pandemic, which generated a collapse of GDP and a strong drop in exports, the BCRA could not issue money to finance the government and thus sustain public spending until the external storm passes.
  </p>
<p>
   Worldwide, only Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama and a handful of islands have dollarized their economies.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<strong>
    Extreme dependency and sufferings of the people
   </strong>
</h3>
<p>
   Dollarization is an even more rigid scheme than the convertibility that he governed in Argentina during the ‘90s and principles of the following, which directly renounces to issue the national currency, instead of setting by law the parity with the dollar. The results of that experiment and those policies, which Milei seeks to take to the extreme, were already in sight at that time. How could it be otherwise, convertibility ended up implioing, in the midst of the worst economic and social crisis that Argentina suffered.
  </p>
<p>
   Consequently, far from being a panacea, the dollarization of the national economy would deepen to inconceivable extremes the economic and political dependence of our country, particularly with the US, causing the ruin of much of national production, especially The small and medium -sized company, and greatly aggravating the pressing economic and social situation that suffers wide popular sectors.

     With Milei, hunger grows and millions fall into poverty
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   One million people fall into poverty every month, as a consequence of the brutal adjustment of Milei, says a study by Di Tella University. The Social Observatory of the Argentine Catholic University estimates that since the Government of Milei began, poverty grew from 44.7% to 57.4%, and the destitution of 9.8% to 15%. This is equivalent to 27 million poor and almost seven million homeless!
  </p>
<p>
   Behind these figures is the drama of millions of people who do not have for daily food, which increases with each measure against the people who take this reactionary government, hunger and delivery.
  </p>
<p>
   Cynically, Milei "celebrates" an inflation that reached 51% in two months, boast of having thrown 50 thousand public workers, and having dropped 98% of transfers to the provinces.
  </p>
<p>
   The Government, with the complicity of the business chambers, boycotted and failed the meeting of the Vital and Mobile Minimum Salary Council, where the CGT and the two CTA had taken a unified order of 85%, that is, a base of $ 288,600 from the February 1.
  </p>
<p>
   Minister Caputo announced that they will be the ones who will set that salary, which is a reference for informal work, for domestic service and governs among other things the amount of social programs. It also determines the floor of the income tax, which is 15 minimum wages.
  </p>
<p>
   In line with the confiscation of funds, those who financed the procrear plan, the progress scholarships, water infrastructure works, the fire management law, the stabilizing fund of the price of wheat, the construction fund in popular neighborhoods, and It still does not send merchandise to thousands of popular dining rooms.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei had already been stealing to the provinces the co -participation funds and discretionary transfers, and with the removal of transportation subsidy is causing a disaster throughout the country. Now he also confiscated the educational funds, including the FONID (Teaching Incentive Fund) and says the most campaign that he will not summon the National Teaching Joint: "That the provinces are fixed."
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, the government kept retirement and pensions frozen. Now he announced an increase of 30% when the accumulated inflation of this period is 70%, which imposed an infamous adjustment in retirees and pensioners, liquefying their income.
  </p>
<p>
   Minister Pettovello suspended the Directorate of Direct Assistance for Special Situations (Dadse), which provides oncological remedies, chronic disabled diseases and acute pathologies urgent to hospitals. This policy is already charging many direct victims, such as neighborhood leader Aldo Pinto, who died in Salta on February 15 due to lack of cancer drugs.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course, in a reward for vote in favor of the “Bus Law”, Milei transferred 1,000 million pesos to Governor Valdés, to pay the television of the Carnival of Corrientes.
  </p>
<p>
   Inverse of the legendary novel character, Robin Hood,
   <strong>
    President Milei is "Hood Robin", he steals what little they have to the poor, to distribute it between the richest caste and the IMF.

     They want to sweep the ANSES
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The use of installed capacity in the industry was in December the youngest of the last 12 years.
  </p>
<p>
   The fall in economic activity is between 20% and 30%. It caused a collapse in consumption, with 30%peaks. This policy generates the sinking of purchasing power impacting fully on factories, especially in SMEs.
  </p>
<p>
   The Government removed the transport subsidies, increased electricity in the AMBA more than 150% and the increase in gas is coming, although the price of oil fell and the oil companies gain fortunes.
  </p>
<p>
   This government uses the silver that produces the work of our people to continue paying the debt with the IMF and other usurers. In January, the debt with the fund went from 40,899 million dollars to 43,157 million. That is, we pay debt and the debt grows. The same goes for adjustable bonds and titles for inflation or dollar.
  </p>
<p>
   The Government celebrates that they would have achieved "the fiscal balance." Apply what Nicolás Avellaneda said in 1877, when he said: "If necessary, we will pay the debt to the blood, sweat and tears of the Argentines", of course the blood, sweat and tears put them the town and not they.
  </p>
<p>
   The school basket increased 450%. More than $ 230,000 are needed to face the return to classes. There are already families who have to decide which of their children will go to school this year. With this policy, school dropout will grow and with the crisis, thousands who were in private school will turn to the public, which will deepen their collapse. The only measure taken by Milei is the increase in school allocation to $ 70 thousand (amount charged only once in March), which the fathers and mothers of 7.3 million boys and girls who attend from the initial level to The secondary
  </p>
<p>
   While keeping shipments to the dining rooms of public schools at zero, the Government exempts the payment of employer contributions to private school owners.
  </p>
<p>
   The Government wants to appropriate the ANSES sustainability fund (around 76,000 million dollars) which is the guarantee for retirement. Those who drive this looting to retirees are monopolies such as Molinos Río de la Plata, Cresud, from businessman Eduardo Elsztain (milei financier), Pampa Energía, the Techint, Clarín, Telecom and Aluar group, who want to recover actions from which this fund is owner.
  </p>
<p>
   Within the December decretazo, the Government included the repeal of the Land Law, which at the time imposed a maximum of 15% for land tenure in Argentina. The measure is in the middle of a judicial battle, but it is still in force.
  </p>
<p>
   Great foreign investors seek to increase the looting of our lands and the resources that are in them, as a journalistic investigation shows who are "the owners of the earth", which reach more than one million hectares. And the great landowners expand their stays leading to the crisis to the farmers (see page 5 of this edition).
  </p>
<p>
   Every day this policy adds 3,000 new poor, wages are struck between the hands and large sectors of national bourgeoisie see how their small businesses are pushed at the close. Meanwhile a handful of monopolies and landowners take the money in shovel.
  </p>
<p>
   According to a report from
   <em>
    Page 12
   </em>
   "Unilever, Procter, Arcor, Bimbo, La Serenísima, Celusal, two anchors, personal, movistar, clear and the prepaids led the price increases in January", well above the average of the inflation, already very high, of a 20, of a 20, 6%.

<strong>
     A policy that leads us to be pawns of the dispute between the imperialist powers
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The deepening of the struggles, in this Argentina played by several imperialist powers, sharpens the fights above within the dominant classes block.
  </p>
<p>
   This is seen in the comings and turns between macrismo and freedom progresses, on what conditions those of the PRO would advance in their integration in government positions, and in an agreement of their blocks in Congress.
  </p>
<p>
   In a context of growth of war factors in the world, Milei reaffirms their alignment with Western imperialist powers, the United States, England and Israel. They are the three main countries that vote against Argentine claims for Malvinas in the UN.
  </p>
<p>
   At a time when the world economy is going through great turbulence. Great Britain and Japan officially recognized that their economies entered into recession, after three months without growth. The economy of Chinese imperialism continues with great problems.
  </p>
<p>
   The president of Brazil, Lula da Silva, has just declared that what is doing Israel's fascist government is a genocide and compared it in history: "Like when Hitler decided to kill the Jews."
  </p>
<p>
   In this situation, Milei traveled a few weeks ago to support that criminal government endorsing the genocide about the Palestinian people, after more than three months of occupation in Gaza.
  </p>
<p>
   This week receives the United States Secretary of State
   <strong>
    Antony Blinken, and then will travel to Washington to participate in the Conference of Conservative Political Action, which supports Donald Trump in his career to the Yankee presidency
   </strong>
<strong>
    .
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Milei will be returning from the United States when two years of the Russian imperialist invasion to Ukraine, which has been heroically resisted by the Ukrainian army.
  </p>
<p>
   A month ago, during the Davos forum, Milei met with the English chancellor David Cameron. On that occasion, Milei described the encounter as "excellent" and eluded to respond if the Malvinas issue was touched. On Monday, Foreign Minister Cameron visited Las Malvinas. When leaving London, he declared provocatively that: "The Falkland Islands are a valuable part of the British family ... the issue of sovereignty (with Argentina) will not be the object of discussion." Given this, the Argentine Chancellor, Diana Mondino, makes a humiliating silence.
  </p>
<p>
   The imperialist powers advance rapidly in their preparations for a new military confrontation, and Milei's delivery policy transforms us into pawns of that dispute.
  </p>
<p>

<strong>
     Faced with this policy, struggles grow
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The government, since he assumed, has been imposing a policy of tremendous adjustments, with a large increase in inflation and a terrible recession. It has paralyzed public works, and dismissals and suspensions grow in private companies and shops.
  </p>
<p>
   Our PCR already defined in November that this policy had to be faced, and from leading the struggles, fighting to unite everything that can be united to defeat adjustment and delivery.
  </p>
<p>
   Today a trail of struggles crosses Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
   On February 14 it was held in Bariloche and El Bolsón, the day of launching to the march for sovereignty to Lake hidden, starring the Autonomous CTA, ATE, CCC, PTP-PCR Río Negro, we are and various social and political organizations.
  </p>
<p>
   At the close of this edition, thousands of bank workers, accompanied by other unions, mobilized in defense of the National Bank.
  </p>
<p>
   Among the teachers, the demand for strength measures such as the non -starting of classes grows. The university teachers have also unified in a front claiming urgent salary and funds for public universities.
  </p>
<p>
   The guild of railway machinists, the fraternity, announced a national strike for 21, before a salary offer that does not cover inflation.
  </p>
<p>
   Chubut oil protests grow due to the lack of investment in “conventional” wells and workers' construction workers, which claim for the paralysis of Chinese dams.
  </p>
<p>
   While Milei attacks popular artists such as Lali Espósito and María Becerra, unity also grows between actors, musicians and artists who reject the adjustment in culture, and pose struggle initiatives.
  </p>
<p>
   The workers and researchers of CONICET marched against the dismissals, lack of funds and postponement of scholarship granting.
  </p>
<p>
   The unemployed and precarious movements have agreed a new day of struggle for this week, with a center in the food claim for popular dining rooms, updating the amount of the plans and the delivery of school kits before the next start of classes.
  </p>
<p>
   From the JCR, the movement or a kid less for the drug, the CCC and a set of youth organizations drive a national day for Thursday 22 with the slogan "The pots are empty, the backpacks too."
  </p>
<p>
   A National Plenary of the State Guild Front agreed to fight measures for the 26th of this month, against layoffs and salary freezing of national employees.
  </p>
<p>
   The National Peasant Federation has been working for an agrarian and multisectoral fighting day against hunger that grows in the poor peasantry.
  </p>
<p>
   From our PCR and the movements that we integrate, we are part of those who fight that these grows that grow together in a new national active strike, convened by the workers' centrals.
  </p>
<p>
   The great movement of women and diversities has been working throughout the country to fill the streets in unity on March 8, International Day of Working Women, against the anti -rights policy of this government.
  </p>
<p>
   As seen in the great unemployment of January 24, the unit for the fight in the streets is the way to turn the validity of the Milei need and urgency decree and stop this adjustment and delivery policy
  </p>
<p>
   We continue to promote the multisectoral that arise throughout the country, and working so that they are true coordinating centers of the labor and popular struggle, to twist the arm to Milei's policy and advance in conquering another policy and another government, in favor from town.
  </p>
<p>
</p>

     Strengthen the PCR for an exit in favor of the people
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   Should we give this government time? If we sacrifice these months we will be better later? That is the propaganda of the government, and one of the great debates that run through the assemblies of the sections, in the neighborhoods, in the countryside and in all popular sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   Do not give them time, because if this policy is stabilized and Milei advances with its measures, only the situation of the great masses will worsen. Milei governs for a caste that intends an Argentina where millions work for food, with all its economy tied to the interests of the great imperialist powers and landowners.
  </p>
<p>
   He wants an Argentina like the beginning of the 20th century, when an oligarchic minority threw “butter to the ceiling” at the expense of the exploitation of the great popular majorities.
  </p>
<p>
   As we have been raising from the central committee of our party, a situation is accelerated in which the conjunction of several factors "can generate an objective revolutionary situation."
  </p>
<p>
   This requires revolutionary communists to continue at the head of the struggles fighting the widest unity to twist the arm to this policy. In the heat of the fight we go to the debate between the masses with the Guide of the Report of the Central Committee of January and the proposals of our ten measures.
  </p>
<p>
   We struggle to accumulate forces, incorporating thousands into the PCR and the JCR offering them a struggle. They are tumultuous moments where great changes can occur. It is our duty to prepare and prepare the masses so that these changes are in favor of the working class and the people and open a revolutionary path.
  </p>
<p>
   The tributes that we have been making to our beloved Otto Vargas, first general secretary of our party, five years after his death, are a central part of reaffirming those revolutionary objectives, the same for which we founded our party 56 years ago.

  Vienna | 21.02.2024 | As a result of a racist attack, the Hanau massacre, where nine immigrants lost their lives, was protested in the fourth year with the evening rally and action in Vienna.
 </p>
<p>
  The march began after the speeches that emphasized that the Hanau massacre was not an individual event, but that it was a racist attack. During the march, slogans were shouted such as ‘Hanau was not an individual event, resistance everywhere’ (Hanau War Kein Einzelfall, Widerstand Übell) and ‘all together against fascism’ (Alle Zusammen Gegen from Fascchismus).
 </p>
<p>
  In the rally and march, it was emphasized that racism was produced consciously by the sovereigns to divide the working class by the sovereign speakers, and in this respect, the struggle against racism also meant the struggle against the capitalist-imperialist order. The action was terminated by calling for rising institutional racism and calling for meeting and organizing on the streets in the struggle against racism and fascism.

   On Tuesday 20th in the House of Memory, the CCC - class and combative corner - of the Chaco, with the accompaniment of unions, social, political, human rights and legislators, provided a press conference, with the objective of
   <em>
    "Reporting a brutal attack, stigmatization and persecution by the National and Provincial Government, from the press conference headed by Patricia Bullrich in which Governor Leandro Zdero participated."
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    It is a right to replica after the complaint to Jorge Bregui, originally that a member of the CCC of the Leonese of course sexual abuse.
   </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    “
    <em>
     On a complaint to a delegate of our organization that we learn by the media, the first measure we take is to separate it to investigate, but the yellow press encompasses the entire CCC, which is a national organization, because they come not only for the social and union organizations but by the Argentine people. That is the plan of President Milei and Minister Bullrich, when in reality what the government should resolve is the hunger of the people, the adjustment and inflation and the repression that they want to carry out and that we will not allow our rights to be overwhelmed And we are not going to take a step back. "
     <strong>
</strong>
</em>
    He assured, Gladis Favretto, leader of the CCC.
   </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    José Niz, general secretary of UPCP expressed his support; "
    <em>
     The CCC is an organization that has achieved many claims for its members and the families of each of them, I admire their ability to organize ... and they also had to endure different types of situations that are not pleasant at all, many of us live together as a union And sister organization, which has to do with repressions over time but nevertheless never claudicated in what is its general objective and that has to do with what we propose as a union that if there are social organizations, it has to do because There is no state policy generated by genuine jobs and that this gives the dignity and equal opportunities to each and every one of the Chaqueños. ”
    </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    Mónica Figueroa, Reina Gómez and Simón Álvarez of the CCC of Castelli, Las Palmas and La Leonesa respectively were expressed, adding that
    <em>
     "We are not what they say, in any way, we do not accompany rapists, abusers or stalkers, never, but the truth was a situation of intimidation towards the entire community, but we are not afraid,"
     <strong>
</strong>
</em>
    referring to the 7 raids made week ago.
   </span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    Jorge Gómez and Ramona Pinay, members of the CCC and also vowels of the IDach for the Wichí and Qom ethnicity, denounced the discriminatory treatment in the raid operations, in the legal procedures and in the media:
    <em>
     “
    </em>
</span>
<em>
    Never the mainly national media were spent so much time to issues that involve native peoples, when we are killed, disappeared, abused and discriminated against in the Chaco, as now when it is accused, ”
   </em>
   They severely.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
</span>
</em>
</strong>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    Rodolfo Schwartz, provincial deputy said:
    <strong>
<em>
</em>
</strong>
<em>
     “A message for the governor of the Chaco, we have a national government that has a program that goes more thoroughly than that of the most bloody dictatorship we had, more thorough than the delivery we had of our heritage, in trampling the rights of the rights of the Workers and the people in general, they have no history and intends to be an emperor ... he believes that he can do what he wants, all governors are traitors, all deputies are traitors, all mayors are traitors, at least they are disciplined ... this Governor has two paths, or hugs Milei and Bullrich repressing the people and then they will face us, or put on the side of the town at least, supporting the struggle that we are going to carry out. ”
    </em>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">
    They accompanied and expressed their support to the Organization General Secretaries of the UPCP, CTA of the Workers, ATE, representatives of Utre Ctera, neighborhoods, free of the south, Evita Movement, we are neighborhoods, June 2, FOB, MTD , UTEP, Peronist women, MTD Darío Santillán, May 25, CEPA, MOEL, FNC, UMEL, PTP and PCR, and Provincial Legislators Analía Flores, Gladis González and Rodolfo Schwartz.

    We attach the document released by the class and combative current.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   About the press conference of Minister Bullrich
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Milei Bullrich Plan: from the criminalization of protest to the criminalization of organizations
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    We fight against gender violence
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The basis of gender violence is a relationship of unequal power. Patriarchy was imposed in thousands of years and the man exercises that violence over women. It occurs in all areas and in different ways. In relationships, in the family, adults with children, in labor relations and officials with their subordinates, a delegate, a teacher, a religious. We are against them, so we actively participate and convene together with the women's movement and feminisms to face them.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Violence is transversal, in all areas and institutions of society, however, the Government has concentrated its efforts to talk about violence, exclusively in social and union organizations.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   In a complaint of violence that must be investigated, we start from not dismissing and believing the weakest, children and women, who are mostly victims of violence. That is why, before the complaint filed against Jorge Bregui, an original Qom delegate of the Leonesa CCC, we decided to separate it from the organization while the investigation lasts and we will contribute what is necessary until the fact is clarified to reach the truth, without prejudging.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Generalization is repudiable to discredit and demonize organizations
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The press conference at Casa Rosada, led by Minister Bullrich, takes this case, pretending to show it as a policy of our entire organization. At the same time he ligures it with the case of the Foundation "Do not forget me", denounced for trafficking in people in the Chaco, which had a judicial ruling with a 15 -year prison sentence for its top leader and the other leader committed suicide. Citing specific cases, he also intended to involve other trade union and social organizations, hitting all.
  </p>
<p>
   We want and work for the truth, but we are not going to allow us to defam us, get dirty and condemn, with a political and media complaint, for a judicial act that must be investigated.
  </p>
<p>
   Never mainly national media were spent so much time to issues that involve native peoples, when we are killed, missing, abused and discriminated against in the Chaco, as now when it is accused.
  </p>
<p>
   The deployment of the operation of more than 250 police officers from several locations, with members of the mounted and motorized, dozen mobile and troops with hood, is an obvious message with which it is intended to intimidate, frighten and discipline a fighting organization to an organization of struggle and with thousands of natives.
  </p>
<p>
   We regret the participation of the Governor of the Province in that type of attack. He knows very well that he does not correspond that we attack his party, accusing him of
   <em>
    "Illicit association, negotiations incompatible with public function, illicit enrichment, fraud to the detriment of public administration, breach of duties and aggravated money laundering."
   </em>
   These are some of the foundations of the oral trial that will resume in our province in the next few days, against a former mayor of Resistencia, to which he knows very well, for having been his chief of cabinet. Perhaps he believes that acting as in the press conference, "you will see a horizon" that a few days ago did not see.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    There is another way to defend the majority of the people of Chaco
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   We believe that he is wrong, if he really wants to prevent taxes from our regional economy, not to skip the fee of electricity, water and transport, becoming unpayable. If you do not want the Chaco without works to be and fundamentally and dramaticly, it is without the small contribution fee to a hunger feed that grows incontestable in the province with the highest national poverty rate, it should rely on that town that increases its suffering and should claim with courage, as other governors and mayors are doing, to avoid dispossession, before it is late.
  </p>
<p>
   We will follow that path, summoning the unity of the entire Chaco people, as we did with the multisectoral march of regional economies to Plaza de Mayo in November 2016, before whom he defended the powerful as today. We will feel the voice of deep Argentina, against hunger, adjustment, repression, for sovereignty and federalism.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    The previous crisis that led to this
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   At the end of 2001, when she was president of the Rúa and Minister of Labor Patricia Bullrich, inflation, adjustment, delivery and confiscation of savers' deposits in the banks grew. The fed up and anger increased in the town that won the streets to the shout of "picket and saucepan, the fight is only one." They decreed the state of siege, causing popular rebellion.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Those who did it, did not pay it
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   They repressed wildly killing 39 people, mostly in Plaza de Mayo. De la Rúa resigned and left by helicopter. Bullrich went to wait for his new moment and did not yield, nor paid anything.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Why are there social plans?
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Hunger grew at unknown levels and after a succession of 5 presidents in 11 days, where Rodríguez Saá suspended the payment of the external debt that bleed Enraged by not having to eat, for the repression and appropriation of your savings. He tried to placate, which could be put on everything.
  </p>
<p>
   To the social organizations and movements that had been fighting hunger, dozens of new ones were added and grew in each province and in the country. There were no plans for all and was defined as a distribution criteria, which were obtained by those who had fought for them most, with decisions taken in assemblies.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Those responsible for the numbers of shame
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   From that date to the present, different governments followed, but the sources of work that were ending with the need for the plans were not created. On the contrary, the Macri government, where Bullrich had its new moment, exceeded the duplication of the number of plans, because its policy led to the bankruptcy more than 25 thousand small and medium enterprises, increasing the people who remained in the street again.
  </p>
<p>
   Today the number of unemployed and informal that need a plan or unemployment insurance, is 8 million people and the plans to enhance work are 1 million 200 thousand. It is paid for $ 78,000, when the indigence line in Le Chaco is at $ 304,000. The plan of the plan goes to each beneficiary that charges it by card per bank and spends it in the businesses of its neighborhood or its locality.
  </p>
<p>
   We do not want plans, we want formal work, with retirement contributions, family salary, social work and all the rights conquered in 100 years of struggle of the labor movement and that today wants to trample with the DNU.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Our jobs
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Each movement has its particularity of organization and work. We work by elaborating bread, bricks, orchards, farms, production of ecological cotton, textile, housing construction or roof service, sidewalks, drains, goalkeepers, school cleaning, health centers and fully precarious hospitals, school support, weeding of paths and schools and snacks indispensable for three times a week, almost as the only food. The sacrificed participation of thousands of women during the pandemic was key, for the care, elaboration of chins, manufacture of alcohol in gel and keep the snacks as the only food, when Bullrich cut streets burning chinies. The communities and the mayors are witnesses of this, but from the national government and unfortunately of the province, it is intended to delegitimize and criminalize the organizations, to advance the adjustment. It turns out that now the "caste" is us.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Unoccupied organizations should not exist, because there should be no unemployment and informality
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   There are because the different governments did not create the necessary sources of work to incorporate us and if they do not and want to resolve the distribution directly of the plans from the government, it is not difficult. They must do as with the AUH universal assignment per child. That is universal for all unoccupied, as in other countries that take an example for other things. The organizations, which they call "intermediaries", exist because there are not for everyone and the people seek to join and organize to fight to achieve at least that.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Who gets part of the silver of the Argentines scratching the navel?
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   The amount destined to pay social plans is 10% of the amount that is destined to pay the interests of large financial speculators and banks, which put their money in the Leliqs, doing anything. They sit down to wait for 120% average annual annual, scratching and they take it outside. Now the government intends to ask for loans to dollarize that debt, which we all pay for all. We will contribute to the unity of the Argentine people, to avoid it.

   At 89, our beloved partner Jorge Risi died.
  </p>
<p>
   Roque, as we all knew him, joined our party since its foundation, having been in the FJC with which he broke along with thousands of young people.
  </p>
<p>
   He played in different organization tasks, in the dictatorship he did it as responsible for the press task, and in recent years as responsible for the National Sports Commission.
  </p>
<p>
   Roque was a true communist who fought his whole life to realize the historical objective of the working class, society without exploiters or exploited.
  </p>
<p>
   Dear Roque until victory, always!
  </p>
<p>
   We will say goodbye Wednesday, February 21, 15hs, at the Chacarita crematorium.

   Comrade Lenin, the leading light of the international proletariat and a great teacher of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, highlights the way for the unit for the international communist movement

   It is we who form the great proletarian strategist, comrade Lenin's army. Nothing is higher than the honor of belonging to this army. ”
  </strong>
  (Stalin)
 </p>
<p>
  As the story shows, on January 21, 1924, Comrade Lenin became the great leader of the working class and the oppressed peoples in the world, the other great milestone for Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, immortal and left behind a great legacy of incomprehensible value. Comrade Lenin's teachings, which transformed the "world of the future", whose basics were laid by Marx and Engels, from an abstract opportunity for a concrete reality, is still fully relevant after a century of major upheavals in the world. In order to position yourself correctly in the class struggle, one must accept this "timeliness" and orient yourself after it. At the same time, this "timeliness" is a cure for reformist, revisionist and parliamentary cretinism, which means capitulation and compromise with ruling ideologies of all kinds. It is the guarantee of faith and determination that a communist world can be created.

<strong>
   Lenin as a teacher in communism who broke IS and paved the way to international reaction and revisionism
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  Properly identifying the contradictions in the history of the class struggle, understanding the moments of historical crimes and being ready in these times was the most prominent element of comrade Lenin's entire struggle until his immortality. After Marx and Engel's death, the leadership of the international proletariat was taken over for a long time by the second international opportunism, and in the word of comrade Stalin:
  <strong>
   "A period when others
  </strong>
<strong>
   I
  </strong>
<strong>
   the parties of the nternational were not
  </strong>
<strong>
   able to
  </strong>
<strong>
   Take over the theoretical struggle to free the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world from the influence of these opportunistic and class compromising social democrats. In addition to the theoretical struggle for the liberation of the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples in the world, with the founding of Communist
  </strong>
<strong>
   I
  </strong>
<strong>
   He developed the International a form of organization and struggle adapted to the dynamics of the class struggle during the new period of capitalism. "
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin turned the Communist Party and the Communist International into an instrument for war against the bourgeoisie by liberating the Communist Party and the Communist International's movement from the buoys of legal forms of fighting:
  <strong>
   “Instead of revolutionary politics - dehydrated toblorerism and snus -widely politicizing, parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary combinations. For the sake of, of course, 'revolutionary' decisions were made and adopted 'revolutionary' slogan ... '
  </strong>
  But as it "stores in the drawers", freed from legal forms of struggle.
  <strong>
   “However, a new stage of imperialist war and the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat was approaching. The old fighting methods proved to be manifestly insufficient and powerless towards the omnipotance of financial capital. It was necessary to revise the entire international work, all of its working method, to expel the tobogganing, narrow -mindedness, politicization, the overflow, social chauvinism and social pacifism. It was necessary to try the entire international Arsenal, to throw out all rusty and murky and forge new weapons. Without such preparatory work, it would be worthless to go out in the field against capitalism. Without this, the proletariat risked suddenly to face new revolutionary affects without being sufficiently equipped or even completely uneven. The honor of this general examination and general cleansing of the second international Augiasstall fell on the lot of Leninism. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin, the basics of Leninism)
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin, with his genius, took the core of the contradiction and realized that the fight against the bourgeoisie cannot be sufficiently effective and successful without shaking off the burdens that weigh on the back of the international proletariat, without fighting revisionism and opportunism, without showing the masses the true nature of these Opinions in theory and practice, without isolating them as far as possible. By establishing the dialectical and necessary link between the "internal struggle" and the "outer struggle", he fought the double struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin gave us communists the extremely important lesson that the fight against revisionism and opportunism cannot be separated from the fight against imperialism and all forms of governing reactions. On the contrary, the fight against imperialism must be cleared from revisionism and opportunism.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Keep high Lenin's teachings within the intersecting contradiction of the imperialist system
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  The imperialist system, which comrade Lenin analyzed in detail in the early 1900s, has survived during the past period, but its contradictions are tightened and it is in a spiral of insoluble antagonistic contradictions. Although the resolution of the Soviet Union and the integration process in the capitalist system that China went through prevented the contradictions from exploding for a while, the law on the unequal development of capitalism continued and the interimperistic rivalry developed at the stage of "resolution". with regional war. This shows which crisis system is in and that the previous "solutions" no longer work. The imperialists, who for a long time maintained their crisis by moving the system's burdens to the semi -colonies and deepening the looting of the semi -colonies, has also ended up in a dead end.
 </p>
<p>
  One of the explosive points in the inherent problems of the imperialist system, which has been developed in accordance with Lenin's definition of imperialism is that the interim materialist struggle, which has been shown in various forms in recent years, is currently being fought in regional war. When Lenin listed the contradictions of imperialism, he mentioned the interimmeristic contradiction as one of the three most important contradictions.
 </p>
<p>
  We can see that the development is in line with comrade Lenin's observations on the nature and contradictions of imperialism:
  <strong>
   “The second contradiction is the contradiction between the various financial groups and imperialist powers in their struggle for raw material sources, about foreign areas. Imperialism involves capital exports to the raw material sources, a furious struggle for the monopoly possession of these sources, struggle for the already divided world's new division, a struggle as new financial groups and powers in search of a 'place in the sun' with special rage against the old groups and powers, which Stubbornly clinging to the prey. This furious struggle between the different capitalist groups is remarkable to such an extent that one of its inevitable elements is imperialist war, war for the conquest of foreign areas. This circumstance is, in turn, remarkable that it leads to the mutual weakening of the imperialists, to a weakening of the position of capitalism in general, to the speed of the proletarian revolution, to the practical necessity of this Revolution. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin, Leninism's basics).
 </p>
<p>
  Russia and China, the former socialist countries that have given the imperialist system a respite with their new markets, have become the main actors in the interim materialist rivalry, in violation of hegemonic power the United States. This means that the scope and nature of the contradictions has increased as new and powerful players are gaining increasing commitment to the fight for redistribution of territories. The great confrontation with Russian imperialism's invasion of Ukraine took place against this background. It is predictable that this tendency will be further deepened and spread further. As long as there is no direct confrontation between the imperialists, the areas where the split wars are carried out half colonies and colonies. The half -colonies and the oppressed peoples in the world will continue to pay the price for these wars until the imperialists declare direct war against each other.
 </p>
<p>
  With this
  <em>
   the division of the world into a handful of imperialist nations and a majority of oppressed countries
  </em>
  - Masterly analyzed by Lenin - deepens even more. The third contradictions are tightened with the imperialist looting, and the semi -colonial and semi -feodal increase in powerful national liberation war and folk war that shakes the imperialist system.
 </p>
<p>
  Parallel to the process where imperialism goes under contradictions, the interimplyistic and the contradiction imperialist countries and oppressed people and nations; All parts of the governing system, especially the imperialist states, become more centralized, militaristic and warlike than before, which paves the way for all fascist emotions to bring society into a corresponding ideological format. This is met either by so -called right -wing extremists or under the veil of social democratic or liberal parties. Communists and the oppressed peoples in the world, in front of the reality of a system that every day becomes more reactionary and aggressive, needs a Leninist party to lead the proletariat's struggle for political power, as comrade Lenin outlined, to organize a strong opposition to this reaction. Only such a party, today a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, can lead an irreconcilable fight against the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Lenin's great heritage, the party's Leninist design: The Fight Stab of the Proletariat
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
<strong>
   A revolution is not a dinner party or like writing an essay or painting a painting or embroidery. It cannot be particularly refined, particularly quiet and mild, especially moderate, friendly, polite, mastered or magnificent. A revolution is a rebellion, a act of violence, where one class crashes another.
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong).
 </p>
<p>
  It is crucial how the communists define the existing contradictions and how they position themselves before the development. During the hundreds that have passed since comrade Lenin's death, the imperialists have transformed their governing structures into even larger war machines. Their armies, police officers, intelligence services etc. are equipped with capacity that is incomparable to the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of those who call themselves "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignore this reality (although it seems theoretically accepted) and is far from positioning itself accordingly. But by following an ideological and practical reconciliation line that locks the working class and the oppressed masses in the governing system, they dampen the anger of the masses and act as a breakwater. While the imperialists and the governance's governing structures are equating themselves with increasingly violent appliances and institutions, it is necessary as supporters of comrade Lenin, to keep a strong ideological struggle against the fact that those who define themselves as "revolutionaries" and "communists" go further further And further away from reality that the revolution and the revolutionary struggle will be based on weapons and violence. Taking Comrade Lenin's relentless fight against the second international opportunism as a guide against these views is one of the important tasks to make comrade Lenin justice during the centenary of his immortality.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin defined the new type of Communist Party as the "proletariat's war organization". This definition was necessary because of the imperialist system and the mutual position of the classes. Both the process that led to the October Revolution and the Civil War that broke out with the October Revolution were the concrete reasons why Comrade Lenin called the Communist Party "The War Organization of the Proletariat". It is a necessity that the Communist Party, which will lead the liberation of the proletariat and the oppressed masses, has this property, while the counter -revolution armed from top to toe with the device's apparatus and means and commits all these terrible massacres against the working class and the oppressed peoples. A revolutionary war needs a fighting party to bring it. Only fools and indefinite auditors who rely on the bourgeoisie can see it differently.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Some people ridicule us as advocates of "the general of war". Yes, we advocate the omniption of the revolutionary war; It's good, not bad, it's Marxist. Russia's Communist Party's rifle created socialism. We will create a democratic republic. The experience of the class struggle during the era of imperialism teaches us that it is only with the power of the rifle that the working class and the working masses can defeat the bourgeoisie and the landlords, both of which are armed. In this sense, we can say that only with rifles can the whole world be transformed.
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong).
 </p>
<p>
  At its founding conference, IKF defined the constituency and reconstitution of the communist parties as an important task in the struggle for the proletarian world revolution. The understanding of the Communist Party developed by Comrade Mao Zedong is in line with the understanding of the Communist Party that Comrade Lenin outlined and also enriched by Stalin, and is the realization of the Leninist understanding of the party in Marxism-Leninism-Maoism's ideology. During the period of imperialism and proletarian revolutions in which we are located, the Communist Party that is capable of opposing the growing imperialist reaction and leading the proletariat and the oppressed peoples in the world must have the quality of being the "proletariat's war organization".
 </p>
<p>
  An essential heritage from Lenin is the question of political power as the fundamental issue for each revolution. Lenin showed how
  <strong>
   "The proletarian revolution is impossible without the violent destruction of the bourgeois state machinery and without being replaced with a new"
  </strong>
  and how
  <strong>
   ”ut
  </strong>
<strong>
   an
  </strong>
<strong>
   Power is
  </strong>
<strong>
   everything
  </strong>
<strong>
   in illusion ”
  </strong>
  . Under Lenin's personal leadership of the world's first socialist state, the dictatorship of the proletariat was established, which specified the proletarian path to power and to maintain it.
 </p>
<p>
  After Lenin's death, it was his sequel Stalin who brilliantly defined Leninism, developed it and made it the foundation for the entire international communist movement. Based on the great Lenin's shoulders, chairman Mao was able to bring the proletarian world revolution to higher heights and develop the ideology of the proletariat. Leninism that is today Marxism-Leninism-Maoism must be embraced, defended and applied today.
 </p>
<p>
  As IKF, we will continue to perform the tasks that the great Lenin brought up and benefit from the legacy that Comrade Lenin has left to us.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin, the great teachers of international proletariat and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism lead and guide our struggle for the proletarian world revolution today as he did yesterday!
