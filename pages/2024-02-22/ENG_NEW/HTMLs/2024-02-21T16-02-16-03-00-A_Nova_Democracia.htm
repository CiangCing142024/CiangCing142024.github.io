 <p>
  There are scholars, such as historian Oscar Conde, who report that Lunfardo, contrary to what the bourgeoisie often says, was more than a significant manner of “criminals” that emerged between the 1800s and 1900s in Argentina, and that remains alive.
 </p>
 <p>
  It would be a variation
  <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialecto" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  of
  <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imigrante" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  , proletarians, workers, mainly
  <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianos" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

  , which settled among the poor classes of the capital

   Buenos Aires
  </a>
  and its periphery.
 </p>
 <p>
  A rebellious, cunning and winding way to speak, one more way to defend and resist the oppressive classes.
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The incomprehensible and maradona
 </h4>
 <p>
  Colloquially, it is called lump.
 </p>
 <p>
  In practical terms it is unintelligible even to Spanish average speakers from other countries. "El Pibe de Oro", nicknamed by Maradona, belongs to the lunfa and means "The Pivete (boy) of gold."
 </p>
 <p>
  The proletarian language also includes, among others, a particular way of speaking by reversing the syllables of a word, called “Vesre”, the opposite of “setback (otherwise” in Castilian). So you have
  <em>
   tango
  </em>
  replaced for
  <em>
   gotan
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   amigo
  </em>
  by
  <em>
   gom,
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   colo
  </em>
  by
  <em>
   loco
  </em>
  ,etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Lunfardo had a great influence on Brazilian slang, notably in the ports of Praça Mauá (
  <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro_(estado)" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Rio de Janeiro
  </a>
  ) e
  <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For the
  <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Brazil
  </a>
  Words came like
  <em>
   sucker,
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Bacana, mine, phonate, scolding, fake
  </em>
  .

  A rebellion and a game
 </h4>
 <p>
  So Oscar Conde clarified in an interview of 2018:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Lunfardo is a unique linguistic phenomenon.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a term to be Lunfardo has to be present an idea of rebellion and an idea of 'playing/playing' with language.
 </p>
 <p>
  When Lunfardo comes, it does it almost like a
  <em>
   socioleto
  </em>
  of the popular classes. That is, it is a speech of the mouth of the poor, the disqualified, the inhabitants of the tenement/favela, the suburb.
 </p>
 <p>
  Originally it was a speech of these popular classes, where there was a lot of immigrant. I would say, however, that in the 1940s Lunfardo is already a polyclassist and crosses all ages. Currently, a person who started using Lunfardo when he was 10 years old, today is 60 and continues to speak him. ”
 </p>
 <h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  A little of the word
 </h4>
 <p>
  Following are some terms practiced in the lunfa:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Bacán
   </em>
  </strong>
  (similar to cool, in Brazil) -
 </p>
 <p>
  The one who has money in a bank (
  <em>
   bank
  </em>
  In Castilian, therefore “Bancana” person). Individual looking rich or having good life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Related to this, we would have the word "bacchanal", being "bacán" an apocope. Thus, "Bacán" would be the person given to good life, travel, designer clothes, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, for some, the etymology would proceed from Italy, the old genoese language, from the jabra now unused "baccan" with the meaning of boss, owner of the house/farm, owner or chief of ship that as a sign of command was carrying a staff called " Bacco ”(something like“ staff ”in Portuguese).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Cana –
   </em>
  </strong>
  Police. Such a Lunfarda word seems to be the abbreviation of “Canary”, a word already used in Spain since the 1500s at least (Miguel de Cervantes, author of the classic “Don Quixote de La Mancha”, mentions it with the meaning of
  <em>
   cantor
  </em>
  ,
  <em>
   Police whistleblower or confidant).
  </em>
  Others assume that etymologia is on the French Palha
  <em>
   cane
  </em>
  ("Sugarcane", "stick"), alluding to the club used by police.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Gato –
   </em>
  </strong>
  This word is one of the demonstrations of the "sliding" of
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/wiki/significado" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   meaning
  </a>
  that exists in Lunfardo, given in part by changes of historical contexts.Ex: Until Early 1980
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  It used to be a compliment to someone very agile or shrewd (the musician
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Astor_Piazzolla&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Astor Piazzolla
  </a>
  For his great talent when playing Bandoneón, the main instrument in the tango, was nicknamed “El Gato”). However, there were times when it was common to call
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  customers of the most beautiful and luxurious/expensive harlots, as well as the prostitutes themselves, called
  <em>
   toga
  </em>
  In Vesre.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sliding again, among the poor class
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  He then became adjective to qualify the stupid foolish person. However, in provinces of the Argentine interior, as
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=provincia_de_Santiago_del_Estero&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Santiago del Estero or Tucuman
  </a>
  <em>
   gato
  </em>
  It applies to thieves because they have “easy nail to steal”. In Brazil it is similar.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Mina –
   </em>
  </strong>
  Woman. Initially it was used with pejorative connotations. It is a lunfa word that forms with the
  <a href="https://es.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Af%C3%A9resis_(fon%C3%A9tica)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">

  with meaning similar to scoundrel/bad character/infamous/unworthy/vile.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it was taking through the twentieth century parallel meanings, such as in the area of B.Aires the praise of “sympathetic picaro”, “Fun Frauder”, “Pleasant Trickster”.
