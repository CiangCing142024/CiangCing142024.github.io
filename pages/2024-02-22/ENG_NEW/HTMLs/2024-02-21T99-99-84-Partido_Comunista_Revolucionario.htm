    Talk organized by the JCR de Rosario
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   Within the framework of the five years of the departure of Otto Vargas, first general secretary of our beloved revolutionary communist party, a talk was held on Friday 16 in Rosario a talk that had as its protagonists the last three general secretaries of the revolutionary communist youth: Luciano Orellano (2005-2010); Pablo Landó (2010-2016) and Luciano Álvarez (from 2016 to the present), who shared their experiences and learning together with him, fundamental today for the fight against the antipopular and anti-national policy of the government of Javier Milei.
  </p>
  <p>
   On September 3, 1929 in Choele Choel, Río Negro, the most rebel of all was born: Otto César Vargas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The tribute was also present in the great work of his works written at a table that gathered all literature materials.
  </p>
  <p>
   Luciano Orellano, the first to direct the word, emphasized the life and work of Otto and the importance of having traveled those countries of the world in which the socialist revolutions had triumphed - who would visit Germany with him in 2006 - and in the great Outto's transcendence as a picture of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism at the international level. He also mentioned Patriots such as General San Martín, Mariano Moreno, Juana Azurduy, Manuel Belgrano, José Gervasio Artigas and spoke of Otto's integration with Argentine reality, which cannot be understood without a deep knowledge of our history and our reality . He stressed that Otto was the son of a generation that saw how the Red Army defeated the Nazis and nailed the red flag. The living experience that all our action is a cry of war against imperialism. And he concluded that "Otto is a need for every day, of all those who want to find the path of the revolution in Argentina."
  </p>
  <p>
   Pablo Landó, in turn, stressed that Otto was fully convinced of the importance of the study and that the JCR can be mass and when culture and sport were worked. He referred to the history of clubs in Argentina and the deep ideological burden that sports and cultural work has and that is above all a closed fact for thousands and thousands of kids and kids in Argentina. "The best tribute we can do to Otto is to continue raising the flags of the revolution, starting from the conviction that none of the structural problems will be solved without a revolutionary exit and I have no doubt that we will succeed" .
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, Luciano Álvarez, general secretary of the Revolutionary Communist Youth, highlighted in his words the importance of the activity in relation to talking about Otto is talking about the history of the party, talking about who we are, talking about communism and Fight for the revolution, which was for what fought until the end of his days. “Many times the communists gave us the dead, the ruling classes said they had buried communism, but what also demonstrated life and history is that every time we died, the communists returned and we have a present And let's fight. We have a great responsibility and legacy that Otto left us, which has to do with fighting to guarantee the historical continuity of a line of proletarian hegemony that can play a role from the point of view of the triumph of the revolution in Argentina and that has to See with defending with all the line of the game. ” And finally he added that "the story of Otto Vargas has not finished writing, because a communist, a revolutionary is not judged only by what he has done throughout his militant life, but for what he leaves" .
  </p>
  <p>
   In a full room, with the enthusiasm of validity, conviction and revolutionary passion that otto brings us, this sense tribute closed with everyone chanting in a loud voice: «They all scream, shout strong, Otto Vargas even Victory always!".
