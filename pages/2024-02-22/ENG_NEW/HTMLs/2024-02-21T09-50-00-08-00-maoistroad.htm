  The German imperialist bourgeoisie is feverishly preparing for war. The initiator of the 1st and 2nd imperialist wars, German imperialism is working intensively to become the central base and wage the 3rd World War.
21 February 2024

The Western bourgeoisie, especially the political and military spokespersons of the German imperialist monopolies, sleep with war and wake up with war. Especially since Russia's attack on Ukraine, all their efforts have been to shape the economy according to the war, while arms production has become one of their urgent tasks to prepare the military power for a new imperialist war.
On 16-18 February 2024, the 60th Munich Security Conference (MGK) will be held in Munich, Germany. They are organising a conference where imperialist bandits, arms monopolies will talk about bargaining, preparing for war, how to maximise arms production and military power, and how to plan domestic fascistisation by destroying democratic rights and freedoms.
Of course, the negotiations for the protection of the interests of all imperialist bandit representatives, their own countries and monopolies will be made at the highest level. The war lobby of all imperialist countries will be at this conference. In short, besides the fact that the NSC is one of the places where the imperialist monopolies negotiate to share the world, this year's conference is likely to be even more contentious and in an environment where threats are thrown because it is held in an environment where polarisation is sharpening.
This conference coincided with the start of NATO's five-month-long exercise called "Unshakable Defence", in which about 90,000 troops from 31 NATO members and the candidate country Sweden will participate. It is obvious that this exercise is a preparatory and offensive exercise against Russia. Germany will again be the military base of this exercise for five months.
In addition to being the economic motor power of Europe, Germany also wants to be the military motor power and is preparing accordingly. The Chancellor Scholz, the Minister of Defence, the Chief of the General Staff, the Minister of the Interior, the Chairman of the National Security Council, all of them are talking about preparing for war and shaping the economy for war. This is not enough, they also want society to be shaped according to the war. While Germany is preparing its economy and society for the imperialist war, it is preparing the EU countries for the war in the same way.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg wants to send more weapons to Ukraine. He proposes turning the EU economy into a war economy. He emphasises that this is urgent. And he adds that it would be useful for Europe to be ready for a conflict with Russia, "possibly lasting decades".
"We have to get used to the idea that there could be a threat of war in Europe, and that means we have to be ready for war," said German Defence Minister Pistorius.
Germany's Chief of the General Staff, Carsten Breuer, also told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the German Army "should be ready for war" within five years, "This does not mean that there will be a war, but it is a possibility."

 Germany, Denmark and Poland, who attended the opening of the new ammunition production factory of the imperialist Rheinmetall monopoly, which profited the most from the Ukraine-Russia war (it is more realistic to say NATO-Russia war) and increased its capital many times over, gave messages that arms production in Europe should be increased rapidly. This shows that the German economy is being redesigned according to the war.
The German imperialist bourgeoisie is feverishly preparing for war. The initiator of the 1st and 2nd imperialist wars, German imperialism is working intensively to become the central base and wage the 3rd World War.
Poland has signed a 'military Schengen' agreement with Germany and the Netherlands.[1]
"The Weimar Triangle was held at Saint-Cloud near Paris with the participation of French, German and Polish leaders."[2]
The European bourgeoisie has long been looking for ways to act independently of the USA. The preparations for imperialist war play a facilitating role for new imperialist unions or blocs (sub-blocs). Nevertheless, for the time being the EU bourgeoisie is aware that it cannot act independently of the USA. However, it continues to increase its economic and military power based on Germany.
With this awareness, the German bourgeoisie is trying to further increase its own influence and dominance in the EU and wants to assume the role of the military and economic saviour of the EU and to bring the EU countries under its wing with the discourse of "Russian threats".
While the German bourgeoisie is preparing for a new imperialist war, while militarising its economy, it is of course taking domestic fascisation along with it. While continuing to polarise society on the basis of xenophobia, it does not hesitate to enact fascist and anti-democratic laws.
Some of the monopolies, together with the Christian Democratic Party (CDU), are preparing the fascist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as the future government. The reason for the CDU's involvement is that they know that if the AfD alone were to come to power there would be a strong reaction. They are trying to familiarise society with the fascist party.
Nevertheless, the anti-fascist anger of the masses is great. In the last month, more than 4 million people took part in anti-fascist mass demonstrations in 500 cities in Germany. Anti-fascist demonstrations and rallies are still going on. However, the liberal war-ready government is trying to pacify and deflect these demonstrations.
The German bourgeoisie is once again appearing on the scene as an imperialist war-making force. History does not repeat itself, but due to the character of imperialism, the biggest imperialist countries are never left behind in the war for world domination or for a larger share of the markets. The fact that they suffered heavy defeats in previous wars does not mean that they have learnt the right lessons. The imperialist bourgeoisie can never avoid imperialist aggression and war in the war for hegemony. Even if the possible war will bring greater destruction than the previous ones. Although German imperialism was the initiator of the 1st and 2nd imperialist wars, it will not hesitate to start the 3rd one. Its present preparations are accordingly.
Imperialist wars can be prevented. This can only be possible if all anti-fascist, anti-imperialist war forces, especially the working class, strengthen their unity and raise their struggle.
On the one hand, the German bourgeoisie polarises society on the basis of hostility to immigrants, on the other hand they know that they cannot do without immigrants. This is because capitalism is unable to produce a labour force. Nevertheless, the bourgeoisie is trying to polarise and divide the working class through xenophobia and prolong the life of their bloody power.
In fact, all these indicators show that the imperialist system has come to an end and they will not see another century. Because the accumulation and centralisation of capital and the increase in impoverishment and the consequent destruction of democratic rights and freedoms are directly linked to each other.
Here communists have a historic task: Communists must lead the masses against imperialist war and fascism and, accordingly, pursue tactics to unite all anti-imperialist anti-war and anti-fascist forces.
In addition to this, the real liberation of the masses will come through socialism and the perspective of socialism must be presented. The working class and oppressed peoples are not pessimistic. We must not forget that imperialist wars lead to socialism. The working class has nothing to lose but its chains. But it has a huge world to gain.
