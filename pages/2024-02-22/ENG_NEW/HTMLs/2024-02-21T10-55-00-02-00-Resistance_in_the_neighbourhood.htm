   Love and war the two elements quarrel
   <br/>
   They do not fight with tanks with swords and cannons
   <br/>
   Only wakes love with the little wings
   <br/>
   He touches his boogie and does the war:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - I'm not afraid of a city, and let's be armored.
   <br/>
   I have the sunshine, and the moon brothers.
   <br/>
   I am the edge of life and the beginning of the world.
   <br/>
   They match my eye on the contrary they have.
   <br/>
   I sow with my shutches the vigor and forests.
   <br/>
   I sow beautiful and male warriors,
   <br/>
   And as you crumble and spoil, I will always be in front of you.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - Baby bastard, don't be deceived!
   <br/>
   I spread out my handle and catalyze if I want
   <br/>
   To idea what the beginning and the beginning of the world is.
   <br/>
   Your job is that you nourish me, law that you feed me
   <br/>
   <br/>
   - We will come a day of city, sit down in your cave
   <br/>
   And to be the day of May to flood the sun
   <br/>
   As we measure the two together, in the green meadows!
   <br/>
   And to be a crowd of people, Zerva, Right and our umbrella
   <br/>
   With Peace the swords, the sneakers of love
   <br/>
   To see how life begins and how the law changes.
   <br/>
   Myriad will be the disabled and the unknown soldiers
   <br/>
   And the sailors and the engineers and their belovers,
   <br/>
   With the tail of dolphin, with the wings on the shoulders
   <br/>
   And the kids of Icarus, with the winds of the wind.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With Lambrakis leader and with Belogiannis
   <br/>
   And with the son of nun, Diako and Mars
   <br/>
   With Antipa Teacher and Daskalogiannis
   <br/>
   And Androutsos the summer, which we were in the earth and the world
   <br/>
   And from afar Bolivar along with Guevara
   <br/>
   Rosa and Spartacus and with Soukatzidis
   <br/>
   With Cornaro Hugo and with Mayakovsky
   <br/>
   With Electra, Mando and Bouboulina
   <br/>
   And with Passionaria with Duruti
   <br/>
   Bibba the legendary, legendary Kistakis
   <br/>
   And still the lion -hearted Iro Constantopoulou
   <br/>
   And her second mother, Lela Karagiannis.
   <br/>
   And with Martin Luther King and Patrice Lumumba
   <br/>
   And Sarafi General and Nikiforidis
   <br/>
   <br/>
   But also with the tragic Ploumbidis-Zachariadis
   <br/>
   With Sotiris Petroula and with Diomedes
   <br/>
   Michalakis Karaolis and Palikaridis
   <br/>
   And teachers teacher, Nikos Temponera
   <br/>
   And with the Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet and still
   <br/>
   With the ghost child and with Katerina
   <br/>
   <br/>
   With first and foremost walking walking
   <br/>
   Master of the master the beautiful woman
   <br/>
   Whole and proud and brownish
   <br/>
   To get out of her rum
   <br/>
   But zerva and more right and other umbrella and back
   <br/>
   For the peoples to pass, the nobles tremble.
   <br/>
   Both the generals and the admirals and the traders of discord
   <br/>
   With you, eternal prison in the thick darkness.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This is not a dream, it is a tragic celebration
   <br/>
   And I will be the festival, the magician and the magician
   <br/>
   See what the beginning and the beginning of the world is
   <br/>
   Why we don't bother you anymore yes you get out of youth,
   <br/>
   Eat the world of the world ...
