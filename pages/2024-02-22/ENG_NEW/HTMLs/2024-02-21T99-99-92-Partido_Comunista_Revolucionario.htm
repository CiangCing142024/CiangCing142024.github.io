   The National Government, chaired by Javier Milei, in just over two months has greatly deepened the sufferings of the Argentine people. The growth of inflation has led us to lose much of the purchasing power of our salaries. Thousands of teachers and also our students and their families, we are the ones who pay the consequences of low salaries with a school basket that has risen 450% the last year and with the brutal increase in transport.
  </p>
  <p>
   The National Government takes anti -government and anti -democratic measures enriching a “caste” of monopolies and landowners who are behind the drafting of their decrees, bills and economic measures. And religiously pay an illegitimate, usurative and fraudulent external debt contracted by its macrista partners as the current Minister of Economy Luis Caputo.
  </p>
  <p>
   The federal nature of our country overwhelms the provinces, particularly to the province of Buenos Aires, shrinking the items of federal co -participation and cutting the transfer of discretionary funds and subsidies to transport and services. Now, as part of its measures against the people and the country, it has decided to stop turning the budget items for education to each province: the National Teaching Incentive Fund (FONID), Connectivity, Salary Compensation Fund and other education items ( Pedagogical programs, school canteens and milk cup, progress, connect equality and school infrastructure). It also eliminates the institutional improvements of technical schools and budgetary lines, which are fundamental for its operation. And refuses to convene the National Teaching Parity.
  </p>
  <p>
   President Milei's false argument is that education "is a problem of the governors of each province", denying articles 14 and 14 bis of the National Constitution, among others, when their measures hit the people, forgetting that the funds of the funds of the that appropriate were also generated in each province, by the men and women who produce wealth in Argentina and who are now victims of their measures.
  </p>
  <p>
   The pockets are also filled in the province of Buenos Aires many of those who direct the national government in the shadows, such as Paolo Rocca de Techint, Elsztain de Cresud and Irsa, Galperin de Mercado Libre, to name just a few.
  </p>
  <p>
   In that context, the Government of the Province of Buenos Aires summoned the teaching parity he offered, according to the FUDB: “20% of the general average of increase on the basis of calculation December 2023, as of February 1, 2024 This increase will also be perceived by retired. In addition, he reported that he will increase the sections of family assignments. ” At a time that by the measures of Milei we will stop receiving in our salary what corresponds to the nation of Fonid, connectivity and compensatory fund.
  </p>
  <p>
   We understand that this increase is insufficient. We come from the devaluation of Milei in December, where an interannual inflation of 211.4%was closed. In the parity of that month, a 2023 increase of 153%was established by provincial decree, with respect to the Salary Dic ’22, which generated an important salary loss.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with the denial of the National Teaching Joint and establishing the minimum, vital and mobile salary, the provincial government agreed to the request of the unions: parity every month, that the increases are also perceived by the retirees and retirees and the increase in Family assignments. So that the teachers are not those who pay the adjustment, we need a salary increase that allows us at least to recover all the lost salary, and then win inflation.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is also necessary to unite the teachers, the educational community, the people and the Buenos Aires government, in the fight against the theft made by the national government of the provincial funds and our salaries.
  </p>
  <p>
   To turn that situation we propose:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    That the CTARA Congress promotes the non -start of classes throughout the country, and a progressive struggle plan, in response to confiscation by the National Government of Educational Funds and the refusal to convene the National Teaching Joint.
   </li>
   <li>
    In the province of Buenos Aires, compensate for the removal of resources, advancing with a mandatory contribution by the richest sectors of the province, as was the extraordinary contribution to the great fortunes. Initiative that was already promoted at the national level during the government of the front of all, given the crisis situation caused by the pandemic.
   </li>
   <li>
    With these funds, finance fair salaries to teachers and state and increase the educational budget for school food, infrastructure, scholarships, useful, sneakers, overalls, etc.
   </li>
   <li>
    Fight in the streets, together with the educational community and the people, in the widest unity, from the multisectoral, claiming the National Government of late federal co -participation, discretionary transfers and educational funds as part of the struggle initiatives we have for in front, which have as its main objective, turn the 70/23 hunger and delivery DNU.
   </li>
   <li>
    We reaffirm that education is a right and not an essential service.
   </li>
  </ol>
