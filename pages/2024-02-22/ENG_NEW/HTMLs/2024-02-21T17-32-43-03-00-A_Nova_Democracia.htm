Description: Lula's wave on the left in foreign policy - even shy, because in his pronouncements always recognizes Israel's right to defend himself against “Hamas Terrorism” - seeks to cover up his full delivery, in the internal, the large bourgeoisie, the large bourgeoisie, the large bourgeoisie place and imperialism.

  Everywhere, you notice the shouting of the swords' sketches the salary of the Zionist war counter -propaganda machine in Brazil. GloboNews journalist Guga Chacra said Luiz Inácio's lines - qualifying Israel's actions as genocide - are “anti -Semitic” demonstrations. The Israeli Confederation of Brazil (Conib) called Luiz Inacio's lines “wicked distortion of reality”. There are still others, who accuse the speech of the Brazilian agent of denying the Nazi Holocaust, of unintentionally in Israel's politics, and other aberrations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, Luiz Inacio said nothing much. However, the point is that even this is unacceptable to the Zionist bandits: they only accept cowardly and inverted capitulation to their dictates, like blood -thirsty dogs. They are really similar to the "bitch of fascism, which is always in heat." And in this, they rely on their counter -propaganda in Brazil, through this "brown press", whose war coverage is more Zionist than that made by the Israeli press itself.
 </p>
 <p>
  As for mr. Luiz Inácio, who demonstrates some practical consistency with his speech and

  Relationships immediately with Israel! Not only by recent episodes, regarding the Palestinian Holocaust - reason more than sufficient - but for the constant interference of Israel's diplomatic structures on Brazilian internal policy, such as the successive statements of Conib and its asclas, and also the Israeli ambassador himself himself , which made election campaign in 2022 for Bolsonaro and the far right, in direct confrontation with everything that respects national sovereignty; And also from the systematic espionage of Brazilians, as is proved with the appearance of milicos contracts headed by Heleno with the company Cognite, which not only offered araponging technology, but stored

  The data collected here, in a case of national betrayal that would blush Joaquim Silvério dos Reis.
 </p>
 <p>
  But Luiz Inácio won't do that. Its nod on foreign policy - even shy, because in its pronouncements always recognizes Israel's right to defend itself against “Hamas Terrorism” - seeks to cover its total delivery, in the internal level, the large bourgeoisie and the large local bourgeoisie and to imperialism. This is an old trick, which Lula has not invented: he is just copying the one used and abused by Jânio Quadros. Finally, the country's agent wanted to give the far-right stage on the inner plane, to politically revive Bolsonaro, to stay in the land as the “least worst”
