  More than 100 organizations and individuals under the No to Chacha Network gathered on February 15 to oppose the Marcos regime's plan to change the 1987 Constitution (Charter Change or Chacha), through any form. They also announced the commemoration of the 38th year of the EDSA uprising, which they said was the basis of the constitution.

  Instead of changing Chacha, groups and individuals calling for those in the position to raise wages and income, lowering prices of commodities and basic yutikiti, repairing social services, suppression of corruption and red tape (Long processes and queues in bureaucracy), promoting human rights, justice and peace, defending sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea, environmental protection and the assurance of clean and credible elections.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the gathering were national-democratic organizations, Congressmen of the National Block, members of the 1sta, former government official, church year, student group, teachers, other labor groups and much more. Also present were Justice Antonio Carpio, Commissioner Rene Sarmiento, Atty. Neri Colmenares, Sr. Mary John Mananzan, former DSWD Sec. Judy Taguiwalo, Bishop Gerardo Alminaza, Chairman of the One Negros Ecumenical Council (ONE-C) and Bishop of San Carlos City and many more.

  Meanwhile, various activities have been launched by various groups to oppose Chacha this month.

 <p>
  On Valentine's Day, farmers and women's Mendiola groups marched to Mendiola against the Rice Liberalization Law. They call: table food, not chacha!
 </p>
 <p>
  On February 16, the youth and students of the University Belt in Manila marched to express the opposition to the commercialization of education and the fight against the Marcos regime's long -standing chacha.
