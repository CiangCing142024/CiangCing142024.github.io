   At 89, our beloved partner Jorge Risi died.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roque, as we all knew him, joined our party since its foundation, having been in the FJC with which he broke along with thousands of young people.
  </p>
  <p>
   He played in different organization tasks, in the dictatorship he did it as responsible for the press task, and in recent years as responsible for the National Sports Commission.
  </p>
  <p>
   Roque was a true communist who fought his whole life to realize the historical objective of the working class, society without exploiters or exploited.
  </p>
  <p>
   Dear Roque until victory, always!
  </p>
  <p>
   We will say goodbye Wednesday, February 21, 15hs, at the Chacarita crematorium.
