 How much is the 
 life of a worker?
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How much are the 
 Lives of 5 workers?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How much are the 
 lives of hundreds of workers who only died in these first months 
 of the new year?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Nothing, for i 
 Masters are worth nothing.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One of the masters 
 who used the dead, injured migrants who risked their lives 
 At the Florence construction site, he also refused to respond not only 
 To the questions of journalists but anticipated the line that masters, 
 large and smallques, they have on this umpteenth massacre.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This gigantic 
 Florence construction site of the Esselunga contract was actually a jungle 
 of the contracts and subcontracts to the maximum reduction. It is clear that in 
 This chain the workers are the last ring, the victims 
 sacrificial, exploited, poorly paid and moreover killed if the accident, 
 Always on the horizon in this system, it takes place.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The responsibles 
 they are not difficult to identify, even in the pages of the newspapers 
 they find themselves: first of all the Caprotti family of Esselunga who 
 Just in these days you were cars promoting with books with which 
 He car incens him. A family that made great 
 profits and these profits made them on the skin of the workers, 
 of the workers, not only the direct ones who work in Esselunga, the 
 whose conditions have been under attention several times, but on the whole 
 Chain that leads to the situation and the massacre of Florence.

  The workers - of 
 One of them the body was found only after many days - you don't 
 They didn't even know who they were. These deaths are a piece of reality 
 very large in the working class, of the more working class 
 exploited that it is made up of many immigrants without residence permits 
 And in black.

 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These workers 
 They came from the Bergamo area, Brescia, they made long trips for 
 get to

 </p>
 <a name="more">

 Work. It is not well known even where they stayed in the 
 week of work before returning to their country.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two of them is 
 sure they didn't even have the residence permit that placed them 
 in conditions of having to accept any job to bring bread 
 At home. The family and those who know them tell that a part of theirs 
 Money went to Morocco to the same family members who still remained there.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  While I am 
 Romanians the 3 seriously injured workers who are still in the hospital and for 
 one of them has not yet been dissolved the prognosis while we 
 let's talk.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How much is the 
 life of these workers? How much the wealth produced by them is worth 
 their work? It is worth a lot for the master, large, medium -sized masters and 
 small, of the exploitation chain.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is true for us 
 Much more the life of these workers than all this system.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  AND 
 evident that there will be no justice for these dead workers 
 As with the many dead workers if we do not fight to abolish the 
 system that kills, the capitalist system, the system based on 
 profit. Because behind these deaths there is, at the end of everything, 
 exploitation and profit, i.e. the readings of the social system in 
 we live, that workers pay on jobs also with the 
 life.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But dying is alone 
 a part of the gigantic war that is conducted against i 
 workers, a war made of hundreds, thousands of accidents, of 
 occupational diseases, made by everything that is created in the 
 daily life by the workers, from their families.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The new code 
 of the contracts. Everyone today discover the new contract code, the "waterfall contracts". The last stage of the wild use of contracts 
 and subcontracting that is not certain of these days, nor certainly this 
 construction site began with this government. The governments that have it 
 preceded - both technical and center -left and on the long journey 
 backwards of the long Christian Democrat governments, etc., the whole cycle of 
 governments - If you look at governments in all these years, you can see that 
 they continually produced the same result: workers' massacres, 
 deaths at work, massacres of all kinds, railway, in cisterns, 
 In the plants for explosions and fires, a chain of massacres it has 
 Given to the usual litany. In this usual litany nothing is 
 really changed, indeed if it has changed it has changed for the worse.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These deaths are 
 fault of all governments and all this system, this must be said 
 clear. It is not the last government that killed them. Of course, the last 
 government has contributed significantly to their death, 
 to the execution of these workers, because an execution in this 
 War for profit is the one that took place in this construction site.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 the last step, first of all wanted by Salvini and supported - given the 
 same class matrix and the same conception - from Meloni and from 
 All the rulers and ministers of this government is valid for 
 All construction sites. Imagine what presents itself with the big ones 
 Works, from the bridge over the Strait of Messina to the works for the G7 of 
 Puglia, etc. etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this chain 
 Summer is the non -exceptional rule. In this chain death 
 It is announced, the end is known and therefore is any hypocritical 
 Sometimes denounces made by the newspapers and by everyone when it happens. AND 
 hypocritical, because everyone knows very well that this system must be defended 
 And kept alive because it is their system. And this system 
 It produces chain, "cascade", dead at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's clear that 
 This involves the maximum reduction, the competition of competition that leads to transforming the place of 
 I work in a tomb, in a cemetery.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this contract 
 The figures vary. There are 64 companies, some with contracts 
 fictitious. The 5 dead workers were over the third level of subcontracting. 
 To save on wages, the workers were not framed in 
 construction contract - not that the building contract has saved who knows who knows 
 which lives, it is clear, when the unions raise their voices: “Not 
 they were with the construction contract ", because, those who have the contract 
 Are Edile protected? They are not dead, they are not part of the audience of 
 dead at work? do not reach the first places among the dead on the 
 Work? - were paid as metalworkers, drivers, cranes and 
 etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No contract 
 It is really applied, but the contracts that have been signed are 
 all were contracts to lose, be clear. The chain of contracts 
 national in recent years has turned into a chain of 
 worsening precisely on work performance, security, for 
 do not talk about objectively reduced wages, because no 
 contract recovered neither inflation nor the cost of the increase 
 productivity and so on. Low wages, contracts 
 insufficient are for the whole working class. The inhalation is 
 A constant certainly facilitated by the subcontracting chain.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the chain of 
 subcontracting is not the exception, it is the logical consequence of the system 
 of the contracts, is the logical consequence of the contracts that do not 
 protect, it is the logical consequence of the general system that there 
 promotes.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Companies are 
 Like vampires, it never enough for him. And therefore the 
 their thirst for profits exacerbated by the competition, by the economic crisis 
 which feeds this competition, causes the obligations of 
 safety, workers' training fail.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the 
 training of workers, but what training if the conditions of 
 work are out of control in the sense that they do not protect and are not 
 based on the protection of the primacy of workers' life? But 
 Certainly also on this ground we have always gone worse. Not 
 Only the laws are insufficient, but the laws are largely 
 inapplicated and not from now, always and more and more, as you are that yes 
 The collective force of workers is weakened, the existence of a 
 union that would protect working conditions daily. 
 Without the union that protect the conditions of 
 work, without a rigid daily battle for the application 
 of the laws, it is clear that security is truly entrusted to the 
 luck the life of workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the life of 
 workers is - precisely for the very fact of being workers of 
 A capitalist system - it is bad luck, it is the tragedy of 
 tragedies of a system founded on man's exploitation 
 on man.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  How not to try 
 Indignation for the things that Minister Calderone says? a hateful 
 person, the head of labor consultants, the fox guard 
 of the chicken coop, whose sole purpose is clearly to encourage the classic 
 category of the servants of the master: the work consultants are used a 
 Erlude labor laws. Think about putting them to do the ministers who 
 What they will do if not to build a system based on the elimination of 
 laws at work, going against all those laces and laces that i 
 masters do not want for the free exploitation of the workforce that 
 produces the infernal chain that translates into the death of 
 workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The minister of 
 I went there and had the tough face to say that he has 
 increased work inspectors when everyone knows that 
 Labor inspectors in most realities have disappeared. 
 Their powers, however not extended, have been reduced. 
 The action of the notorious Minister Sacconi of the Berlusconi government is 
 was always to transform inspectors into consultants of 
 companies and goodwill, the good arrangement of many inspectors, certainly does not fulfill the work inspectorates that they have transformed 
 In all this, so much so that inspectors and inspectors of 
 work that have been in the past that have retired 
 they are remembered while currently who can remember the 
 Labor inspectors?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The fact 
 Today's newspaper holds that not 
 There had been no inspection for this huge construction site, that is 
 A huge construction site that is almost as much as a neighborhood, so much so 
 it is true that the collapse of this construction site has alarmed everyone 
 And he could cause death not only of those who worked but also of those who lived there, including children who went to school, etc. etc. Well, 
 how not to demand that where there are the large construction sites or in the 
 industrial areas, in the large industrial areas of contracts, does not 
 Is it a permanent station of the inspectors?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Not that these 
 stations can save who knows which lives, but they certainly have 
 a minimum of deterrence effect. Inspective stations on places must be provided 
 of work how the construction sites open, the large construction sites and yes 
 equip all the structures to hold the large construction sites, a permanent workstation of the work inspectors, 
 Clearly assisted by Ausl and everything you need. Why not 
 There is no relationship between large dimensions of construction sites, area 
 industrial, tide of contractors and the inspectorate of 
 work and the so -called control bodies.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So evident how ridiculous all the measures that are neither more nor less than 
 tax exemptions like the prizes to the masters if the worker does not die.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So we came to the point that not to make workers die 
 A prize, a tax exemption or bonus or other. Exactly the 
 Nelly, shouldn't the norm be? No, another amnesty, for di 
 more estimate, contributory discounts and penalties in exchange for the 
 promise to get in order.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Throughout 2023 
 1485 were the deaths at work. Only on February 16 15 
 workers died at work. Since the beginning of the year 194 died, 
 of which 148 materially in the workplace and 46 ongoing.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This chain now 
 It is practically legalized by this government. "Legalized": this 
 Which was sanctioned now is legalized, condoned. The great words 
 Here they should not serve, a body -to -hand battle is needed and one 
 organized structure on jobs. This structure today does not 
 there is, this structure is to be built, this structure deserves the 
 change of the trade union organization and the methods and forms of 
 struggle against the deaths at work itself.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now the mother of 
 All of all the laws is the residence permit for all 
 migrant workers because this makes it the most blackmail and 
 therefore more exposed to deaths at work. So it's not just 
 on the laws to contain the deaths at the work you can act, but 
 on all the laws that produce that condition: contracts to 
 maximum reduction, "cascade", the types of contacts there are, the 
 system of controls that is certainly seen by the masters as a 
 discomfort, something to avoid. How many tricks are when there are i 
 Check? Whoever has really made inspection activities know 
 Very well. How the inspector arrives the owners try to hide 
 Everything that can be sanctioned with sometimes almost tragicomic effects.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This government is 
 Responsible, the masters are responsible for these deaths. It is not 
 it is true that they are tragic fatality nor much less that they depend on 
 "Pilone not put well": it is clear that in a condition of 
 This genre any error, any non -conducted operation 
 Well, it can be translated into death, the massacre.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Put i 
 workers safe in the workplace means putting them to 
 Error test.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This kind of 
 war that the masters lead, the system, the governments, this 
 Government, requires an adequate response to the class war. War 
 class in work, class war on the territory, 
 General class war.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Finally, two 
 words. How much is the life of the workers worth? 2 hours of strikes!
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The 
 Landini's ridiculous trombonate and servility even in front of the 
 death of the proletarians, of the workers of Luigi Sbarra, the secretary 
 of the CISL now secretary of the government, who did not want to do 
 Not even the 2 hours of strike, if the large trade union organizations 
 they consider this the cost, of what can be done in the face of 
 dead, massacres, obviously this is the ring on which it will need to 
 intervene.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, you have to 
 intervene. Through the alternative trade union organizations, 
 certainly better than the official ones, but certainly with the 
 construction of a daily and prolonged conflict, part of the 
 General conflict.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Needless to say 
 What happens in the matter of the after-bridge: the processes, the 
 Investigations, acquittals, ridiculous penalties. About penalties 
 ridiculous, of course we have always been for the increase in penalties, in 
 This sense the request for introduction of a new crime should 
 find us agree, but we all know that everyone's experience 
 these years shows that it is not the increase in crimes that produces one 
 better security because everything is entrusted to governments, to 
 State, to the system that applies them and this system is the system of 
 Execution denied not the system of justice that does justice to the deaths at work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Certainly the 
 only positive results in these events were held not only 
 When family members, the work companions were on the piece, have 
 participated with human solidarity and support giving continuity 
 to the fight, to the war in the workplace to remove the causes that 
 They had produced death, with participation in the processes. These are 
 certainly not the "solution" but forms of struggle necessary for 
 Building the material strength that can lead to a solution.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is clear that 
 From all our speech it descends inevitable that the only one 
 Solution is the revolution.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And, please, you don't tell us that they are 
 words, don't tell us "Yes, but who does it?" and so on. This type 
 of speech established as a commonplace, common sense, in the files 
 of workers and popular masses, contributed to the death of 
 These workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This yes, yes 
 can say loudly: even if you all consider yourself acquitted, you are 
 all involved. Because the revolution is the only solution.
