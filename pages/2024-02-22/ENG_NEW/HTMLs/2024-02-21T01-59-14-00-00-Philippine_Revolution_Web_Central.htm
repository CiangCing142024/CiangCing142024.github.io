  The danger of landslides on February 6th in Maco, Davao de Oro (former Compostela Valley) is the worst of many tragedies in Mindanao, and the Davao de Oro one of the Philippine mine, and not first at the center of the Philippines Apex Mining Corporation. The people have been around the whole region of Davao, and the natives of Mindanao against the massive and vulnerable mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the face of its tragedy, and contrary to fake discouragement and provoking good, neither did apex stop its operations and continue to occupy the remaining workers of mine.
 </p>
 <h3>
  History of Understanding and Spanish
 </h3>
 <p>
  Apex mining began in the legacy of the Mansaka tribe in 1976. Like elsewhere, it was not only destroyed the ecology of the forests and lands, also destroyed the traditional livelihoods and culture of the Mansaka. In the following years, the mansakers were slowly evicted to their communities, and they were enslaved as workers in its mines or support systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even before, it is notorious to the low-shaped and unsafe labor conditions. Its operation was suspended in 2000 after the workers were charged. It returns to the dynamic mining under the management of foreign Goldridge Mining Corporation companies (US US), Viclode Mining Corporation, and Mintricor Inc. In 2003. The Mine Gold was purchased (which was formerly in the Canadian company) in 2009, also selling Asvi (Malaysia) in 2009. In 2013, it was purchased at the Monte Razon Jr and his compradors.
 </p>
 <p>
  APEX's current minimal minimum of MPSA-MPSA-225-2005-XI to cover 679.02 hectares in the aggregate villages of Masara and Teresa, and MPSA-234-2007-XIs of 1,558.53 hectares Barangay in Masara, hot, Tagbaros, New Leyte, Elizalde and New Barili in Maco and some parts of the adjacent town of Mabini. In 2023, the company further expanded operations when it purchased the Asia Alliance Mining Resources Corp. with a permit to minimize 20,000 hectares of Maco, Mabini and Marvel, all in Davao de Oro.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are 25 years, which can also be ploted 25 years, two MPSA or 2030 and 2032. In the same two MPSAs, it is estimated to obtain 1,250,000 eleven gold. In 2022, the company spent ₱ 3.339 billion net income, which was largely 316.1% compared to 2021. In 2023, it recorded ₱ 2.3 billion net we were in the first nine months.
 </p>
 <p>
  Bugs in the native treasure, the reactionary state only paid for 4% excise tax. The company has always been delayed to provide crumbs of 1% obligation to its local government and tribe. After almost four decades, the only joke of the apex contribution to the community is a school and a health center. Its housing for its own worker is still built with a non-governmental organization. Tribunal and slaves and slaves remain one of the most degradation of the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  The company has made it right in the company, the ery it comes to mine is always raised, worst in the middle of November and February. The soil is so soft and vulnerable to the hoarse of the shop. It is also located in a Fault Line (Breakfast), and vulnerable to earthquake. In another state study, 80% of Davao de Oro is declared "Geohazard". Between this, not only maintained, Hindunua, the Apex is still condemning its operations in the prubinth.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the estimation of the attitudes, many incidents of land for land are not reported. In addition to the open-pit mining of Apex, the company produces tunnels under the earth. It encourages the soil and stones under, who increases the possibility of the shop of the great chunk.
 </p>
 <h3>
  History of violence
 </h3>
 <p>
  Like elsewhere, Davao de Oro's violence is mining. The next reactionary regime has launched the brutal repression and militarization throughout the Mansaka community. In 2017, less than three bunches of AFP have been reduced from the AFP from the ere, political civilians to "surrender," killing mass and ordinary civilians, and other detention, and other abbreviation and emptying.
 </p>
 <p>
  Torridge the province of CAFGU detachments and military camps serving as guards and protectors in mine operations. The 66th IB contributes to the 10th ID command. The list of war crimes and violations of the human rights of the division is not only in the Davao region but even in Bukidnon, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur.
 </p>
 <p>
  The victims of the 66th IB include Marcelo Monterona, killed by soldiers in January 2014 in front of his store. Monterona is at the Council of Indug People, the organization that leads the apex mining to the injury to the farmers and native communities. In 2013, the Apex was moved by the organization to pay ₱ 3.6 million and arrange the corrupt infrastructure after their hurricane paul community hit.
 </p>
 <p>
  On April 10, 2014, Red fighters under the New People's Army - Southern Mindanao Region's mine in Apex as a punishment for continuing to expand its undergrounds and open-pit mining. This is between the repeated warning of the revolutionary movement of the warm injury to the expansion of the Mine of Indigenous and Nature's communities.
 </p>
 <p>
  During this time, the company extends the company of the remaining foresee of Maco, which was declared protected by the revolutionary people in the area. Among other seashells in Apex; 1) Do not pay damages to the victims in the two landslides in 2007 and 2008, 2) under its workforce, 3) failed rehabilitation of the rivers and bridges it promised Residents, and 4) Active funding combat operations in the 9th IB have been able to form a former Province.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Military was declared in the 2022 "insurgency-free" the Davao de Oro and celebrated it with large mines. In spite of this, some AFP battalions remained at the native and workers' communities to suppress the unanimous resistance to the people. In the face of continuing to rotate and tread the right and especially before the blasphemy, the people's heart continues to burn and resist.
