  Farmers and women's groups in Mendiola protested on February 14 to call for the dismissal of the Rice Liberalization Law (RLL), which was enacted that same day in 2018. They criticized the liberalization of rice imports that resulted in the increase Especially in rice prices, in contrast to its promise to lower the price. By the end of 2023, the highest “rice inflation” was recorded at 19.6%, fastest in the last 14 years. Compared to 2022, rice rose by about ₱ 10 per kilogram last year. By 2024, the rice increased by ₱ 1- ₱ 2 per kilogram. The price of rice markets in the country has dropped further.
