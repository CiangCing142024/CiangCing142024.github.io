  The high commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights has published a press release in which yes
  <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/02/israelopt-un-experts-appalled-reported-human-rights-violations-against">
   report
  </a>
  the 
  serious concerns of the United Nations experts regarding 
 alarming reports and complaints of serious violations of human rights 
 towards Palestinian women and girls in the Gaza Strip and in 
  The West Bank, including sexual violence and rape.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to information received by experts, women and girls 
 Palestinians would have been subjected to rapes, sexual violence, and 
 arbitrary executions, often together with their family members, including the 
 children, inside the Gaza Strip. Experts expressed 
 Shock for the relationships that indicate deliberate attacks and killings 
 extrajudicial to Palestinian women and children, some of whom, 
 According to reports, they held pieces of white fabric in hand while 
 They were killed by the Israeli army or by the affiliated forces.
 </p>
 <p>
  United Nations experts highlighted detention 
 arbitrary of hundreds of Palestinian women and girls from 7 October, 
 including defenders of human rights, journalists and humanitarian operators. 
 According to reports, many prisoners have undergone inhuman treatments 
  and degrading, including the refusal of basic necessities (such as 
 Absorbents, food and medicines) as well as serious beatings. Have been reported 
  cases of sexual violence, including cases of rape, with prisoners 
 presumably subjected to searches by male officers 
 of the Israeli army and threatened with further sexual violence.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, there is disturbing news of Palestinian women and children, 
 including babies, who disappeared after contact with the Israeli army, 
 Some of which are transferred by force to Israel. Experts have 
 requested an in -depth and impartial investigation by underlining that these 
 acts would constitute serious violations of international human rights e 
  of humanitarian law, potentially equivalent to crimes 
 persecutable in accordance with international criminal law.
 </p>
 <p>
  "The managers must be held responsible", have 
 The experts underlined, â€œand the victims and their families deserve 
 full repair and justice ". United Nations experts have 
 also urged an immediate action to face these atrocities e 
  guarantee the protection of Palestinian women and girls in the 
 Strip of Gaza and in West Bank.
