   From the class and combative current we express our deep concern for the lack of agreement for the increase in the minimum, vital and mobile salary. In a context marked by the adjustment policies promoted by the government of Javier Milei, which triggered inflation through the clouds and hits the purchasing power of the whole of the workers, and especially in those with precarious works and in our retirees .
  </p>
  <p class="normal">
   From the CCC we firmly support the proposal of the CGT, in agreement with all the centrals, which request an increase of 85%, a measure that contributes to alleviating, although partially, the damage inflicted on the salaries of the workers by the adjustment policies inflationary of the national government.
  </p>
  <p class="normal">
   We understand that the absence of government proposal, in tune with the business sectors, is a maneuver to make the meeting fail and be able to close it by decree. Thus, in fact, we are the only workers to pay the adjustment.
  </p>
  <p class="normal">
   It is clear that the adjustment on "the caste" was a campaign slogan, the reality is that the adjustment is about the Argentine people, especially the precarious workers, the retirees, and all those who live from the informal economy.
  </p>
  <p class="normal">
   For a minimum, vital and mobile salary that guarantees a decent life for all workers in Argentina!
