  Is Eni stealing Palestinian gas in collusion with Israel?. The Italian 
government is the largest shareholder in the energy giant Eni, with a 
stake of 32% (social networking sites) The Palestinian Gaza Marine field
 is one of the oldest gas fields discovered in the eastern Mediterranean
 region. Despite the discovery of the Gaza offshore field since 2000, 
its resources, which are estimated at more than one trillion cubic feet 
of natural gas, are still locked in the ground. Eni confirmed that "no 
agreement in particular has yet to be signed, and that it currently has 
no activity in the region"

  The Palestinian Gaza Marine field is one of the oldest gas fields 
discovered in the eastern Mediterranean region, and it is seen as a 
promising opportunity for the Palestinians who suffer from a scarcity of
 energy resources, amid their suffering from the Israeli occupation.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite the discovery of the Gaza offshore field 
since 2000, its resources, which are estimated at more than one trillion
 cubic feet of natural gas - which far exceeds the needs of the 
Palestinian people - are still locked in the ground and have not been 
exploited commercially until now due to Israel’s obstruction of all 
efforts aimed at establishing an independent energy infrastructure. For 
the Palestinians, it is also trying to seize these resources to export 
them through deals with neighboring countries with the participation of 
European Union member states.

  </p>
 </h2>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the beginning of this month, the issue of the 
Gaza gas field returned to the spotlight following the legal notice sent
 by the American law firm Foley Hoag - on behalf of Palestinian human 
rights organizations - to the Italian energy giant Eni and other 
international and Israeli energy companies.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The office warned it not to proceed with exploration
 activities in the Gaza offshore well, which is owned by the Palestinian
 people, in accordance with the provisions of the 1982 United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which the State of Palestine signed in
 2019.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  This warning comes after Israel announced last 
October 29 that it had granted a license to the Italian energy company 
to operate in the Gaza field, which Palestinian human rights 
organizations considered a violation of international law.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Director of the Center for International Legal 
Studies, Fabio Marcelli, said in an interview with Al Jazeera Net that 
Eni's contract with Israel constitutes a violation of international law,
 which prohibits the occupying authority from disposing of the natural 
resources found in the lands it occupies, including the adjacent marine 
areas.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Marcelli warned that the company's mere initiation 
of exploration activities to exploit resources belonging to the 
Palestinians would make it a partner of the State of Israel, which is 
now burdened with accurate and documented accusations of committing 
genocide before the International Court of Justice.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The same spokesman pointed out that "Eni's 
complicity" - which is considered a public company - in such crimes will
 extend to the government of Georgia Meloni, which is working to supply 
Israel with part of the weapons it uses to carry out genocide in the 
Gaza Strip.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  For its part, Eni explained - in an exclusive 
statement to Al Jazeera Net - that it "obtained - along with other 
companies - exploration licenses based on an international tender, and 
that licenses related to the exploration activities expected in October 
2023 were granted."
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The company confirmed that "no agreement in 
particular has yet to be signed, and that it currently has no activity 
in the region, and that wherever it operates, it is keen to ensure that 
its activities are consistent with international law and best safety 
practices."

 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  With the continuation of the Israeli aggression on 
Gaza, the matter has become embarrassing, not only for Eni, but also for
 the Italian government itself, which is the largest shareholder in the 
company by 32%.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  This was evident in the responses of Italian Foreign
 Minister Antonio Tayani - last Wednesday - during the parliamentary 
questioning when he tried to evade the government's responsibility in 
this case, stressing that the company located in the entire 
Mediterranean region is listed on the stock exchange and operates 
according to market rules.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Tayani tried to downplay the importance of the 
agreement, referring to Eni’s confirmation that the contract is still 
under preparation, and that there are no ongoing exploration operations 
yet in the area in question.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He also tried to reduce the pressure exerted on the 
Italian company, pointing out the importance of reconciling economic 
interests with the legitimate aspirations of peoples, and stressing the 
necessity of defining borders and maritime areas in accordance with 
rules dictated by international law.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The government official added, "We are facing an 
issue of conflict of interest, and the best solution is the path of 
mediation, dialogue, and finding solutions through negotiation, similar 
to the agreement reached by Lebanon and Israel in October 2022 regarding
 the demarcation of their maritime borders."
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera Net, 
Angelo Bonelli, the official spokesman for Green Europe and 
representative of the Green and Left Alliance, denounced Tayani's 
statements, describing them as unacceptable.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Bonelli - who interrogated the Foreign Minister in 
Parliament regarding the issue - confirmed that Israel - in accordance 
with Article 55 of the Hague Treaty - does not have the right to use 
Palestinian natural resources to achieve its own economic gains.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He said, "We know very well that the energy issue is
 very important to our country, but there are also lofty morals and 
values ​​that lead us to say that at a time when more than 30,000 
Palestinian civilians are being killed today, there are those who are 
trying to steal their resources to achieve their own profits."
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to Al Jazeera Net's question about what 
initiatives he intends to take during the coming period, the Italian MP 
revealed his party's intention to plead before the European Court of 
Justice against the company "Eni" in an international case.
 </p>

 </h2>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  For his part, journalist Alberto Negri - in an 
interview with Al Jazeera Net - described Tayani's statements as 
"ridiculous", and that they were "a desperate attempt to climb onto a 
sheet of glass."
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He said that the minister's talk about the absence 
of any activities yet to exploit Palestinian natural resources is due to
 the fact that the exploration phase has not begun and must be 
completed.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Negri explained to Al Jazeera Net, "Eni has 
certainly not spoken in the past, nor even the Italian government, about
 concluding an agreement with Israel to exploit the Gaza gas field. Had 
it not been for the warning that reached the company in the past few 
days, this incident would have remained hidden from Italian public 
opinion."
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  He explained the attempt by Eni and the Italian 
government to conceal the agreement by saying that the war and the 
Israeli massacres against the Palestinians had already begun, and 
therefore they had to announce their suspension as a minimum.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Negri added, "Our Foreign Minister's talk about 
conflicts of interest and preferring the path of mediation and dialogue 
in such cases is nothing but a speck of dust in the eyes, because Eni 
did not negotiate with the Palestinians, but only with the Israeli 
government, even though the Gaza Marine field was discovered a year 
ago." 2000, and the Palestinians have not been able to extract gas from 
it until now due to the severe blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza 
Strip since 2007.”
