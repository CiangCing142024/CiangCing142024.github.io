    GENEVA
 (19 February 2024) – UN experts* today expressed alarm over credible 
allegations of egregious human rights violations to which Palestinian 
women and girls continue to be subjected in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank.
   </p>
   <p>
    Palestinian women and girls have reportedly been arbitrarily
 executed in Gaza, often together with family members, including their 
children, according to information received. “We are shocked by reports 
of the deliberate targeting and extrajudicial killing of Palestinian 
women and children in places where they sought refuge, or while fleeing.
 Some of them were reportedly holding white pieces of cloth when they 
were killed by the Israeli army or affiliated forces,” the experts said.
   </p>
   <p>
    The
 experts expressed serious concern about the arbitrary detention of 
hundreds of Palestinian women and girls, including human rights 
defenders, journalists and humanitarian workers, in Gaza and the West 
Bank since 7 October. Many have reportedly been subjected to inhuman and
 degrading treatment, denied menstruation pads, food and medicine, and 
severely beaten. On at least one occasion, Palestinian women detained in
 Gaza were allegedly kept in a cage in the rain and cold, without food.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We
 are particularly distressed by reports that Palestinian women and girls
 in detention have also been subjected to multiple forms of sexual 
assault, such as being stripped naked and searched by male Israeli army 
officers. At least two female Palestinian detainees were reportedly 
raped while others were reportedly threatened with rape and sexual 
violence,” the experts said. They also noted that photos of female 
detainees in degrading circumstances were also reportedly taken by the 
Israeli army and uploaded online.
   </p>
   <p>
    The experts expressed concern 
that an unknown number of Palestinian women and children, including 
girls, have reportedly gone missing after contact with the Israeli army 
in Gaza. “There are disturbing reports of at least one female infant 
forcibly transferred by the Israeli army into Israel, and of children 
being separated from their parents, whose whereabouts remain unknown,” 
they said.
   </p>
   <p>
    “We remind the Government of Israel of its obligation 
to uphold the right to life, safety, health, and dignity of Palestinian 
women and girls and to ensure that no one is subjected to violence, 
torture, ill-treatment or degrading treatment, including sexual 
violence,” the experts said.
   </p>
   <p>
    They called for an independent, 
impartial, prompt, thorough and effective investigation into the 
allegations and for Israel to cooperate with such investigations.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Taken
 together, these alleged acts may constitute grave violations of 
international human rights and humanitarian law, and amount to serious 
crimes under international criminal law that could be prosecuted under 
the Rome Statute,” the experts said. “Those responsible for these 
apparent crimes must be held accountable and victims and their families 
are entitled to full redress and justice,” they added.
