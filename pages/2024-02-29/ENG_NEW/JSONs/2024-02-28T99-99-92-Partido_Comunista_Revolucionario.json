On that path, paranate and disregard education by stating that \u2018schools are from the provinces\u2019. This is at least to deny our National Constitution, which in its articles 14 and 14 bis speak of the indeligible responsibility of the national State, regarding the right to education. They have definanced part of our salary, such as the plus that give us connectivity, cutting the Fonid, teaching incentive and what is even more serious, the money of the dining rooms, of connecting equality, of the improvement plan, corresponding to the technical schools and infrastructure\".\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And Marinozzi added: \u201cGiven the severity of the situation, companions and colleagues, we have summoned ourselves from much of the schools, of all the branches, regardless of the groups, because this has to find us together, and especially very close with community. We have come dozens of partners by train, in subway and walking, very happy to meet in unity to face this hunger and delivery policy. \u201d\n  </p>\n  <h5>\n  </h5>\n  <h5>\n   In La Pampa\n  </h5>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-68249\" height=\"231\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" src=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/marcha-docente-La-Pampa-300x169.jpg\" srcset=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/marcha-docente-La-Pampa-300x169.jpg\" width=\"410\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <h5>\n   In Neuqu\u00e9n\n  </h5>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-68250\" height=\"223\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" src=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Marcha-docente-Neuquen-300x165.jpg\" srcset=\"http://pcr.org.ar/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Marcha-docente-Neuquen-300x165.jpg\" width=\"405\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Today N \u00b0 2000 02/28/2024\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n </div>\n <!-- .entry-content -->\n</div>\n", "source": "https://pcr.org.ar/nota/paro-nacional-docente-3/", "type": "article", "title": "National Teaching Unemployment", "description": "There were acts and marches in several provinces, coinciding with the beginning of the classes, in which ATE workers converged, also in the day of struggle, and the historical CONADU (university teachers), which also called unemployment.
