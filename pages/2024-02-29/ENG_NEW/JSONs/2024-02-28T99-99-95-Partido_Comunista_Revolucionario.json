This government froze the university budget, and through the DNU 70, with the repeal of the rental law, it has made many thousands cannot renew the rent. If we add the terrible price increases, and remove it from transportation subsidy with the increase in the ticket, thousands of university students will not be able to continue their studies. This budget shrink is already doing, in some universities, that they cut the possibility of scoring subjects, or that begin to collect a \u201csolidarity bonus\u201d, as in Chivilcoy and Tucum\u00e1n, to be able to study.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"normal\">\n   That is why we are here and we will boost the unity to fight at the university that the government sends the budget items because the university's functioning is at risk.
