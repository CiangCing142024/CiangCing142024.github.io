   Some comrades recently were linked to the Communist Workers Union (MLM) to contribute their forces and capabilities to the construction of the working class party in Colombia from the militancy. In their entry application letters some of the reasons that motivated them, for example:
   <em>
    Scientifically adopt to Marxism Leninismo Maoism as the guide for the action of the working class in Colombia through the Vanguardian leader party, the desire to contribute good ideas to the social group that is the working class and to be illuminated by the science of the MLM.
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   Comrades are part of a dozen proletarians who in recent months have requested to link the organization. Some are already sacrificing part of the free time left by the long working days or academic to bring the burial of the capitalist system.
  </p>
<p>
   The new militants vigorize the political capacity of the agencies, all exceeded the stage of rigorous selection of affiliates in the circles of study and revolutionary work and demonstrated the understanding of the program for the revolution in Colombia and the need for their revolutionary application. This was a joint work of organisms and is an incentive to insist on preparing and carrying out the “Jaime Rangel” organization campaign.
  </p>
<p>
   The process of building the party progresses, the objective and subjective conditions are generating imperceptible quantitative changes that are transformed into qualitative changes by increasing the political capacity of the organization and creating the conditions to specify the central task of the tactic together with other communist nuclei: the Congress of Restoration of the Party in Colombia as part of the new communist international, whose mission is to bring socialist consciousness to the labor movement, organize its class struggle and direct it towards its world goal and final objective: socialism and communism.

<p>
   Next, we reproduce sections of some of the entrance letters that have sent us on recent premilitative days that decided to take the step and organize in the UOC (MLM). We call the best sons and daughters of the proletariat to join this propartido organization in Colombia.
  </p>
<p>
   Greetings, comrades:
  </p>
<p>
   I am a young communist and I write the following letter to request my formal income from the Communist Workers Union (MLM).
  </p>
<p>
   I discovered the portal during the outbreak of 2021, at that time I identified me as an anarchist, since the self -denominated organizations that I observed only generated in my contempt due to their constant call to conciliation.
  </p>
<p>
   Upon hearing the comrades talk about the path we had to follow the great masses that we had risen, my spirits changed. Things with the union were different, they were saying and doing, but not in an extreme leftist sense, but in a coherent and revolutionary sense: with the creation of the immediate program, the calls to the creation of a truly revolutionary communist party and with different Propaganda actions.
  </p>
<p>
   Regarding my expectations as a member of the Union, they are set to support and advance the construction of the revolutionary party in Colombia, a true communist party in which youth plays a decisive role, since no revolution has been made leaving youth On the side and, as Mao says, the world is mostly our.
  </p>
<p>
   To. D.
  </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-black-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-black-background-color has-background"/>
<p>
   Best regard.
  </p>
<p>
   When I entered the University, I had a taste towards the Colombian guerrillas and therefore I wanted to belong to any of them. Thus, my first step was to look for a university organization and in this way I entered a cameilist organization. Of course he wanted to be a good camilista, so despite being atheist he tried to assume the theology of liberation. This organization was far from participating in a trip, which from my romanticism of that time wanted, and therefore I decided to retire to enter another camilist organization with "clandestine" work. After a while, for various reasons, this organization dissolved ...
  </p>
<p>
   After a while I started talking to a Maoist Leninist Marxist friend of whom I listened to logical reasoning about issues such as the State taking, that is, imposing the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this way I approached these theories ...
  </p>
<p>
   Today I feel committed to: constantly studying revolutionary scientific theory, the context of national and world reality; be willing to be a mass leader and give up interests of another class other than those of the proletariat.
  </p>
<p>
   I greatly appreciate your reception.
   <br>
   Carefully,
   <br>
   PP
  </br></br></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-black-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-black-background-color has-background"/>
<p>
   My social and economic origin corresponds to the working class, despite this my family had certain privileges ... however, there was a fact that marked my experience at the political level, namely, I realize in school that many of my classmates They did not have for rest, sometimes we were going to do work to the house of a partner and the living conditions were difficult, the places were dense, the atmosphere was hard, there I understood that many things did not march well in society.
  </p>
<p>
   Subsequently, when I entered the public university those questions continued to question me, I saw the commitment necessary ... I met a group of colleagues who belonged to the anti -imperialist brigades ... They started several controversies with the direction, because there was little space for questioning, all self -criticism It was taken in a bad way, after several discussions the contradictions were exacerbated and several militants removed us to the point that we were practically expelled. ... Personally I was always a little reluctant to the ideological line of the organization, because there was a cult of personality to Bob Avakian, to the point that only that author was read and did not allow reading historical materialism (Marx, Engels , Lenin, Gramsci, Rosa Luxembourg, Mao, etc.) but I never managed to identify that new that used in the Avakian writings, because everything he said was basically a replica and summary to what was said by the classics of Marxism, and his Once, there was a copy of copying and hitting the orientations of the United States Revolutionary Communist Party by the brigades, where the country's concrete material conditions were not evaluated, but it was a totally antidiallectic look.
  </p>
<p>
   After a while I was reading, doing work, speaking with colleagues and I have decided to take the step of the Communist Workers Union (MLM), because I find in the organization a serious program, an internationalist look, a communist revolutionary line.

    ORGANIZATION AND AGAINS FOR A SYSTEM

     On the way of the race
     <br/>

<br/>
  Folk rage is inflating against anti -populist government policy. People, youth and workers see, full of indignation, their lives downgrade, their rights to shrink, their income to be cut. At the same time that a money laundering flows to imperialist funds for beastly military equipment. At the same time as the local big -bodied class, which gives all kinds of freedom to profitable at the expense of the broad popular masses and in more and more fields, such as education and care.
  <br/>
<br/>
  The indignation overflows a year after the state crime in Tempi, with 57 dead and dozens of injuries. A crime that proved the frosty indifference of this system for human life and has led to magnificent mobilizations across the country. A crime that the government and state mechanisms want to hide. A crime that will not be forgotten!
  <br/>
<br/>
  Samples of this rage are the great struggles of students and farmers. Games that have nothing to do with some "minorities" are not caprices or obsessions, as the media are presented by them. They are struggles for the right to life!
  <br/>
<br/>
  Such examples are the workers' struggles that sprout from "nowhere", breaking the apparent immobility, which many want to present as a struggle. The race of Tunisian workers in the workshop of Teleperformance is a recent example where employees are looking for their racing pace, in the same way that e-food and artists' mobilizations broke out or the magnificent long-term struggle in Malamatina.
  <br/>
<br/>
  These struggles express the moods of the great popular majority that narrows under barbaric anti -populist politics. Moods that do not fit into the various electoral plans that are re -eating shortly before the European elections. Moods that are not redeemed in the polls. Moods that need to highlight the direction of mass struggle, the front of resistance and claim, which is the only one who can shake bourgeoisie, to win, to overthrow the barbaric policy.
  <br/>
<br/>
  • These are the moods that intensify the concern of the system centers. Because they show the real situation, beyond all kinds of custom statistics. This concern of the system is also shown through the rabies with which it attacks any popular and labor reaction. Repression and persecutions are on the agenda. Against students and occupations, against farmers and blocks, against students and any suspicion of their mobilization, against teachers, against strikes, against unions. The Law of Hatzidakis, the laws on demonstrations, and the new amendment of the Criminal Code are moving in exactly that direction: terrorism and criminal extermination of those who are fighting and claiming.
  <br/>
<br/>
  So let this strike be another reason for concern for its capital and system! Let it be an opportunity to en masse labor, the resistance to anti -labor policy and the claim of work and life with rights.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Against the forces of consensus and subordination they made it to "get out of the obligation" and declare the end of the games.
  <br/>
<br/>
  Let it be a step towards the further establishment of the People's and Labor Movement, a step towards the people and workers.

  On February 26, that is, a couple of days after deserting 
 In fact, the Kiev meeting, Macron resumes the scene and throws a lot of petrol 
 On the fire of the enlargement of the war scenario saying that it is necessary

 "Emmanuel Macron insists on the possible sending of soldiers to Ukraine".

 "Slaving verbal escalation" says today's manifesto: inviting everyone 
 first "to" get a move "to increase the handings of armaments", then a

   "The

 definitely "against" and says that we need "a perspective 
 diplomatics ", while it is" surprising to bring out a topic that does not do 
 consent and creates a debate we don't need "
  </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   All these who for now, therefore, at least in words, have 
 Taken the distances, they were criticized by the Macron warflower imperialist: 
 "Many people who today say 'never, never' were the same as two years ago 
 They said "never tanks, never planes, never missiles long -haul" ".
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   But in fact no one denies weapons. Among the decisions 
 He took on Monday: Cyber-Difesa against Russian attacks on the allies; 
 co-production of weapons and ammunition; commitment to defend the threatened countries, such as 
 La Moldova; ability to support Ukraine at the border with Belarusia 
 with non -military forces; Smoking operations.

<p class="MsoNormal">
   And, moreover, “a new coalition for the 
 Delivery of medium and long range missiles (more than 70 km, such as the boots, 
 while Germany still holds back on the Taurus), and 15 countries support the initiative 
 Czech to recover ammunition between those who own them. " while “Parliament 
 European yesterday approved long -term support for Ukraine. "
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   The immediate position was not lacking 
 Russian imperialism: “The conflict between Russia and NATO will be 
 "Inevitable" if the West sends troops to Ukraine ".
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   Macron with this dangerous Boutade Warfundia has 
 However, put the "total war option" on the carpet!
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   This "discussion" on the possibility-necessity for the 
 capitalism-imperialism of the "total war" as you know will have another moment 
 Important to the next G7 to be held in Puglia in June.
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   On this we must repeat what we said in the 
 Yesterday's counter -information: “As it was in other G7, just remember the G7 of 
 Genoa - their base of unit to build war plans even more, i 
 plans of the oppression of peoples, the plans for the immediation of peoples, the plans 
 For the use of artificial intelligence for war purposes, the plans for 
 transform all climatic, environmental events, all the crises of 
 crisis, immigration, in a strenuous defense of a putrid and dying system e 
 oppose it with the violence of the armies, bombs, the army of the proletarians 
 and of the oppressed peoples that in all forms, in large and small forms, yes 
 opposes all this.
   <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   All at the G7 in Puglia to make evident that the world is 
 divided into two hills: the hill of imperialism, the hill of the proletarians, 
 of the peoples and all those who do not accept the world that are there 
 building and preparing, the horrible future, and the will to put an end to 
 This horror.

 In Europe, the German companies in the sector also pushes in the stock exchange ”such as the Rheinmetall 
 which closes in progress of 2.33%, while Renk (+6.73%) and Hersoldt bounce 
 (+7.67%) In addition to the French Thales who “ends the rising courses 
 2.58% in Paris "and the English" Bae Systems by 1.25% in London ".

 to draw up a report on EU competitiveness (see https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/02/pc-26- February-darghi-voce.html), 
 to ECOFIN last Saturday. Among the many other things on that occasion Draghi 
 He said "courageous actions if we want to finance costs are needed 
 of the double transition of the defense and maintain our social models and the 
 social cohesion ».

<p>
   Appeal in the international actions for the release of Georges Abdallah! (from March 6 to April 6, 2024)
  </p>
<p>
   Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! How many times have we chanted this slogan for so many years? How many times have we proclaimed it in the mass demonstrations of recent weeks and last months? There is no doubt that none could be held without being launched or taken over this historic watchword of clear and clear support for historic Palestine. Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Against all odds !
  </p>
<p>
   Palestine lives, it will live and it will defeat by this national liberation struggle which it leads, not since 1948 but since the presence of the first settlers on its land in the 1880s. It lives by its tireless fight, since the first day and by all possible forms of struggle (revolts, general strikes, actions of sabotage and military, guerrilla war) against the ardent of Zionist colonialism which aims not only to occupy its land but also to hunt its people, or even exterminate. She lives and reminds us that the Palestinians are not victims but fighters engaged against oppression, engaged in the only possible path for their salvation: that of resistance, the law of their existence. She lives against and against
  </p>
<p>
   While relentlessly facing the imperialists in the region, whose Zionist colonialism is only the bridgehead and the organic arm for economic, geostrategic and military control of the wealth of the Arab world. She lives against and against everything despite the repeated attempts to fragment the Palestinian identity, between the Palestinians of 1948, Gaza, West Bank ... Palestine lives, despite the betrayals of the Arab reactionary states which, normalization after normalization, tried in vain By their collaboration with the Zionist enemy of legitimizing the occupier and emptying the Palestinian liberation struggle of its panarabist and internationalist dimension. Palestine lives, will live and defeat despite the plans of standardization and sharing brandished each time that the resistance intensifies, despite all the attempts to liquidate its revolution and its land in the form of so-called "peace Just and durable ", from a solution to two states or" a state of all its citizens ", plans that the Palestinian resistance has known and will always thwart.
  </p>
<p>
   Until the very ranks of solidarity movements in Palestine, we hear: "Palestine lives, but at what price!" This price is the one that peoples have always paid to free themselves from colonialism and oppression; It is the one that the Palestinian people have paid and still pay today to overcome in their national liberation struggle. Indescriptible sufferings and endured sacrifices, thousands of martyrs in recent months but also in all of Palestinian national history are all evidence of the criminal nature of Zionism and imperialism. Faced with this barbarism, our task is not to propagate the illusion of a way out
  </p>
<p>
   Negotiated -a "just and lasting peace" which would perpetuate colonial domination -it is not to appeal to the "international community" or to institutions controlled by imperialism. In Palestine, takes place not a "conflict" from which it would be possible to come out by a fantasized outcome, but a colonial war which aims to eliminate a movement of resistance. Peace can never happen between the colonizer and the colonized. Human rights speeches, calls for negotiations, collaboration, even truces are only lures if we forget that only the defeat of the Zionist project will end the oppression. Any other way-and this is perhaps the main issue-helps to legitimize, consciously or not, the criminalization of the armed resistance and those who support it, presented as entrying this pacifist path of capitulation which does not not said his name.
  </p>
<p>
   The future of the Palestinians does not reside in a simple defeat of the Zionist extreme right by the establishment of an "democratic Israeli and law" which would be rid of the Apartheid policy; In reality and all the history of occupied Palestine demonstrates it: whether on the left or right, no Zionist group in power has denied its colonial settlement nature, none can be qualified as fascist that the group today at the head of the entity. Zionism is not reformable and even less amendable and any solidarity naively or intentionally calling for its democratization is in reality another side used to whiten it. The release of all Palestine, from the sea to the Jordan, and the return of all refugees will go through the only possible way in an anti -colonial war: that of the armed struggle.
  </p>
<p>
   So, while the Palestinian National Liberation Movement has been entering a new historical stage of its struggle in recent months, we must clearly express our support: unconditional support, without detours, alongside the Resistance, all resistance and its military actions for the destruction of the Zionist entity and its colonial project, the establishment of the national liberation project throughout historical Palestine and for the defense of the right to return of all refugees. In these times of chaos and in France of fierce repression, intimidation and threats of dissolution, infiltration and deviations of all kinds, we reaffirm the conscious commitments which are ours recalled in this text and by our Palestine compass that 'is Georges Abdallah's fight.
  </p>
<p>
   Because if there is a historical and unwavering support for the heroic resistance and army of the Palestinian people, it is the one that fighter Georges Abdallah has always shown by his actions and expressed in his statements. This commitment-since his first actions as an activist when he opposed arms in hand to the interests of the imperialists in the Middle East and the attacks of their "operational base" that is the Zionist entity until today Hui - has never deviated, not even facked! True to the watchword of the FPLP of the 1970s "to strike the enemy wherever he is" is for armed actions accomplished in France by his organization, the Farl, that justice condemned him in 1987 to Life prison. The remarks he then made during the his lawsuit transformed into a revolutionary gallery today resonate in particular with regard notably to the genocide in Gaza and what Western imperialism -with the United States of America -is Ready to commit as crimes to maintain his hegemony in the region: so he did not come up then this
   <em>
    "Gulf that separates your legal world from our real world (...) This peace established by your system, maintained by the annihilation of millions of men in our peripheries of the outskirts".
   </em>
</p>
<p>
   The 40 years of incarceration that the relentlessness of the French state imposed on Georges Abdallah could not break the unshakable resistance of this fighter who fell into the hands of the enemy: despite the barbarism of this detention, this internationalist revolutionary and The communist that he is never denied anything from his fight which is also ours-anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, anti-fascist and anti-Zionist, in support of the Palestinian Revolution, to his glorious resistance, to popular masses in struggle and for The emancipation of oppressed peoples all over the world.
  </p>
<p>
   Georges Abdallah is not only a resistant; It is itself a symbol of the resistance and it is well for what it represents that the French state continues to keep it in prison despite the two court decisions authorizing its release. The cause of our comrade is intrinsically linked to our support for Palestine. That no action, initiative, gathering, demonstration happens without being chanted, displayed, written our requirement and in particular through this watchword which should never be truncated from its two components: "Palestine will live! Palestine will win ! Release Georges Abdallah! " - because one has gave himself entirely to his cause and the other cannot leave this torch of his resistance to the hands of the enemy. All those, in France and elsewhere, in solidarity with Palestine, must demand at every moment and wherever we are the liberation of this fighter of the Palestinian Liberation Movement. And what better support can we bring to the Palestinian resistance except by putting pressure on our own imperialism to tear from this enemy one of its historic fighters!
  </p>
<p>
   Since June 8, a new phase has opened up in this long battle that its support leads to its release: while mobilization, in the field, in the diversity of its expressions, continues to increase, Georges Abdallah agreed to launch a new legal offensive by filing a tenth request for liberation-expulsion to its country Lebanon. Let us support by our actions the approach of Georges Abdallah by making it resonate everywhere throughout the time of the examination of his new request and accentuate always the pressure on the French state by our ever more increased mobilization and at all times!
  </p>
<p>
   It is in this sense and taking into account this new phase that we call once again to
   <strong>
    An international action month
   </strong>
   For the release of Georges Abdallah

   Georges Abdallah is in prison for the political fight that has been his, for his positions and his ideals that he never ceased to proclaim and never deny. It was for his emancipation ideas that Georges Abdallah embarked on the struggle. It is for his ideas and resistance that he is still detained today. It is for his ideas and his revolutionary fight that we support him and that we demand his release! For victory or victory!
  </p>
<p>
   Palestine live, live and defeat! Release Georges Abdallah!
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Let's continue the fight! Let's free Georges Abdallah!
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    May a thousand solidarity initiatives flourish for his release!
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Honor to all those who fight for his release!
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
    It is together and only together, comrades, that we will defeat!

  Today's strike mobilization took place, with thousands of strikers, people and youth. The demonstration was attended by unions, student associations, bodies and political collectives. The body of the march with its slogans denounced the anti -populist policy of the system, the policy that has been crushing workers' rights, which is murdered, depriving youth for public and free studies for years. Indeed, solidarity with the Palestinian resistance was also expressed after a meeting with Palestinian fighters in the Propylaea.
 </p>
<p>
  The racing moves, with a common banner with student resistance and teacher movements, have intervened with notices, four -page and slogans, which emphasize that the "development" proposed by bourgeois democracy threatens and attacks the people and youth and express the need for the need. To unite the labor and agricultural movement with the student.

  At the same time, 2 banners of the same student associations were re -observed, even in different calls, again revealing the KNE and ESAK micro -political associations, which were revealed in conventions in the past. This is the unity that the reformists sell in the student world.
 </p>
<p>
  The presence of the police was challenging once again, which even after the end of the march tried to dismantle and terrorize the world.
 </p>
<p>
  The mass and the formation of the demonstration did not allow the various "games" of some with Molotovs to be generalized, while at the same time restricting and denounced the intervention by repressive forces.

  It is important to follow subsequent strikes, to support even more people, employees, students, students, ecclesiastical, allies against the system that murders and attacks. We are escalating our struggle to overthrow Pierrakakis.

  Great strike in Thessaloniki, with the participation of people and youth. Thousands, mostly young workers, students in mobilization, and many professors from the public sector have participated in the strike rallies. Important and dynamic is the presence of youth, which once again shows the searches and moods of race.

  Along the way, the issue of Tempi dominated by several forces, which was pervasive to many people involved, but on the part of the class march and the racing moves, an attempt was made to grasp this rage with class characteristics and especially with the issue of the BSEs. and wages, which was (initially) the main issue of strike.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  It becomes clear that this rage is "in the air", as there is no planning to unite and continue the races, just before strike we had the end of agricultural mobilizations, while in education there was a common planning of occupations and strikes. So today's strike also had the element of the "racing closure" with reference to the elections.

  Once again, the stance of the ECTH can be described as a strike. He declared a 4 -hour work stoppage at the last minute, for the eyes of the world. However, a significant number of workers has managed to strike through its sectoral associations, despite the climate of employer terrorism that has been in the city lately, with many layoffs.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The strike rallies were essentially two. That of Kamara, where forces of the extra -parliamentary left, anarchy, and some unions/bodies, and that of PAME's associations in the statue of Venizelos, were also gathered, where some forces of the left were also involved. The two marches met in OSE, where the police began to throw chemicals on a petty occasion. It was followed by a "confrontation" of a part of the anarchy with the MATs, resulting in the hunting of the march to the Kamara area. The blocks of the class march and the racing moves moved by, ending at the EKT Square.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The class march and the racing moves participated in the gathering of Kamara with composed blocks. The forces of the class march participated in the morning in strike rallies, such as that of Teleperformance and elsewhere, and organized interventions to massive the strike.

  In an interview, the President of the Republic Luiz Inacio said he intends to leave “for history” the military coup of 1964 and “play the country” forward. "This is already part of history, has already caused the suffering it caused, the people have gained the right to democratize this country." The speech took place on February 27, one month from the 60th anniversary of the regime.
 </p>
<p>
  The country's agent also said: “What I can't do is not know how to touch the story forward, always brooding, always brooding, that is, it is a part of the history of Brazil that we still don't have all the information, because There are missing people yet, because there are people who can find out. But I, honestly, I won't be brooding over and I will try to play this country forward. ”
 </p>
<p>
  Some may consider it reasonable. However, it is very curious to note that, in this regard, the president seems to conflict with what Hamilton Mourão thinks, the unsuspecting general of being a Democrat by principle: "War has excesses and these things are known," said the former vice president Bolsonaro, on 03/27/2019, referring to the crimes of the military dictatorship. “The Armed Forces fought Nazifascism, fought communism and
  <strong>
   This is past
  </strong>
  e
  <strong>
   It's part of the story
  </strong>
  ”. This is the hegemonic thesis in almost all the Brazilian military highlight, and they share both Bolsonaro's far-right, and the military right (the “legalists”) with Villas-Bôas and Mourão.
 </p>
<p>
  But Luiz Inácio, in turn, tries to demonstrate that - although we should forget the military regime - the truth is that scammers are being punished in their government. He said: “Remember a moment that a general was called by the Federal Police to give testimony? At no time were the military punished as they are now. ” Thus, he wants to convince us that there is no impunity for the crimes of the military today. And here are a half truth: rather punished to those who have plotted an institutional break for those months of 2022. But and as for the supporters who are supporters of “using the uniforms” to do politics, using the army and the other forces Reactionary Armeds to blackmail, intimidate, press and dissuade other institutions and governments, imposing their wishes to them? These, in fact, are not pockets and did not embark on institutional rupture: but they are also guilty of intervention in national political life, which is against the law (and, in this sense, it is not very exactly to call them legalists there ). They are also scammers, but for another method. These are Bolsonaro's precursors (as well as the example) of Bolsonaro: General Villas-Bôas, Mourão, Sérgio Etchegoyen and others, who have intimidated the other institutions since 2016 and led the country to such a delicate institutional situation.
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/villas-boas-a-admissao-de-culpa-de-um-comandante-golpista/">
   Even from preventing the current president from running the elections in 2018: or fell into oblivion that
   <em>
    tweet
   </em>
   of Villas-Bôas, a veiled threat that made Rosa Weber change his vote and refuse the
   <em>
    Habeas corpus
   </em>
   ?
  </a>
  If, in those gone, they have been unhealthy in political life because of the 2023-14 uprisings, does anyone believe that, in a more critical situation, these gentlemen opposed a military coup? There will be no punishment to them, surely. Here, too, conciliation will result in new scammers.
 </p>
<p>
  It is logical that treating those events such as “history”, as an irrelevant theme, is in the interest of those who have debts to get it right with the Brazilian people, on the one hand, and those who share today's same coup ideals of 1964. Luiz Inácio, Trying to appease the generals, the “nation's moderators”, raising the flag of “forgetting scars”, only gives more political margins for tomorrow's coup. In addition, he despises the struggle of family members of victims and missing politicians, who expected so much from his third government, hoping to remedy this
  <strong>
   historical debt
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  Luiz Inácio is not realized that the wound is still active.

  On February 20, Janderson Rocha Santos, 33,
  <strong>
</strong>
  He was murdered by a military police officer (PM) during a psychotic outbreak. A video of the event shows Janderson, unarmed and trance, walking towards the policeman. Shouting and with the gun pointed at the man, the PM orders a few times that the man puts his hands to his back and then fires against the victim, who falls to the floor.

</figure>
<p>
  Janderson had a diagnosis of schizophrenia since 25 and lived with his family in the Sol Nascente neighborhood, outskirts of DF. The region is considered by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) as the largest slum in the country.
 </p>
<p>
  The PM appeared on the scene after Janderson's mother, Dilza Santos, triggered the military around 9 pm asking for help to contain her son in an outbreak. But besides not helping the family, the PMs acted with truculence from beginning to end of the approach. The shots fired by the policeman hit the man in his chest and below his waist.
 </p>
<p>
  Shortly after the execution, police locked Janderson's mother at home and prevented any communication with relatives and family lawyer. Even with the clearly intimidating attitude, the family will fight for justice. In an interview with the G1 press monopoly, Dilza said she will not let her son's death pass in vain. The OAB Human Rights Commission said it will analyze the case.

<p>
  On February 1, the reactionary governor of the Federal District (DF), Ibaneis Rocha (MDB) stated during a speech in the Tribune of the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District (CLDF) that the Department of Transportation Secretariat of Transport and Mobility (Semob) It is coordinating a project that aims to end the function of collector in the Federal District (DF) urban buses, which would result in the dismissal of more than 5,200 workers.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition to mass unemployment, the plan also threatens the increase in exploration on drivers, who will have to perform the double-function of drivers and collectors. In Brazil, it is common that, in these cases, drivers, despite their folded work, do not receive additional.
 </p>
<p>
  John Jesus, president of Sittrater-DF, also denounces that the withdrawal of collectors, as well as an attack on workers, also affects all the people. “It also implies a larger delay in boarding and landing [passengers],” he says. This was the risk of increasing accidents by dividing attention that should not exist.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Cut of funds?
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The governor's justification is the old excuse of the "cut of funds." According to its data, the district government would save 20% of the approximately R $ 2 billion per year that the government pays for subsidy to public transport companies in the DF. The statement is contested by the Bus Union, which recently stated that no proof was presented to corroborate the indicated data.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, while pretending to be concerned with the budget for public transportation, Ibaneis and its ruling base hide that in November last year, R $ 142.9 million were approved in supplementary credit for bus companies. The approval occurred a month before the company Viação Marechal, with one of the biggest demands of public transportation in the DF, not working days claiming “lack of resources”. The same company received, alone. R $ 267 million of transfers from the government from January to November 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  Viação Marechal is also known for passengers for working with old vehicles, over ten years without changing. A serious discrepancy between the millionaire incentives received and the precarious service offered. Last year, passenger Julia Albuquerque Violato died after a bus, with no force to cross the train line, was hit by the rail vehicle.
 </p>
<p>
  The precariousness of public transportation in the DF is so clear that even Ibaneis Rocha himself had to assume in this same speech on the 1st that transport is not well evaluated by the population. Forget to say, however, that he is one of the great culprits for this fact, with his attacks on public transportation, as

</p>
<p>
  Trying to maneuver with the category, Ibaneis stated that collectors will have jobs maintained despite the end of the function, and that the plan will be discussed with unions. The promise was denied by workers. To Brazil, João Jesus stated that in addition to the union was not informed at any time, it would also be impossible for collectors to maintain their job. After all, “if jobs will be preserved, it is evident that the cost remains,” concludes João.

  Organizing the struggle of women only against male domination in the current system and reducing gender oppression liberation will be incomplete in terms of free realization of women's identity. In fact, we must recognize that this approach feeds many misunderstandings. This approach reaches the point of seeing the areas where women are at a disadvantage due to their gender identity within a limit. In this perspective, the desire to make the existing system suitable for women under the titles of family women, women in state mechanism and women in society. Here, class strata and gender contradictions are ignored in the imperialist capitalist system and the struggle for women's equality with men, whom they oppose. However, it is a fact that constantly demonstrates that gender equality is not possible in the existing system.

   The effects of bourgeois women's movement
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-889d43a99f1b9570d477e0b8a5bb772c">
  With the transition to capitalism, we see that the positions of women and men in the domestic economy have begun to change and the place of women in social production has begun to expand. However, in our country, the place of women in the domestic economy remains complex as a result of the semi -feudal social structure. The strong influence of feudal values continues to limit the masses of women outside the social sphere, specifically at home. The domestic economy provides us with data on the subordinate position of women in society and production. We can see the reflection of production relations very clearly here. We pay attention to women in the home economy because the moment when women begin to participate in social production is the same time that they begin to leave home. In other words, the capitalist mode of production is a positive step towards the emancipation of women. But this should not lead to the idea that there is equality between men and women in terms of participation in production. We have seen reflections of this idea in the World Women's Movement: with the development of capitalism, policies based solely on identity began to occur and class contradictions darkened. This, in fact, led to a lack of understanding of the exploitative-exploited relationship between men and women. The distinctions between bourgeois women, proletarian women and women from other oppressed class strata were annulled and the demands were unified. In these points in common, the oppression of women in the class to which they belonged became a discussion, and the emphasis on sexual oppression as the most inclusive characteristic of women became the foreground. Agendas such as paid and unpaid work, the care of family members and the socialization of domestic tasks were filed as if these problems had been solved.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-78202d815d3ee9c8064eea80c9caba98">
  These problems, which coincide with class oppression under capitalism, have not been resolved. So what was the source of this change in women's movements? Neoliberalism. The speech that some problems are above ideologies, which followed the cry of the end of ideologies, also addressed the question of the liberation of women. We do not separate this from the return to socialism, the defeats of the socialist movement, the decline of social liberation struggles, because this problem, which is a matter of revolution, will surely have its share of these setbacks. The "increase" in the mobilization of the masses while undergoing an ideological-political regression seems absurd, but it is understandable. Here, two anti -mumist ideas point to the same place: the attitude of the movement of bourgeois women is almost identical to the new design that rulers have prepared for women, half of society. The rulers deceive women who do not want to be among their "gradderos" creating a system that suits them. And bourgeois democracy exhibits the rarest examples of this!
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-eba42fc2435605a3fc1c706d67824e60">
  Although the women's movement has been in decline for some time, it has achieved a serious mobilization of the masses. The massive mobilization of women's actions is not a bad thing. It is only important that the masses are aware of what measures or what are against. Politization exists, although as a tendency at the beginning of this process, and a political movement of women is inevitable with systematic work; But while the masses of women who have not become a "movement" are worried about the "foam" agenda, they will be diluted on their agenda. The silence that followed protests for abortion rights in the United States and Poland is proof of this. Again, individualization and reduction of women's release to the individual is one of the most common phenomena. A "conscience" is pumped around the experiences of a single woman, usually a well -known and famous woman. Then the interests of that woman are discussed, the women's liberation struggle is exploited and attributed to a person or a group of people. It is an indication that it is more about the contradictions in the world of individual women instead of the apparent contradiction of gender in society and in the masses of women in particular. Yes, women are also oppressed within their own class. But here it is incomprehensible not to see this fact: bourgeois women, whether bosses, artists, public figures, consciously express gender inequality to obtain sympathy and support between people's masses and especially among the masses of women. They say they are subject to the inequality of opportunities because they are women. If they have a problem with the male domination of the system, it is because they cannot obtain the position they want in class exploitation! If there is also a movement of bourgeois women that support them, the consciousness of the masses will continue to erase. Most of the time is the movement of bourgeois women in itself that puts this on the agenda of the masses! We have experienced this with Meral Akşener, but the problem we are talking about is not just a problem in Turkey. In fact, it is the reflection in Turkey of the Bourgeois Movement that continues to develop in the United States and the West. Such approaches, which distract the masses of women from their main agenda, continue to create more space for themselves under the influence of neoliberalism. It is obvious that the spaces we are talking about belong to the system and are far from the attitude of the class. In other words, no matter how much the slogan "not to feminism that divides class", the expression "feminism that unites classes!" It would be more precise.

   The importance of a Marxist perspective

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0735b65f342f99b45a46d0d61019b89c">
  The essence of bourgeois women's movement is antirmarxism. Therefore, addressing the issue of women's emancipation, it does not point to the abolition of private property and its practices do not meet this objective. Being anti-Marxist avoids analyzing and understanding contradiction. Without examining all sides of a contradiction, you cannot draw a correct conclusion about that contradiction.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-65655f1fb621cd36ee281d068efe414e">
  The problem of liberation of women in capitalist countries and semi-colonial, semi-feudal countries is not the same. Although it is essentially based on private property, it has specific aspects. For example, the problem of liberation of women in the United States and Turkey cannot be solved in the same way and by the same method because the contradiction is not in the same way. In semi-colonial and semi-feudal Turkey, to abolish private property, it is first necessary to get rid of imperialist domination and the remains of feudalism. Because one of the specific aspects of the problem of women's liberation in Turkey is feudalism. This specific aspect will also change after the revolution, as Mao said: "The processes change, old processes and contradictions disappear and new processes and contradictions arise, and, consequently, the methods to solve contradictions vary."
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a801c1bdb0b5035713d1f595ed361bfb">
  In terms of the emancipation of women, it is so subjectivism and dogmatism to affirm that the emancipation of women in countries in several stages of the revolution will have the same characteristics as to seek the community/total unity of a woman. Like each problem, women's question must include class differences, and as each revolution, the liberation of women in different countries has peculiarities. Each contradiction is unique and the emancipation of women in each country will be determined by the revolution of that country according to the contradiction it has ...

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0527b2474801213d1bbf8250f1ef0e72">
  The proletarian woman loads the weight of the double oppression on her shoulders: the capitalist and the patriarchal. On the one hand he is a workers, suffering the capitalist exploitation of wage labor. On the other hand, she is a woman under the class society where the patriarchy develops, suffering the reactionary force of custom and tradition, which maintains the yoke of domestic work once her workday ends.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-288ffe12e43069d1b206809702fdc00e">
  And this is not enough, the capitalist and patriarchal exploitation suffered by the proletarian woman is intertwined, still making the living conditions worse. The proletarian woman concentrates, in the labor market, in those sectors with worse working conditions and suffers dismembrance, humiliation and sexual harassment. Meanwhile, in the domestic field, it suffers the consequences of these bad working conditions: it cannot reconcile family life and is forced to work with departure and/or partial days. From the relationship between capitalist and patriarchal oppression, at the time of imperialism in its greater phase of decomposition, it develops the most cruel forms of discrimination, vexation and humiliation. Even of sexual slavery, such as prostitution.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-73fdb2df023847b2c26852760ca872b4">
  Given this general situation, the panorama does not improve in the Spanish context. The salary gap - the structural difference between what a man and a woman charges in the same jobs - remains. Although the Government, the State institutions and the union domes - which follow bourgeois feminism - affirm that the salary gap has fallen, are based solely and exclusively on data from the increase in the minimum interprofessional salary (SMI), leaving out millions of women They work in black. The right to abortion is continuously attacked reactionary and ultra -critical groups -directly or indirectly financed by institutions, parties of the bourgeoisie and by the Catholic Church -, which carry out harassment and demolition campaigns in front of the abortive clinics, blackmailing in all possible ways To women who want to abort. The few public nurseries that are - and not in all cities - hinders the lives of mothers, especially single mothers.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bee89de5e40f27dead4ae4549ced3a6c">
  We cannot lose sight of youth, whose culture and way of thinking is hard beaten by the ideological offensive of imperialism, developing cruel forms of patriarchal oppression towards girls and adolescents. Several cases of violation have occurred in pack for children under 16. If the harassment and hypersexualization that undergoes girls and adolescents in schools and institutes, new technological tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) are used as blackmail tools and extortion tools are not little harassment and hypersexualization. Thus, the case of how a group of students distributed false photographs created by the where they were naked companions were sounded. During the class society, imperialism and patriarchal violence, those advances that should be good for humanity, such as AI, are used for imperialist war, sexual harassment and other type of patriarchal violence.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b530e52ea15dbb2e24ae4b046ef53a05">
  It is visible as the hypersexualization caused by the canons or standards of patriarchal beauty affects youth, but not only to it. The proletarian woman, of all ages, is strongly subject to this social pressure. It is notorious how the number of aesthetic operations from 2014 to 2021 has increased by 215%, where it is women who carry out these operations (85% of the operations are intended for women). The most common operations are chest implants, rhinoplasty, liposuction and modifications in the face in general. The large increase in aesthetic operations is due to a reduction in the price of surgery and in the popularization of installments, added to strong patriarchal pressure. This cruel is patriarchal violence.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4598f078eb1a86bad06cad05c7f7e190">
  All these cases are practical examples of how at the time of imperialism, in the phase of its greatest decomposition, the cultural expression of patriarchal violence becomes even more atrocious and humiliating for proletarian women.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4bbd1ebeb7b9b60ba4399f8fad4ace48">
  Patriarchal violence, in all its forms, whips women in all areas of her life. In 2023, 101 macho murders were officially counted. In what we have of 2024 there are at least 10. There is no defense against violated or attacked women. The "most progressive government" government claims to be a feminist, but does not defend the proletarian woman in the face of abuse at work, does not break the yoke that binds to the home or protects it from those who hits or viola them.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-cd1ddb4de41424110d7d0024fe320509">
  Being "victim of gender violence" by bourgeois justice is a maze where many women do not get it. Either because they do not have economic resources -we know that free justice provided by the State is something that does not work in real life -because institutions do not guarantee the right to complaint -how will you be able to denounce a woman if The police laugh at her or not believe it? There are few cases of violations at the police station, prisons or foreigners' internment centers (CIE). Are you going to trust a woman attacked in the aggressors?- Or either for anything else.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-84cd1a6c1606767b42b54b48eb29554e">
  Even trusting bourgeois justice, being considered "victim of gender violence" and ending up condemning the aggressor macho, that does not guarantee anything. There are few news that in the past 2023 we could see how a convicted of gender violence murders to his ex -partner for revenge. Those convicted lead a normal life beyond punishment - him and punctual - that at the time they are imposed. There are even regional and national deputies who were sentenced in a final sentence, are presented to the elections and are elected!
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-662826edfb88954df34e5cd490e9dd41">
  The conclusion is that the proletarian woman who rebels and wants to cut ties with the aggressor with whom she lives, cannot. If you denounce, you are not assured of the victory. If you get the legal victory, the protection of a punctual revenge is not insured. If you have children, you are not insured to keep the children and the aggressor can have the total or shared custody of them.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-300530ee41819c2de13805518f15dbd7">
  We cannot forget how imperialism, Spanish imperialism in this case, is primed with the women of the semi -dependent and semi -feudal countries dominated by imperialism. The most common prostitute profile in Spain is that of a Colombian woman between 23 and 28 years old. More than 90% of prostituted women are foreign, mainly from these oppressed countries (Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa). In Huelva, the laborers of the strawberry - which are mainly Moroccan - suffer days of misery, along with numerous cases of sexual violations and abuse they have denounced. Latin American women, throughout the country, are the most employed and sought -after profile for cleaning and domestic care, often being internal in the residence where they live and in semi -cutting conditions.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ebe0241c2ae658405d04f11e461ccf53">
  The "most progressive government" government, the government that claims to be a feminist, does not protect proletarian women. And he will never, this or any other government, because due to the very essence of a government of this nature (which manages the interests of the imperialist bourgeois state), he cannot end the nature of the patriarchal problem (originated in the class society and which develops in the time of monopoly capitalism, that is, imperialism). The government can only mitigate the problem, and not even effectively!
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-305fa471a88c9d7494c20b06669e39b9">
  Faced with bourgeois feminism in all its variants, there was no purely proletarian feminism that imposed the class position of the proletariat, which is none other than the organization, mobilization and politicization of proletarian women to destroy imperialism and class society to destroy Thus, patriarchy. The proletarian woman can only free themselves as a class, because the problems she suffers are directly derived from the class society.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7eec4dd1764310025c42c102edc02172">
  Faced with bourgeois feminism, we must defend, fly and apply proletarian feminism. The proletarian woman cannot be a slave for much longer. The centuries of oppression, humiliation, violence and exploitation in all its forms must be sent to the place from which it should never leave: the dump of history.
 </p>

  Today's strike and demonstration in Heraklion is very massive.
 </p>
<p>
  Although the Heraklion Labor Center did not participate and private sector workers were not able to participate, except for a few primary unions.
 </p>
<p>
  So despite the obstacles of the GSEE and EPI sold out, the workers with their great participation showed that the problem is not on the basis but in the leadership of the labor movement. A leadership that is opposite and against those who are supposed to represent, and that all that interests and concerns it is to brake the movement, sow frustration and reproduce the ideology of "nothing".
 </p>
<p>
  The participation of youth, students and students was great. Also of teachers, hospital, private employees and taxi drivers.
 </p>
<p>
  The class march with intervention Tuesday night at Lion Square with banners, Dundukas, calling for the people of Heraklion to participate in today's strike and rally. Along the way he participated with a massive and militant block.

  The history of the Spanish communist Aurora Picornell, still little known internationally, is a reason for an immense pride for communists of all times and continents due to the remarkable ideological, political and organic work carried out by it in the hard and difficult years of the 1930s in the 1930s in Europe, particularly in Spain. Throughout his short life and his powerful revolutionary and communist career, especially in this complex and winding scenario, he fulfilled their responsibilities and raised the decisive role of communist women in the struggle for the inapplicable future of society without classes, the luminous communism.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-869fbb184748c73c4832b40af158ff3f">
  After April 14, 1931, on the day of the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, and after the republican success in the municipal elections, a period of great political effervescence in Spain was opened, as well as in the postwar Europe, with A magnificent victory of the glorious October revolution, 1917. The Democrats, the progressive and, especially the communists, including communist women, tirelessly developed their tasks to build new communist parties, fight against revisionism as the main danger and promote The massive struggle against imperialism and local reactionaries.

<strong>
   The beginnings of Aurora Picornell
  </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6e240aefa437564a0a50529ea471ccb9">
  Born on October 1, 1912, in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, the largest of the Balearic Islands, located in the Mediterranean, east of Spain, Aurora Picornell Women can be considered a paradigm of young communists, directly committed to the fight of the classes, and in it, with the politicization and organization of the women of the people. Being the sixth among the seven children of Gabriel Picornell and Joana female, a proletarian and secular family, seen by all as on the left, soon got involved in the class struggles that exploded at the time in Mallorca, accompanied by all her family that already It was involved in the Communist Party. Aurora and her younger sister, called Freedom, received expressive names, which could be interpreted as symbols of the future of the political and social transformation that yearned for their parents.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-54700f902b6b7a073fa395e2d7b0b7d0">
  From an early age, Aurora participated in various activities in defense of the rights of workers and working women also taking a clear option for secularism in a country of strong Catholic tradition. Therefore, the first association in which Aurora joined was the "Lay Liga de Mallorca" being chosen its director during the 1930s. Significant fact of the type of life chosen by Aurora is that she was not only the only woman who participated in The management, but also the only partner of the organization at that time. From the beginning of his work, he encouraged her to give denunciation talks about the situation of women's oppression in her hometown, to encourage them to fight for their rights. The young Aurora never stopped maintaining political relations with the workers or also participating in meetings with the communists of the island, at the same time that she organized support campaigns to the families of many dead workers, or injured, in serious accidents at work, whose managers always remained unpunished.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-de423805e086576f1d7af1adeae32eec">
  His solidarity, social and political work, carried out with courage and challenging attitude towards a closed society to liberating ideas, was recognized in an open letter from the Spanish journalist and writer Miguel Ángel Colomar, in which he referred to Aurora as a “courageous young man who always adds his name to all civic manifestations to rescue the freedom of secular slavery ”.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c50714101f9bcf7cac286683788cc5e2">
  Influenced by his father and his brother Joan, militants of the Communist Party of Spain - PCE from before the Republic, also having as an intellectual reference atheoth Martí, of the "Lay Association", greatly influenced his good relationship, even if he ranged, with The PCE.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6c8223b4ffcca6d9d4a556e8c46e8c75">
  Another reference in Aurora's initial formation was someone who, at the end of the 1920s, promoted several women's fighting initiatives under the name of Margarita Leclerc. Actually, Leclerc was one of the many literary and journalistic pseudonyms of José Antonio Ruiz Rodríguez Méndez, also known as Max Bembo, who moved for Mallorca with his partner Teresa Herrero Ruiz. Feminism, brave for the time, of the writer and Leclerc activist deeply marked the young Picornell, who already denoted an unusual commitment to the class, especially with the women of the class. And with just 16 years he openly announced that, next to his companions, he had assumed the great task of fighting for the emancipation of women, under the slogan: “The emancipation of women is the work of women! Aurora's positions were enormously transgressive for the time, especially on an island where a strong and backward conservatism predominated clerical. Thus became, with all its courage, a symbol of the imminent political changes in Mallorca particularly, and in Spain in general.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9af27ff38bb4cd03b173c9be27014dc4">
  The victory of the Russian Revolution of 1917 was celebrated with revolutionary enthusiasm worldwide, being that the arrival of the proletariat to power for the first time in history, it had a deep impact on Europe. After the first great imperialist war ended, many were involved in different struggles that exploded in the streets of the cities, especially young people, schools and universities, marking a great confrontation with conservative values and customs, in struggle for a new future.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-583a5f1e728c42d1bf959b7d23da88e5">
  Thanks to its practical activities and also in its studies, Aurora did not take long to completely assume the ideology of the international proletariat, which in its development process was Marxism-Leninism. And he joined the PCE when he was only 19. In a short time he became the best -known communist militant in Mallorca, not only for his personal charisma, but especially due to his firm class commitment and work capacity. This, in addition to the close political collaboration that he later developed with his life and struggle, the famous Comintern agent, Heriberto Quiñones González, very politically persecuted and very attacked by the reaction and the revisionists. And being a couple, the political and private life of Aurora is totally intertwined with quiñones, during the time he played in Spain. And although the intense history of Quiñones must be told, in another text, many of its notable actions as delegate of the Comintern are also part of the life of Aurora.

  In April 1931, before the municipal elections, Aurora wrote the "open letter to the women of Mallorca", encouraging them to convince their relatives, of the male, to vote for the Republican candidates against what he called "local cacicism." That year, women could not even vote, neither in Spain, nor in many other countries, such as in Brazil. And even without aligning with the official line of the PCE of the time, he wrote another article, with a similar content, for the body of the party, "our word." Aurora wanted to fight for the construction of a working and peasant republic, taking the Soviet Union as an example.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a17b85a98c53e67fb8cb27efccb23c49">
  Between the spring and the summer of 1931, Aurora published its first articles in the republican magazine «Citizenship», through which it criticized Catholic moralism and denounced the bad living and education conditions that persisted in some small private schools, households in Elders and correctional houses of palm managed by Catholic nuns. After its first text, published on January 3, 1931, the magazine included a note that celebrated the incorporation of the new collaborator who, however, would move away from this magazine shortly after.

  On April 14, 1931, the Second Republic was proclaimed with the departure of King Afonso XIII of Spain. The Second Republic lasted in Spain between April 14, 1931 and April 1, 1939, marked the lives of Spanish revolutionaries and, at the same time, challenged them deeply. The Spanish communists of the PCE initially rejected the proclamation of the Second Republic because they considered that it did not mean an important political step forward, nor to the destruction of capitalism, nor to the realization of the bourgeois democratic revolution. To the extent that the PCE, taking into account that the Spanish bourgeoisie could not understand the character of the revolution and, much less, to achieve this, he concluded that the Second Republic was then a counterrevolution.

<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-573f05441c257fe9797875a2ab508ae2">
  In addition, class contradictions, as well as interimperialist contradictions, will be exacerbated greatly on the eve of the beginning of the Second Imperialist World War. And in the fire of these intense contradictions, the Spanish fascists, led by General Francisco Franco, gave a military coup on July 18, 1936 exactly against the Second Republic. This was the trigger for the explosion of the Spanish Civil War, which lasted until April 1939, when Franco won his final victory, thus beginning, in 1939, the fascist regime, whose brutal and criminal actions affected the Spanish people, for more than 30 years.

  The important thing about all this was that Aurora's concerns, described, on the one hand, in the face Comrade Stalin, was answered by her with the elevation of her ideological and political commitment. Deploying and applying the ideology of the international proletariat, transforming his communist ideas into a decision to give his life to the revolution, working more than ever, tirelessly.

  Shortly after his affiliation to the PCE, he went to military in the communist youth of Molinar (a neighborhood known at the time as the "little Russia"), acting as an outstanding local leader. His first public intervention as a communist militant occurred on September 12, 1931, during the XVII International Youth Week. In this act, Aurora talked about the situation of women in proletarian Russia pointing out that “women have the same rights as men; Women work only six hours a day; They win the same as men; And that their children are the most respected children in the world because they will be the men of tomorrow, ”as registered by the newspaper

  The multiple achievements and important conquests of the town in the Soviet Union after 1917 had a great impact on Europe and also in the Spanish State. What the Soviets did it in the first years after victory was a remarkable example for Aurora, which was always shown to the masses, especially the women of the town, the reality dreamed by it throughout Spain and everyone.

  One of his first tasks as a member of the communist youth was to mobilize the children of communist families and, thus, at the end of December 1931, a nucleus of red pioneers was created, with about 30 members, who made a beautiful and beautiful Brilliant march through the streets of the neighborhood, despite the constant coercion and threats of the Catholic nuns.

  , where he called the young proletarians to join in the struggle for their rights. His first articles in his section still focused on the denunciation of clericalism and consciousness of women; because he still maintained a certain support for the Second Republic. In his case, the relatively slow traffic between the different political trends was explained by the political relations he maintained, both with republicanism and with communism.

  On December 24, 1931, in Palma the radio of the communist youth was created, to make the propaganda and the defense of communist ideas, which had the well -known voice of Aurora and the direction of the so -called Reds of Molin to the family of Catalina Pascual and her sisters, Antonia and Maria Pascual, who, together with Aurora, were the ones that promoted communism in the Molinar neighborhood.

  The great political objective of Las Rojas de Molinar was to overcome the barriers of the misinformation imposed by the media under direct command of the Catholic Church, which promoted satanization of communism through simple messages aimed at women. The absurdities reach the point of saying that "communism erases human feelings" and that "communist mothers ate their children starting with the limbs", to the maximum to propagandize that Lenin had declared that "the love of the parents was Something unhappy »and that Alexandra Kollontai considered" the family as a rag of the past. " After 20 communists were arrested at a clandestine meeting, which was being held in Madrid, these same reactionary bodies were scandalized with the presence of a young woman among them, and publicly launched the question: “How explains the presence of a young woman Spanish woman at a Bolshevik meeting? ” The comrades promoted a strong debate and a great political work with the radio of the communist youth against so many falsehoods and nonsense.

  In Mallorca, the local committee of PCE was marginalized and strongly attacked by repression since 1929, when he only had 5 militants. Throughout the year 1930, reconstruction was directed by the Communist Federation of Catalan-Balale, and in May 1931, the Mallorcan communists distanced themselves from this link with the Catalans, because they formed a revisionist, opportunistic and right-wing fraction, called the labor block AND CAMPESINO - BOC.

  He opened a female section, with the denunciation of the bad working conditions and life of the workers' women, it is when the female nucleus in the islands was also developed with other communists, several quite positive political works. The political confrontation with republicanism was really difficult and the local women's commission, at the time, continued with small advances until 1933.

  The PCE was also in difficulties to articulate a model of trade union organization according to the Red Trade Union, which led to communist union policy to develop various experiences in the republican era, based almost only on specific local influences. However, the communists of Mallorca had a solid presence in the construction union, because the father and children of the Picornell family participated in relevant positions of the wood and metallurgy union.

  Aurora, in turn, focused his work on the area of clothing clothing, in whose factories the workers of Palma were extremely exploited. She was one of the founders and also the most important leader of the tailoring union, founded in January 1931, which had a more higher number of women in relation to men. The struggle for the reduction of working hours and for better salaries extended throughout the year, while there were constant complaints about the bad working conditions suffered by workers. Aurora, always very active, participated in a meeting held at the Casa del Pueblo de Palma, when he spoke in favor of the union of the working class. She stressed that, if this objective was not achieved, the workers and workers would soon be run over by the bourgeois and the government of the bourgeois (working culture; 12-12-1931)

  Aurora applied constant work for the organization and affiliation of women in communist ranks as a strong strategic objective of the PCE. Taking Engels as a base, Aurora defended the need for the total destruction of imperialism as a path to female emancipation and joined the international communist movement in the struggle for the world proletarian revolution. Many texts on the female issue began to be published in the party propaganda body, being written directly by comrades but signed, for security, with pseudonyms. So he also reinforced his co -optation proposal of more and more communist women in the PCE.

  Aurora Picornell became known as the Mallorcan passionate, from 1931, when it became a powerful mobilizer of the communist revolutionaries, following this same political commitment during the Second Republic, until she was cowardly murdered, with 25 years, on the 5th of January 1937. However, it is worth mentioning that in his brief career and, particularly, in his last years, the life and struggle of the young Mallorcan passionate has very little in common with the life of the internationally known passionate of Spain , Dolores Ibárruri, who was the general secretary of the PCE in 1942, after the death of José Díaz, a position he held until 1960, when Santiago Carrillo happened. Dolores Ibárruri, unlike the young Aurora Picornell, became a renegade revisionist and, therefore, is one of those responsible for the hard attack of the PCE to the Communist International and Comrade Stalin, and other types of serious problems created for The Spanish communists.

  The silence that fell on the agitated militancy of Aurora Picornell in the course of the next four decades of the Francoist victory can be explained by the destruction, almost total, of the labor movement in Mallorca and by the murder of the clandestine communist resistance, occurred in 1948 .

  In addition, several urban reforms made in Palma destroyed the original Molinar neighborhood, very degraded after the years. The buildings were demolished, making the vestiges and memories of the streets where Aurora and his family were born, opening the space for the transformation of the famous and very expensive tourist center that is today.

  The famous Comintern agent who historically met as Heriberto Quiñones González arrived in Palmas, Mallorca, in 1931. He soon contacted the Picornell family becoming welcomed on a Christmas night. Like other agents, it had been sent by Comintern to Spain to direct the structuring and consolidation of the Communist International Section in Spain

  After having worked in Argentina, where, as stated, he collaborated directly with Vittorio Codovilla, Quiñones also maintained a close connection with the Asturian colony in the country, which allowed him to learn well Castilian to guarantee greater veracity to his documentation of his documentation of Spanish nationality, used to arrive in Spain in October 1930. After Argentina, he went through France, where he was expelled, and then went to Spain, first arriving in Barcelona. Quiñones worked with another known member of the Comintern, the Swiss Edgar Woog, better known as Alfred Stirner, Secretary of Latin American Affairs of the Communist International and remained close to the main delegate of Comintern in Spain, also Swiss Jules Humberto Droz.

  He arrested many times, Quiñones was expelled from the Spanish territory on August 22, 1931. But he soon returned to the country to settle in Mallorca, where he contributed to the expansion of the work of the communists on the island. It was during his first stage in the country that began his love relationship with Aurora Picornell. It is reported that the couple would have married in Valencia, but before the judge, in 1936, Aurora claimed to be single, while he, in several statements after other arrests, also declared themselves single. Then they moved to the city of Valencia, where they lived together and very close to the maximum manager of the local communist committee. Aurora worked in the tailoring sector and also joined the young communists of Valencia, with the pseudonym of Amaro Pino. His return to the Balearic Islands took place in 1933, at the beginning of the electoral campaign of the first election in which Spanish women could vote. Aurora was then 23 years old, the age that allowed her to vote and she, like other Spanish women, made this new right in a marked decisive vote. In the islands, these elections caused a bitter result on the left, to the extent that it clearly benefited the reactionary candidates and defenders of right -wing positions.

  The communists of the Balearic Islands had to face many difficulties in the period of 1931-1933, a reformist Bienna, with many persecutions made by the Government. The triumph of the right in the 1933 elections opened a period of rectification and reforms, known as the radical-caedist biennium or black biennium of the Second Republic

For the communists it was a complex period during which they had to go to hiding and, throughout the year, new proposals favorable to a certain unit of action with other leftist forces were slowly being introduced in the PCE.

  As soon as the Balearic section, the PCE was characterized at this stage by an acute sectarianism due to its low theoretical and weak formation of Marxism. But in any case, with the work done in this biennium, the party achieved success in the areas of youth and union, which meant the creation of an important basis for greater local development.

  In the period of 1931-1933, the communists of the island became a reference for the most combative workers sectors. But it was only in the last years of the Second Republic that Aurora Picornell and Heriberto Quiñones became key figures to the communist movement on the island. Since the beginning of 1934, the communist policy developed and promoted by the Quiñones in Mallorca was based on the formation of groups of the so -called single front for the Fight against Fascism and Imperialist War. The strategic line of the Communist International proposed to attract the base militancy of other left -wing organizations, at the same time that was attacked to the Directorate of the Spanish Socialist Party - PSOE and the National Workers' Central - CNT.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0c2007a6d32014e01b6fdd897a271ec7">
  Quiñones led the fight against a former leader of the PCE, Pere Antoni Bauza Servera, who soon left the party to organize, in Mallorca, the labor and peasant block. Aurora once again summoned women to join the struggles, obtaining the creation of the single front in Menorca. With the reactivation of the PCE in 1934, it was possible to form a local female cell composed of eight women, and the agitation made by Aurora influenced the subsequent development of the communist movement in Menorca, which was very intense during the civil war.

In this scenario, the fascist threat grew again in the old continent.

Thousands of women served on battle fronts, many of them killed or arrested after the defeat of the conflict.

  With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the city of Mallorca fell into the hands of the Falangists contrary to the Republican regime, and the young Aurora Picornell soon was trapped in the house of the town and imprisoned in the Women's Prison in Mallorca. In the well -known night of the Magi, on January 5, 1936, she was taken from prison by speech, in the law that took her to the convent of Montuiri, where she was brutally tortured and killed on the same night, along with others Four comrades with whom he fought a lot: Catalina Flaquer Pascual, her daughters Antonia Pascual Flaquer and Maria Pascual Flaquer, and Belarmina Rodríguez, all the Reds of Molinar.

  It was quite common at the time that the communists gave their children representative names of their class ideology. So it was that the only daughter of Aurora and Quiñones was called Octubrina Roja. The franchise regime was found to officially and impartially change the beautiful and expressive name of the baby, chosen by its parents, by the name of Francisca, in a tax and absurd act. Octubrina Roja still crawled when her parents were cowardly killed by the fascists. After marrying and having two daughters, whom he called Joana and Aurora, Octubrina Roja died when he was still very young, fighting the bad living conditions that the communists and their families faced during the fascist regime.

The active presence of communist women in the revolutionary struggle has been greater than what is disseminated, but it is still little.

    All evils 
 endlessly that the proletariat suffers and the people in that country have an origin, 
 A cause, in capitalist restoration. Therefore, in that historical process of 
 Restoration-Contrastation, which is being lived there as a war of 
 national resistance, which corresponds to the communists, in this country 
 Also, it is to reconstitute its party, as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist party 
 militarized, which transforms such resistance into popular war not only for 
 release the invader country but to counteract, that is, to culminate 
 This chapter of the democratic revolution and develop the revolution 
 proletarian and restore the dictatorship of the proletariat. This has to be done 
 Amid the fight against foreign intervention, the country's division in 
 spheres of influence of superpowers and imperialist powers, against

</div>
<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The first pages of the great print today are all concentrated 
 on the outcome of the elections in Sardinia.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We don't think 
 that the elections are currently the tool to change things, just as we don't think that the elections in our country are really 
 democratic, but they are, instead, as Marx says, to choose between candidates who 
 they have to do the interests of the dominant class and this applies to the 
 center -right candidates as well as for center candidates 
 left.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is 
 it also became clear to the consistent masses of the population, dei 
 proletarians, of the poor masses of our country, so much so that the 
 natural response to this situation - or the non -response - was 
 the massive abstentionism. This massive abstentionism is 
 check now in all elections, to a greater or lesser extent a 
 depending on the type of elections.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Even the elections 
 In Sardinia they have seen a slight growth of abstentionism 
 compared to the previous regional ones. These are quite things 
 clear.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The system 
 politician of the parties in Italy and the governments that are born they are 
 all governments at the service of the owners and the dominant class and in 
 General what they say in the elections is not realized. All 
 What they promise to proletarians and masses is not realized. 
 Everything they promise to the masters and the dominant class 
 It is realized. Not only that, but also what they do not promise, that not 
 they say in the elections, once they are in power they do it without 
 no scruple and boast all this as if they were “promises 
 electoral "," it is a vote that sent us to power, it is the vote that 
 It allows us to do, in the end, everything we want ”.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now the elections 
 In Sardinia they are not different from the elections of all kinds of type 
 that we have had in recent years, nor will they be different from 
 future elections.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are for a 
 new really democratic state in which proletarian workers, the 
 popular masses can freely elect their representatives in 
 a picture in which, however - it is clear - that the interests of the proletarians e 
 of the masses must prevail over the interests of the masters and the 
 exploiters, parasites. This possibility is not in the present 
 electoral system and therefore this is not what we can today 
 speak.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  However the 
 electoral result in Sardinia is a political result from 
 carefully evaluate in the context of the current political situation. 
 In this sense it is also a positive result for us. Positive from 
 point of view of proletarians and masses, from the point of view 
 of the social and political opposition to this government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two factors there 
 they seem important: the government parties, through a clash between 
 gangs between them, gave birth to a candidate who is in substance is 
 been defeated. The center -right candidate was defeated 
 Because imposed by Meloni. So it is also a personal defeat 
 of the Meloni and the party that represents it. It is also a defeat 
 of the coalition because the party that wanted to express the 
 candidate, renewing the mandate, the League, made fire and 
 flames before the elections for the candidate Solinas to remain the 
 candidate-president, then Meloni set himself with the support of 
 Forza Italia and the candidate Solinas of the League has been set aside.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As a result 
 concrete, an evident part of the League electorate voted the 
 Lists but did not vote for the candidate of Fratelli d'Italia.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's not that we 
 We think the League candidate was better, Solinas is a 
 criminal, is a candidate also investigated by the judiciary for the 
 way in which he managed the Region, for the link with illegal affairs. 
 But this contradiction in the row of the dominant coalition is 
 was a weak ring of the center -right parties and of these 
 rings there are several in all elections and in management 
 also daily of this government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Everything that 
 feeds the division in the government, in the dominant class, is 
 Objectively positive. On the other hand, the vote in Sardinia expresses, 
 In the band of those who voted, a clear no to the government and a clear yes 
 Also to the figure of the center -left candidate.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The candidate, a 
 difference of other candidates of the center -left, at least in the electoral phase, is 
 characterized by a more radical position of social opposition 
 and politics at the local level, in Sardinia, and nationally against 
 The Meloni government. Rightly this candidate spoke of 
 Fascists to the government and rightly appealed to anti -fascism 
 Against this government, coming out of Mrs. Meloni, irrelevant that he has 
 disturbed a significant part of the electorate it saw 
 This mixture of presumption and arrogance and has had greater reasons 
 To convince himself that he is a fascist and that he had not been voted.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other question 
 is that the candidate does not 
 It was part of the extablish of the Democratic Party and this is also a value 
 added, because the establishment of the Democratic Party, in most of the 
 cases, certainly does not represent an alternative to the government of 
 center -right. So it was not part of this establishment, it was 
 more linked to the 5 Star Movement and to Conte, he used well 
 This "third" figure of his to conduct an election campaign 
 more radical and clearer. As we have 
 appreciated that one of his first statements was full 
 denunciation and solidarity with students attacked in Pisa and logic 
 of public order management as a police state, modern 
 Fascism, by Salvini who puts his face and Meloni 
 who is the great direction or the contact person of all this dirt of 
 which we have already talked about yesterday's counter -information.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So this 
 vote weakens the government, for now, and strengthens social opposition 
 and politics at least within the framework of the institutions and the electorate.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For us 
 The social and political opposition is the one that moves outside the 
 Parliament, is the one expressed for example from the 100,000 they have 
 manifested and striked on the occasion of last week, the 
 23/24, around the nodal question of Palestine, who then 
 It means the complaint of the complicity of the government in the massacre 
 genocida that is taking place in Palestine and the complaint of a government 
 that, in addition to being an accomplice of Israel, marches towards the war.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The opposition 
 social and political is the one that moves in the jobs, in 
 territories, to claim salary, rights, the defense of health 
 of safety in the workplace in front of the gigantic chain 
 of dead, is the one that rekindles the outbreaks of rebellion in the 
 schools in solidarity with Palestine - which is the reason for 
 latest detective positions - but in general to question the model 
 of school that wants us to impose the fascists in the government and theirs 
 Minister Valditara. And at the same time the movement of women who 
 With great events - and new important ones are announced 
 Initiatives for March 8 - He is putting the general force on the field 
 of women against the policies of this government, 
 within a criticism that certainly goes beyond this government, 
 it concerns "the first" of this government and will also concern "the 
 after ”of this government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is the true 
 social and political opposition. This social and political opposition 
 It should be built and organized in political forms: the party of 
 proletariat of the oppressed, the united front of all those who 
 they fight this government, the state of capital the construction of 
 a force of the masses capable of not allowing the violence of 
 Was the face of the master.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this is 
 helped by contradictions within the bourgeoisie, to the parties of the 
 Parliament and is helped by what happens also in the elections.

    I agree on an analysis that we have done just like MFPR, that is, that this Meloni government has a clear project that carries on and that sees women as one of the centers of the ideological/political attack, women as has already said the companion in introducing this meeting must be for this government even more at the service of capital and are called to have children for capitalist production and war. Clearly in this context we continue to lose ground and continue to lose rights and moreover there is the ideological action in the first place of the government in schools that with Minister Valditara even appeals to the students, therefore in young women, to participate in states General on the birth rate, to marry this campaign at the service of the anti -aborticist associations proved ... the fascism that is in the government is a clear project.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    I share what we have written in this day by talking about a society that produces a modern, more social, more terrible, more institutional and more violent patriarchy and connecting to those that in general are the contents that emerged from the Nudm assembly in Bologna, where in delegation Have we participated, with what should this modern patriarchism fight, through education, through culture or within reforms? It is not the ground that allows us to really change the situation. Certainly there are positive aspects that we cannot absolutely ignore, at the Nudm National Assembly there was a questioning about the role of the family, the patriarchical, the control of immigration, highlighting how this is included in government policy, with The dramatic consequences on our lives, on our working conditions, on the productive and reproductive world, because one must not forget, it was said, that there is also all the consequence of welfare erosion.

</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    So one of the issues that has placed within the assembly is to start from the need to understand all this general context to try to understand how to combine a specific struggle with the strike and how to put together the results obtained on November 25 with Strike of March March, because it was said it is absolutely not a natural outlet.
   </div>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    Having said that, it must be said, however, that the various interventions that have succeeded, in my opinion, were interventions that have been based on individual realities and sometimes even too individualistic and for which they have not possibly given a wide breath, Certainly some intervention has placed a more shareable language and analysis by identifying the responsibilities at an institutional level ... For example, there was the intervention of the companions of Lucha y Siesta who told of the struggle put in the field, which we also followed e that we supported as MFPR, and who managed to obtain not to pay a strong fine and were acquitted of the accusation of employment of the property for profit purposes, however, however, the question of the Lazio Region remains on their head, Which instead wants to somehow clear them and try to remove the building.
   </div>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    But several other interventions have been based a lot on the question of the genre ... for example on the reform of family law and which are rewriting it or on the 164 and the importance of the evolution of this law ... there was the interesting intervention of the node Of the Marche regarding the attack on the right of abortion with the proposal of a national event, the increasingly large space denunciation that the pro -life groups are taking again that are again re -examining on the scene with the obscene and unnecessary propaganda they do.
   </div>
</span>
<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    There were also interventions that were also reported in the work table, on the 2024 bonus that is recognized only to mothers with two children and however with an indeterminate contract, therefore simply smoke in the eyes, together with all the other situations and government decisions against the living condition of women and how to go back ...
   </div>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    Most of the themes, however, which were treated within the assembly were also crossed by the theme of racism in all its forms and by the ability that emerged with the letter that was there on November 25 by Of a partner with handicap, who made a complaint about it ... At the meeting, it was said that the strike is a challenge and a necessary path against violence, against the violence of this government and it is necessary to think about the measures to be taken, the government that It places motherhood as the only dimension of the female.
   </div>
</span>
<span style="color: #080808; font-family: Verdana;  white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    These are issues on which we certainly agree, but in general the interventions is as if they had not had a clear and strong thickness in identifying the responsibilities, in fact, of this fascist government that, as mentioned before, the project there It is clear, while even if within an assembly so important for the number of women and realities that participated, there are no clear indications, it is normal that then you cannot get to those sectors, women, Social to which you want to contact ... For example in the work table where the MFPR partner of Palermo intervened highlighting what are the essentiality and importance of the strike of women as a phase struggle weapon and in perspective compared to the social system To be questioned at 360 degrees and that the strike is not simply any union practice, within this table there has been a lot of debate and the question of the letter or letter is truly repetitive, not as regards the letter regarding the Appeal to the unions and in particular to the CGIL, focus mainly on this type of topics clearly remove strength and weakening what must instead be the strength of March March, which has been tried to underline but has remained as an open field ...

    On the question of Palestine we expressed ourselves with the intervention of one of our partner clearly and precisely of what we think and what it means to be next to the Palestinian women, the resistance of the Palestinian people. What emerged from the various interventions was however a position that is not always clear and with some oppositions ...

     ... the ideological conception of Nudm's background is that of a small bourgeois feminism, we have analyzed it, we have never taken on sectarian attitudes or liquidationists tout court towards a movement that manages to mobilize thousands of women in the square and that to his own Interior is composed of several "souls", but we have always expressed with revolutionary sincerity the criticisms of the positions that in fact for example result in reformism ...

<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
      At the work table we brought our position, even union, on the strike clarifying again that the intent of the strike by the Slai Cobas for the SC, a trade union organization where some of our companions are also delegated, is not at all considered a merely bureaucratic fact or Technical but also the union organization is put at the service of the women's strike, actively working to make the workers protagonists in the strike, which are organized directly in the struggles or that can be reached in the jobs in different forms, a strike that starts from the places of work with all the requests that emerge from the condition that is experienced in them of exploitation, oppression, denial of basic rights, discrimination, repression but by placing the need to expand the view to what is the wider attack and in every area that The majority of the workers, of women suffers as a government, masters, in this social system ... the experiences of struggle of some sectors of workers, workers, precarious that fight or towards which we have made investigation, which in recent years are also have been active in the strike of women, who have striked on a wide platform, from jobs to violence,/feminicides, to the attack of the right of abortion, to war, to internationalist solidarity with oppressed women in the world ... yes it is The importance of the strike of women not as a repetitive or expiration fact but as a renewed weapon of the phase and in perspective in the same to a struggle that must question this capitalist social system to be fought at 360 degrees ...
     </span>
</div>
<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
      ... on the CGIL question it is true that several interventions have focused on this but it seemed that an attitude of criticism and challenge in particular towards the CGIL/Landini that plays on the strike in Iceland has emerged more and then does not indicate the strike for the March 8 ... In general, not to go to the CGIL national meeting, but to support the delegates who want to indirect in the workplace or participate in the strike ...
     </div>
</span>
<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
      Also at this table the need to reason on the result achieved on November 25 and on how to capitalize it to put it to the service of March, in this sense, in this sense, such as connecting to workers in a more concrete way "with a more understandable language ... The workers must be heard in question ... "has been said in an intervention, a concrete proposal that was made is that of a national electronic meeting aimed at the social workers sector, social coops, there were some testimonies in the table of workers on strike these days ...

 We want to consider what is happening on 
 front of the war.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The premier 
 French, Macron, said he is ready to do more and send direct troops and pushes the allies born/he uses to send their troops directly to Ukraine to fight the Russians if Ukraine loses in the clash with 
 Russia - as in fact is happening - because the disaster 
 represented by the Zelensky regime is also reflected in what 
 It is the war conducted by Ukraine, with generals changed like 
 Capricci, with masses, especially young people and people tired of the 
 war and tired of Zelensky's politics that wants weapons, weapons, 
 weapons, as if the contrast between the popular and proletarian masses 
 of Ukraine and Russia had its key in arms and not being 
 Instead the armament that comes from western countries, from states 
 United and from NATO countries. And this is one of the elements that show that this 
 war is not the war of the proletarians and the Ukrainian masses, but it is the 
 War by interposed person of the imperialist powers: Russia 
 which has invaded and, even more, the United States, NATO, countries 
 Europeans who are already participating in this war in all ways. 
 And this, far from being a peace factor has become one 
 unstoppable march towards a general conflict.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This declaration of Macron as well as revealing 
 that this war - the imperialists - want it even more than Ukrainians, is one 
 heavy fuse in the picture of the food of this war that 
 actually it can become officially what it is already 
 in a hidden form, with everything that is connected to the war with it 
 carrying out it as a great carnage of peoples, soldiers, 
 of all the businesses engaged, but also a great factor of profits 
 For the true masters of governments which are the great multinationals, 
 The war industry.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As soon as Macron has 
 Having said that, NATO, Germany and even the United States have 
 Immediately said that no, we don't foresee this. But is not so. Their 
 words are hypocritical. These steps are not made by announcing them on 
 newspapers, evidently.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  NATO, American imperialism, the various European governments, are not ready 
 To take these direct participation steps with soldiers 
 on the territory of Ukraine. Also because they don't have consent 
 internal on this, both that of the polls that tells us how the 
 most of the "public opinions" within these 
 countries, although certainly not agreeing on the Russian invasion 
 of Ukraine, they are certainly not for the war, I'm not for the 
 amazing increase in military expenditure that are overthrown on 
 popular masses.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Macron did not have 
 say this because all the countries are still ready to do it and neither 
 They are united in the real interests to defend in order to do it. 
 However, this highlights what they really want to do.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Macron also said it as part of trying to resume consent in the country 
 and characterize as the only possible government that allows you to 
 realize the imperialist interests of France inside e 
 Outside against the threat represented - threatens in order to 
 Say - from the advance of Le Pen. Therefore to maintain power, for 
 arise as the main servant of the interests of imperialism, 
 Macron does not hesitate to want to drag France into war and to make 
 clear what other countries are already doing, see Italy 
 closely aligned on Ukraine and who intends to do much more 
 on Ukraine also in the context of the current figure of the government 
 Italian and Meloni as president on duty of the G7 to be held 
 In Italy in mid -June.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All of these 
 they want war, all of these want to bring the 
 war. All of these want to transform their countries into countries 
 militarized and war economy and all these do it for the 
 profits and for the interests of the masters. And all this do it in 
 All chessers in the world, from Ukraine to Palestine, to the Middle 
 East, in Asia, where world fires are about to burst 
 even larger dimensions than those already in progress.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This leads us to 
 enhance the importance of manifesting against war and against 
 governments. Solidarity with the Palestinian people, stop the genocide, 
 The ceased the fire must be combined with the relaunch in each country of the struggle 
 against the imperialist war, against the participation of their own 
 governments and their soldiers to wars, against the amazing increase 
 of the war economy and against the internal effects of all this 
 What are more dictatorship, more repression, less democracy.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The workers, the workers, the oppressed, must clear that there is a link between their material condition and what that 
 It happens in the world: what the world prepare for the proletarians, for the popular masses, for the 
 their children, etc.?

  In the most massive way, the thousands of workers, people and youth in Patras were demonstrated. Today's gathering is recorded as one of the most massives in recent years. A year after the crime in Tempi, the people of the city went down the streets, denouncing those who sacrificed the 57 -passengers of the Hellenic Train on the altar of profit.
 </p>
<p>
  Student associations, unions and workers' unions began from the branch area to unite with the rest of the protesters in Olga Square, which were early full. The tractors that had entered the head of the demonstration reminded more of the swan song of the area's rural struggle than its escalation, now that the moods of workers and students are showing a racing direction.
 </p>
<p>
  The following course passed in front of the OSE station where he met strong police forces in front of the building. The protocol for the demonstrators was the attempt to terrorize the police that surrounded the "tail" of the demonstration for much of its journey.
 </p>
<p>
  The class march and the racing moves down two distinct blocks that began with the branch with slogans of complaining of criminal policy imposed on the detriment of the people and the youth.

   The Brazilian newspaper A Nova Democracia has recently reported
  </a>
  on the murder of a peasant, Deyvison Batista da Silva, by the Military Police (MP) in Escada, Pernambuco, on Wednesday 21
  <sup>
   st
  </sup>
  of February. After this, the inhabitants of the area have been blocking for days the national highway BR-101, which is crossing the whole East coast of Brazil.
 </p>
<p>
  The MP murdered the peasant when he was speaking with two friends. Three MP’s went off their motorbikes, including a police thug, known as “Pitbull”, and shot Deyvison in his face. As is usual, the Brazilian repressive forces claimed that Deyvison was armed during the incident, but the people does not believe such tricks, and its shaken by what happened.
 </p>
<p>
  Here the consequences of the blockade can be seen:

  In Berlin, Daniela Klette, who was sought as a member of the Red Army Group
  <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/raf-klette-festnahme-102.html">
   arrested
  </a>
  . Daniela Klette supposedly belongs to the so -called third generation of the RAF and is said to have been on the run since its dissolution in 1998 with two other RAF.
 </p>
<p>
  The public prosecutor announced yesterday that the arrested were Daniela Klette. The 65-year-old has been fleeing since she went underground in the early 1990s. Yesterday she was in an apartment in Berlin Kreuzberg, where she was named, among other things, lived. The said apartment in Kreuzberg is said to have been rented through a third person. In the apartment, the police allegedly found a foreign pass and ammunition, but without the associated weapon. Daniela's neighbors describe them as friendly and tell the journalists of the bourgeois press that they regularly gave mathematics tutoring to children from the neighborhood.
 </p>
<p>
  The German judiciary throws Daniela attempted murder and various tried and completed serious robberies. However, it is all about your activities after the RAF dissolved. Together with the other two subordinated alleged RAF fighters Ernst -Volker Staub and Burkhard Garweg, she is said to have financed her life underground with robberies. Even if the RAF has now dissolved, there is still the possibility that Daniela will also be convicted in addition to the robberies, but also according to paragraph 129 a, “membership in a terrorist association”. Membership in the RAF is actually time -barred, but the upcoming question is whether the judiciary defines or not the attacks committed as activities of the RAF.
 </p>
<p>
  The state has been looking for higher intensity against the three RAF fighters since the beginning of February. Recently there was an episode in the so -called “RAF Trio” in the so -called “RAF Trio” and was appealed to the German subject and the sparkling with a public search for the German Subject. Apparently with an excessive success, because according to the editors of the show, 250 information from spectators received them. A short time afterwards, a major operation by the police in Wuppertal was also triggered, with an uninvolved old man, threatening and arrested by the special units of the police with assault rifles. Previously, the police had a call from someone who thought, in which older passers -by recognized one of the RAF fighters they were looking for. Ultimately, the crucial indication for Daniela's arrest was supposedly also given by a denuncant. However, some time before the program in November 2023. The police did not reveal more information about the given note or the denunciations.
 </p>
<p>
  There are currently numerous attacks through the class justice in the FRG. There are regular demonstration bans and attacks on protests while increasingly larger population groups are demonized and their bourgeois democratic rights are denied. At the same time, there are increased repression against left -wing structures. House searches take place regularly and the rotten German state is increasingly trying to put anti -fascists into jail. In the middle of this situation, the reaction is also increasingly looking for those people who fought the state with the weapon in their hands and have not been found by it since then.
 </p>
<p>
  Now after yesterday's arrest, the German repression authorities are enjoying their success, in the hope of showing strength and intimidating resistance. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser announced in a message from the Ministry of the Interior: "Nobody should feel safe underground." Of course, this does not apply to the round
  <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/rechtsextremismus-bayern-neonazis-untergetaucht-1.5585773">
   600 sought by arrest warrant
  </a>
  Fascists who are submerged.
 </p>
<p>
  Even though Daniela has now been arrested, she managed to avoid the persecution of the repression authorities for over thirty years with her fighting companions.

<a href="https://addisstandard.com/news-ethiopias-amhara-region-sees-renewed-fighting-between-government-forces-fano/">
   have been reported
  </a>
  between militiamen and troops of the Ethiopian Old State in many locations of Amhara, despite that the Ethiopian government informs that the situation is calmed or in “relative peace”. In recent weeks there have been clashes in Gojjam West and North, North Shewa, North Wollo, and in these places the roads have been blocked. Additionally intense battles have been reported in Gondar, Merawi, Dega Damot, Shewa Robit, Antsokiyana Gemza and Lalibela. Also during the last weekend and the first days of this week there have been new and intense clashes. Movement has also been forbidden in some areas of Amhara.
 </p>
<p>
  The Ethiopian State has been trying to solve its problems with the Amharic resistance with intense repression, including the establishment of States of Emergency and carrying out numerous massacres against the people.

  to calm the resistance in Amhara, but strengthen it. Also these ones have even questioned the legality of the Ethiopian State’s measures, such as declaring the States of Emergency or other measures carried out to try to dismantle the Fano militias and the political opposition in general.
 </p>
<p>
  From the beginning of the year several massacres have been known in the Amhara region, perpetrated by the old State. The last one,

   have denounced a new massacre

  , which happened shortly after the beginning of the conflict between the Fano militias and the Ethiopian State. This massacre was committed in the capital of Amhara, Bahir Dar, specifically in the neighborhoods of Abune Hara, Lideta and Saba Tamit, and at least 17 civilians is reported to have been murdered.
 </p>
<p>
  The different associations and journalists who denounce the crimes of the Ethiopian State in Amhara and in other areas of the State, also denounce severe difficulties to report about these events, since the Ethiopian authorities have made numerous prohibitions and limitations of access to communications, especially the access to Internet. These difficulties include numerous detentions and other ways of harassment and repression against them. Regarding this, the media of the imperialist countries have shown their hypocrisy during the last days,

It also has been reported that a year ago another partner of his media was already arrested after the State’s decision to forbid numerous regional media.

</p>
<p>
  On 13th February, 2024, a Special MP/MLA court convicted Liberation leader Manoj Manzil and 22 others in a nine year old murder case of one Jay Prakash Singh and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The state has alleged that Jay Prakash’s killing was in retaliation to the murder of Satish Kumar, a leader of CPIML-Liberation. Satish Kumar was killed on 25th August, 2015, by feudal forces of Badgaon panchayat of Bhojpur for struggling to get the crops of landless and poor peasants purchased by government authorities. This led to him becoming the target of a local feudal element, Rinku Singh, who was also the President of Badgaon Panchayat Primary Agricultural Credit Society (PACS). Four persons, including Rinku Singh and Awdhesh Sah, named in the murder of Satish Kumar were acquitted in 2019, interestingly around the same time when a local court took cognizance of charges against Manoj Manzil and others in Jay Prakash’s killing. The special court while awarding the sentence, stated that the prosecution has not provided “peculiar” evidence to categorize the case as “rarest of rare” and therefore, cannot grant death sentence. But what is more important to understand is that not only the state didn’t provide “peculiar” evidence but they did not provide any material evidence at all and the court relied merely on the 9 witness testimonies, including those of Jay Prakash Singh’s son, investigating officer, medical examiner and few others. The very reason that the judicial system let the killers of Satish Kumar roam free and convicted the leaders of Liberation without ample evidence beyond ‘reasonable doubt’; reeks of conspiracy to suppress democratic dissent of people and all those who stand with them.
 </p>
<p>
  It is important to point out that state has alleged that Jay Prakash was assaulted by Manoj Manzil and others when he was passing by a protest against killing of Satish Kumar. According to this version, the son of Jay Prakash who is also a witness in the case, fled the scene and Jay Prakash went missing, only to be found dead 2 days later, on 27th August 2015. However, there are no sufficient further arguments or material evidence to justify that Manoj Manzil and others were involved in the killing. Furthermore, the role of police and judicial system, in imparting justice in cases of struggle between landless/poor peasantry and feudal forces like Ranveer Sena or Karni Sena (to which killers of Satish Kumar belong to) cannot be ignored. This particular case cannot be evaluated in isolation from the history of massacres like Bathani Tola or Laxmanpur Bathe, carried out by Ranveer Sena that is rising its heads again in the form of Karni and many other private militia of landlords. Whether be it case of murder of Satish Kumar, massacre of 21 landless dalit peasants in Bathani Tola of Bhojpur or massacre of 67 Dalit landless peasants in Laxmanpur Bathe of Jehanabad; the courts from lower to the upper rung have betrayed the oppressed and exploited people by overturning the convictions or delaying justice, ultimately letting the feudal militia roam scot free. However, this very state has been eager to incriminate the leaders and activists working among the oppressed and exploited sections.
 </p>
<p>
  On March 2, 2023, Gaya Sessions Court awarded life sentence to Ram Chandra Yadav, who has already spent 17 years under-trial, for alleged involvement in Killing of 37 Bhumihars (a feudal class- upper caste) by Maoists in February 1992 in retaliation to massacres done by Ranveer Sena. In this case also, a person, who already spent 17 years In jail, was sentenced to life in TADA case, whereas in massacres by Ranveer Sena, let alone TADA, not even normal penalty under relevant sections of IPC has been awarded. We see the conviction of Manoj Manzil and 22 others in this similar pattern and believe that the protector of Ranveer Sena, Nitish Kumar along with Brahmanical Hindutva Fascist BJP-RSS is unleashing this onslaught on leaders of Liberation to suppress any voice of democratic dissent against rising feudal, casteist and communal violence in the country. This attack should not be seen as an isolated one, but a well coordinated attack on the very idea of struggle against oppression. Therefore, all the forces that strive to struggle for a democratic society, free from exploitation and oppression, must perceive this attack as one on their own and fight it back unitedly.
 </p>
<p>
  Campaign Against State Repression strongly condemns the frivolous framing and conviction of Comrade Manoj Manzil and 22 others in Badgaon murder conspiracy case and demands their immediate unconditional release. We also call upon all democratic, progressive and justice-loving people to unite and fight back such offensive against the Democratic forces.

   With 
 the massive presence of youth, students, students, young workers and 
 farmers as well as workers from local authorities, teachers and others by 
 Private and Public Sector The Strike rally in 
 Volos. The gathering took place at Liberty Square where they called the Labor 
 Center and the Prefectural Department of ADEDY, PAME Associations, Students 
 Associations, Labor Forces, including the class course and others 
 local agents.

  THE 
 Separate concentration held by the anarchy area and the club 
 Employees and youth was necessarily led to the central course.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  The 
 Slogans of the course mainly focused on the crime in Tempi and less 
 in the necessary labor -populist claims. A special feature is 
 perseverance of some forces (SEK - ARAS) to focus on their pace 
 Only in Mitsotakis and the ND government leaving the rest of us 
 Representatives of the bourgeois political system (SYRIZA - PASOK et al.)
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  THE 
 Class course in common block and banners with racing moves participated 
 in gathering and course with slogans and massive sharing of the notice 
 .
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;">
  THE 
 Massive participation of workers and youth in the strike rally 
 reveals that the rift between the people and the system grows and the 
 Student and farmers' struggles, despite the obstacles and 'triceps', have 
 It contributes significantly to it. Is an important legacy for the working -labor 
 Forces who want on the road, in workplaces, in schools and 
 schools to organize their resistance and claims.

   We publish this unofficial translation of
   <a href="https://fdlp-ec.blogspot.com/2024/02/no-la-consulta-popular.html">
    a statement
   </a>
   of the Front of Defense of the Struggles of the People – Ecuador.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The government is preparing to hold a referendum that, if approved, will definitely submerge the masses, the workers from the countryside and from the city in a condition of labor exploitation more wretched than the existing one.
 </p>
<p>
  Noboa invented an internal war to justify handing over the country to Yankee imperialism. In order to be able to specify it, in addition to the ” internal conflict” he had to declare a state of emergency that has been prolonged by 30 more days; In this way, together with the Armed Forces, they have created an environment of unrestricted “necessity” for the intervention of the state repressive apparatus with the purpose of maintaining “order and peace.” What has he achieved with this? Capture of nearly 10,000 citizens, some linked to criminal gangs, the majority, residents of poor neighborhoods, (false positives), intimidating the leaders of the people’s organizations; limit the acts from the Assembly and from certain elements of opposition to the regime from the bureaucratic scene, and delivering, on a silver platter, the structure and planning of everything concerning the Armed Forces, police and external/internal security of the country, to imperialism.
 </p>
<p>
  But it’s all a hoax. There is no work, there are no resources to pay wages, there is poor health care; not because of crime, corruption. Military and police are involved with the gangs; there is an increase in VAT, and, definitely, a speculative cascade is coming to us exposed in the dramatic increase in the cost of the basic food basket.
 </p>
<p>
  Thousands of Ecuadorians “escape” from the economic crisis to other countries, no longer is it a simple emigration, it is an exodus that determines: live, or die, since many compatriots have fallen prey to crime on the way to the USA. Incredibly, like the banking crisis at the end of the century In the past, income from remittances has become one of the three main “contributions” that feed the country’s GDP.
 </p>
<p>
  What does the referendum point to? Mainly, to strengthen the repressive, punitive and tendency to imprison response from the government. Give more power than it already has to the Armed Forces. To intend to legalize capital from drug trafficking and organized crime. But, actually the three billion dollars that enter to the financial circulation of the country as a result of drug trafficking, above all, the banks, are not already regularized?
 </p>
<p>
  The consultation promotes openness to foreign investment, but is not subject of national laws, but of “international arbitration” in case of controversies. The ultimate conditions of the so-called “foreign investment” are delivered to international legislation that responds to the interests of the large monopolies, financial centers and imperialist property.
 </p>
<p>
  Insisting on extradition. They have created a “false environment” in this regard. One more hoax, a criminal, to be extradited, must have committed a crime that directly affects another country. It is obvious that the direction there is basically political. They vaccinate imperialism in the country against potential reactions against its armed presence in national territory. They are also going for tougher penalties. Another stupidity, a criminal, including “white collar” ones, never commits a crime thinking about losing, about not being successful, then the penalties don’t matter.
 </p>
<p>
  Finally, reform the labor code. They want to favor businessmen and employers. Stupid. To hell with the labor conquests that have been wrested from the ruling classes and the old State through struggle; many of them, through the death, mutilation, imprisonment, torture of hundreds of workers who generously gave their lives to materialize those achievements and defend their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  In short? An unnecessary, punitive, imprisoning, capitulationist referendum, which does not subscribe to anything related to issues of a social nature such as: education, health, social security, etc.
 </p>
<p>
  And in the middle of this, Noboa states; “Possibly, I will run for re-election.” But he is not alone, in the queue, the last electoralist is followed by Granja, Rabascal, Gonzales and, without surprising us at all, Leónidas Iza.
 </p>
<p>
  The referendum is coming. DO NOT VOTE, DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN IT. It is not enough to say, “all NO in the referendum” as revisionism has begun to point out, which are the same people who say “52% of the electoral population is to blame for what we experienced, because they voted for Noboa.” No, they are still tied to the elections, they continue to think that this is the way to solve the problems of the masses, of the poor peasants.
 </p>
<p>
  We must unmask opportunism, revisionism, the ones towards elections, those who insist and persist on the bureaucratic path. We must fight them at all possible levels. DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE REFERENDUM, BOYCOTT IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. THAT IS THE SLOGAN OF THE PEOPLE.

  Athens was flooded. Thousands of strikers and young people took to the streets demonstrating their anger against the barbaric, murderous, anti -populist and anti -labor policy. And this, despite the absence of a strike from the GSEE workers (who continue the subversive for their labor movement), but also against the forces of consensus and submission to "get out of the obligation" and preach and preach it. the end of the matches.
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  It was clear that the rage over the daily and escalating anti-labor and anti-populist attack is overflowing: the demolition of rights, the unprecedented precision, the attack on the future of the youth itself, in the crusader measures for farmers.
 </p>
<p>
  Especially when he coincided with the one-year completion of the massive state-of-state murder in Tempi, and the obvious operation of the concealment of the responsibilities of this rotten system and its managers. It was clear from the previous days that this would give even greater boost to the struggles expressed on the streets for weeks by students and farmers, and despite the rush of farmers to close (just a day earlier!) The agricultural mobilizations. And it was also clear that this mass "meeting" of these moods on the street did not fit into the character of the memorial that the forces of submission wanted to mobilize. Nor should it be disoriented behind the alleged "clarification" operation of the causes and those responsible through examinations and other state committees and bodies. Because the people are well aware that the key responsible for this crime is the bourgeois state itself and the policy of its governments. Policy that exploits, oppresses and murders!
 </p>
<p>
  Very massively, with the pulse of the classrooms and racing movements, the racing movements of teachers and the student resistance, promoting slogans of claiming labor rights, defending strikes and class union, defense of your youth struggles, but also solidarity with the fighting Palestinian people. There were a few times that these two composed blocks were applauded from the surrounding world.
 </p>
<p>
  The presence of the repressive forces, especially around the blocks that gathered in Havtia is very intense. Indeed, shortly before the end of the demonstration, they were attacking the concentrated and casting chemicals, which they did a little earlier without achieving the dissolution of the demonstration.
 </p>
<p>
  Today's strike rally can and should be boosted to the further establishment of the popular and labor movement, to continue the struggles of people and youth. The fact that government provocation continues with the submission of the bill on private universities shows that there is no room for repetition.

   reports
  </a>
  that US and Norwegian imperialism have made an agreement allowing several new US military bases in Norway.
 </p>
<p>
  The Supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement (SDCA) was signed on the 2
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of February by the Norwegian Minister of Defense, Bjørn Arild Gram, and the US Ambassador to Norway, Marc Nathanson. The agreement will have to be approved by the parliament before it can take into effect, and might require a three fourth majority to be passed. This majority has already been achieved as the parties representing the large majority of the parliament have voiced their support for the agreement.
 </p>
<p>
  While the Norwegian Governments have had a line against military bases of other countries in Norway since 1949, several so called “united areas” have been created in the last years. These areas are mainly used by the US, which can build out its military infrastructure there, but other NATO members can also use it for military purposes.
 </p>
<p>
  The SDCA agreement is an extension of a defense agreement between the US and Norway, that was approved by the Norwegian parliament in June of 2022. As part of the agreement the US currently has four unified areas in military bases in Norway. The new agreement proposes the creation of eight new areas. The majority of the existing and proposed unified areas are in military airports.
 </p>
<p>
  Similar agreements have also been made between the other Nordic imperialists counties and US imperialism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland signed bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCAs) with the US in December of 2023. The agreements, which have not yet taken into effect, proposes the creation of 17 unified areas in Sweden, 15 in Finland and 3 in Denmark.

    Which is in prison for a very right protest, a demonstration that was there last year against a truly illegal Nazi gathering, framing, shameful. This gathering has also been repeated this year, even if in a less striking form, and this is to be attributed only and only a greater mobilization of the anti -fascists, both from other and Hungarian countries, benefits, women ... we are fully with Ilaria Salis when he says I am innocent, but for us the problem is that it is very right to attack, protest, fight against these neonazians who are truly a black wave, a cancer, which in Hungary have the maximum accessibility, the maximum support from the government, but unfortunately, As we are seeing, it also happens here by us, see the demonstration of more than 200 fascists who have been in the academy in which nothing was really done against if not some denunciations to individuals when many were instead, therefore maximum support At the battle that Ilaria Salis is doing, who is doing her father, we continue to talk about it, we continue to report them, we continue to bring it to our initiatives because together with Ilaria we have to win on this, because it is a victory not only against the Orban government, but A victory also against the best friend of the Orban government against Meloni.

We have reached the point, as companions of Naples, of the Si Cobas, who is the police headquarters that says what you can write in the signs and what you cannot write, what you can say with the slogans and what you cannot say, in short If this is not a dictatorship, if it is not modern fascism what is it? And there have been companions like Mimì of Naples that we know very well of the Si Cobas who have had a split head, we have already sent solidarity but it is good that from this meeting you send a collective solidarity because we will continue more and more to manifest to the side of the Palestinian people and Palestinian women. And there are deadlines already in next week. In this sense, we remind you that at national level, and also internationally, two days have been called alongside the Palestinian people against the genocidal state of Israel, against the massacrer Netanyahu, for 23 and 24, the 23 most aimed at workers, at factories, at the jobs, on the 24th there is a national demonstration in which it would be useful not only to participate, but also make visible in the complaint of the massacres, the killings of the women who are taking place in Palestine, there are already almost 30,000 massacres of which Most are women, children, the resistance, the strength of women who, as we have said, transform their tears, their immense pain into force, fight ... we would like to launch an appeal because on 24 there is the national demonstration a Milan, because Milan as the Palestinians themselves say is Palestinian, from 7 October in Milan all the Saturdays have been the events and it is a continuous beacon, on that continues to shine just to keep high support for the resistance of the Palestinian people, solidarity And the complaint and fight against our government. Here too Meloni was one of the first ones who went after October 7 to tighten the sausage of Netanyahu. In Milan beautiful events in which women, the Palestinian girls, are the soul, they are the heart, they are the most combative. I participated in one of these manifestations and really fills your heart. So also in L'Aquila, today a partner from L'Aquila is connected, where there have been various events for Palestine.

     A national event in defense of the right of abortion was said to the Nudm assembly, s
    </b>
    Econdo we are very right and more appropriate, in the face of the things that have already been said, which have been reported. And it would be the case here, this could be our proposal, that this event coincided with the day or the days when the general states will be made on the birth rate. Or three or two years ago there were general states in Verona and there was a great manifestation of women on that occasion, here. If we unite, as it would be right, not only the event that claims your hands from the right to death, but also that fights. Those who today, government, various ministers, all the scum, want to attack this right of abortion, to the question of the general states on the birth rate would be good ... but we think of the whole issue of conscientious objection that unfortunately is also in the existing law .

<b>
     On March 8 it is clear that in our opinion the two themes but also the two realities that must be central in March 8, are first of all the workers, the workers
    </b>
    that, as has been said, in an indomitable way, with all the attacks, the suffering, the threats, the blackmail of being first fired, of no longer having more work, with the contracts that are changed, made ultra precarious, not to speak Discrimination, up to sexual harassment, attitudes from the garments ... but they fight, they certainly do not stop with 1000 difficulties, fear but continue to fight. Clearly March 8 is not a strike, as a trade union, trade union strikes are almost every day, from the South to the North, in every workplace, from the factories, which are now the great factories, the target of the attack in place of work and salary and women no longer do it and in many jobs, also services, cooperatives, etc. Here, these struggles are necessarily made and do not wait for the dates but March 8 is something more for the same workers, for the same workers who take in their hands the fact that all life must change ... it is not that The workers think of daily working, wage, working conditions, how to say, the bourgeois feminists think about sexual violence, the problem of the right to abortion ... because these things, sexual violence for example touches more and more often Proletarian women, women who, as Antonietta said before, don't even have the possibility sometimes to be economically independent and therefore must undergo and be offended when they say enough, when they break the ties, then it becomes almost natural, it is becoming something in which the The only comparison could be with the killings that take place in the United States, one goes to a school and shoots and kills, so it seems that it is normal that as soon as the man is frustrated, his companion, the ex -boyfriend, feels abandoned, frustrated In his man prosopope he kills the woman who abandoned him…. The fact of Latina is emblematic, those who shot was a marshal of the Guardia di Finanza, but in 2014 there were other killings in this country, a country with less than 40,000 people, made by a carabiniere and a prison police officer. That is, it means that there is a logic, there is a humus, a climate that pushes, which shows as natural that to a certain if you leave me, if you want to make choices that are independent of me, male, me or I kill you, I can kill you.
   </div>
</span>
<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    In this sense, the problem is that now you have to be more precise.
    <b>
     It is fascism that is causing a modern patriarchism, that is, it is no longer the old patriarchism
    </b>
    which at most was consumed only in the four walls of houses where women were submissive. Now there is a fascism, a modern paternalism that reacts in the face of the fact that women want to be able to make choices, they don't want to be subordinated, they want to break the ties, and therefore there is this reaction. A modern patriarchism, as a writer said, is a modern, non -medieval man, the one who kills today. This places the fact that women want to break relationships, women want to have the opportunity to decide their lives and. This is an important element to unleash the struggle of women.
   </div>

<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
     On 8 March the workers who struggle continuously, the workers who are now brutally sent home or their existence are worsened on the jobs, the women of the poorest neighborhoods, who if not them have to take a struggle that clearly has At the base the material conditions, the economic conditions, the conditions, but which must invest the whole condition of women ...
    </b>
    For example also on abortion, if it is removed, as it has been in the past, some go abroad to abort but who can go? Many women, workers, precarious, unemployed, migrants, young people cannot pay the doctor's conscientious doctor in hospitals but a golden spoon in the private study. .
    <b>
     So here we make a specific appeal to workers to workers, to proletarian women to be more daring, more proud, more determined on everything, to bring the determination you have at work, on the struggles in every area because this life, all life must change.
    </b>
    I am reading a book called Vincenzina, now he knows it talks about a worker of the Etalsider of Bagnoli, when he speaks of the wage differences he says about 20% less than the salary than the men "retain our dignity in the paycheck" in the paycheck " That is, it is not just a problem of money, it is a problem that towards women retain our dignity. It is normal that there are salary differences, it is normal for women to have the worst contracts, it is normal that therefore there is an extra load by the owners, by the government, etc.? Well, we must put this extra load against the government too, the owners ... on the question of the government is true has a precise plan, what he wanted to do with decree, but a moment we have seen that he is also fragile, It was enough on the great November 25, that there was the attack on the door of Provity, that there were signs, support slogans to Palestinian women, it was enough that there were slogans, signs such as those brought by us against us against the Meloni government, we were a small group, shouted to terrorist feminism, a partner was also attacked only because he brought the Palestinian flag. This government is strong but it is also fragile for internal issues, one disagrees with the other, Meloni disagrees with Salvini, they make the shoes each, there is no real opposition ... but if we us Women do this opposition then we see that a sign on Palestine is enough to cause screams and criminalization ...

<b>
     On March 8th we would like to take a sort of march to the factories between the workers, in the realities of workers in struggle, but the other important and central question today is Palestine,
    </b>
    bring with a contingent on March 8 to the Palestine question, in the possible event, the message of the revolutionary struggle of the necessary women ... this is our flag, the contribution we want to give ... the need must emerge strong in this March 8 To say dangerous then perhaps all this strength by the government, of the state can be inclined, clearly to overturn it it takes something more.

   More than 50 organizations formed the organizing commission of the act that, since January, worked hard to leave successfully and massively. In the midst of new femicides, such as those of Camila in Florencio Varela and María Luisa in Berazategui. Meetings and awareness activities were held during these months.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   On Monday 19, cutting H. Yrigoyen Avenue in front of the Quilmes station, thousands of women participated in the event "For Natalia and for all" under the slogan "Boards in the streets facing the adjustment and delivery policy of Milei. To defend our conquests and fight for what we lack. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   Numerous leaders of political, union and social spaces of the region participated in the act, such as Liliana Méndez, a member of the Central Committee of the PCR and secretary of the Quilmes, Berazategui and F. Varela area; Cristina Cabib, president of the Tribute Commission to the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo de Quilmes; Patricia Paredes, of the South Women's Space; Councilors of Union for the homeland of Quilmes headed by the president of the block, Eva Mieri; Bárbara Cocimano, Secretary of Women, Diversities and Human Rights of Quilmes; among other.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   Hundreds of accessions from all over the country reached the event, highlighting the greeting of Mayra Mayra Mendoza, who affirmed "we have to remember it in the midst of a political and socio -economic context that we would never have wanted, with the most reactionary right conducting the destiny of the country" And he highlighted “we have started the way to comply with the emergency in violence against women and diversities, declared in Quilmes in 2018 and extended twice, product of you, companions. Of our struggle ”. And he closed his greeting pointing out “This fight does not end, and as every year, he finds us more together than ever. By Natalia, for his family, for all. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   At the beginning of the act of Lidia Braceras, historical leader of Suteba Quilmes and the Blue and White Teaching Group, together with Fabiana Pérez Valdez (current secretary of Suteba Quilmes) and Debora Procaccini (General Secretary General Previously), made a semblance of Natalia. He highlighted his role as a delegate of his school, EP 87 of La Matera, his companionship and his warmth.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   Then, the Organizing Commission of the Act took the stage and, in its name, Yanel Mogaburo -Dirigent of the Women's Commission of Quilmes, Berazategui, Varela- read the consensual document. There, the history of women's and diversities movement of the region is traveled, which conquered the emergency in violence against women in 2018.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   The document also denounces the current situation: “Today more than ever we reaffirm the path of unity and struggle to face those who intend to snatch the rights. On December 10, the government of Milei-Villarruel assumed, and it was undoubted violently. With Milei, the representatives of reactionary and fascist sectors who publicly claim the Videla dictatorship, renie from Malvinas, and reject the rights conquered by this people, arrived. Sentepatria sectors that deliver our wealth, our resources and our sovereignty for crumbs. Milei is no novelty, it is not the new. Milei, Villarruel, Macri, Bullrich, Caputo and Company, are the worst of our past, are the ones that project a country for a few, hungry and repression for the majority, a government to the extent of the International Monetary Fund, the same as the same as In the Macri government, billions of dollars escaped and borrowed for 100 years. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   The document also denounces the growth of violence against women, referring to the recent cases of femicide that shocked the area, two young women of F. Varela and Berazategui, Camila and María Luisa. For them, we demand justice.
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   After the demands that the women's movement maintains, the document concludes “by Natalia and for all, let's build the roads that allow us to transform anger and pain in struggle, in defense of what we have and for everything we lack. We are convinced that fascists, anti rights and vendatria will be defeated with the unity of the people. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal" style="page-break-after: avoid;">
   After the event, a large march was held that toured the streets of the center of Quilmes, towards San Martín Square. With songs, banners and the sympathy of the neighbors, once again, the emergency in violence that advances in eradicating the violence that women and diversities suffer daily was required. Between applause, hugs and cries of emotion, the march concluded in the amphitheater of the Plaza San Martín and the call for a great day on March 8 for International Working Women's Day.

<p>
   At 89, our beloved partner Jorge Risi died. Roque, as we all knew him, joined our party since its foundation, having been in the FJC with which he broke along with thousands of young people.
  </p>
<p>
   He played in different organization tasks, in the dictatorship he did it as responsible for the press task, and in recent years as responsible for the National Sports Commission.
  </p>
<p>
   Roque was a true communist who fought his whole life to realize the historical objective of the working class, society without exploiters or exploited.
  </p>
<p>
   We say goodbye on Wednesday, February 21, at the Chacarita cemetery. With the presence of his son Andrés, family, friends and comrades we give him a fair and deserved tribute.
  </p>
<p>
   Comrade Sebastián Ramírez, friend of Roque, recalled some passages of his life and militant work. "Bonaerense de Pehuajó proud, he met an old field doctor, Dr. Rocha, and was a friend of his son Jorge", who was secretary of organization of our party.
  </p>
<p>
   Ramírez remembered his passion for sport, both in basketball and in football, as well as some of his tasks: “He generated countless friends, despite a turbulent, devilish character. The man was difficult. Friend of Otto Vargas, friend of the Clan Stivel. Things that perhaps at the time we would not have told, so many years spent that we can bleach some of their relationships and some of his tasks such as the link with personalities such as Federico Luppi, Carlos Carella, Marilina Ross. Their poachers in the middle of lead in the cars in motion while exchanging their "figurines" and arguing politics being that they were their friends. Friend of David Viñas ”.
  </p>
<p>
   Ariel Oliveri remembered, son of Nestor, the remembered "Chinese Doctor", on his Facebook page: "Roque militated his whole life and never had a handle. He never had a car. He died in a two -room department that he rented by two mangoes with his retirement. It was one of those guys who do not get into politics to save themselves. He fought all his life to leave a more fair world ...
  </p>
<p>
   “He was one of the creators and ideologues of Buenos Aires youth tournaments. He told me the whole process and worked with him for many years. He gave me a huge hand. The discussion he put was how many games the kid or the neighborhood piba played that did not come to go around. If there were less than four, it was not a social sport. Always thinking about the massive. ”
  </p>
<p>
   And Ramírez culminated, in the tribute: “Roque lived with absolute fidelity to his ideas, leaves a million friends and a toothbrush. A frugal, austere man.
  </p>
<p>
   “Dear companion Jorge Risi, dear Roque until victory always! Overcome".

   On February 23, 1983, the first issue of our newspaper took to the street
   <strong>

   , under the Maoist motto of serving the people. We continued the task carried out by

   From the foundation of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Argentina, in January 1968, as a dissemination body of the central committee of the party.

   It came out regularly for 15 years very difficult, most of them under two military dictatorships, in which it had to be printed and distributed in hiding. In the times when he murdered and tortured dozens of companions per day,
   <em>
    New hour
   </em>
   He arrived biweekly to all corners of the country. This was possible because of the effort of hundreds of comrades throughout the country, which contributed in this way to the struggles of the people against the dictatorship and to keep alive the flame of revolutionary communism in our country. Three hundred ninety -three editions of
   <em>
    New hour
   </em>
   They are testimony of it.
  </p>
<p>
   After the Malvinas War, in 1982 the workers and popular struggles were deepened, which put the military dictatorship in check, already with Bignone as president. The dictatorship was able to negotiate its withdrawal with the directions of the main political parties, and thus we reached a conditioned "democratic openness", in which the disqualifications and political proscriptions were maintained to the left and popular organizations such as our PCR.
  </p>
<p>
   In this framework of limited legality conquered by the popular struggle, with our still proscript party and our beloved first secretary, Otto Vargas, prosecuted, even in the early days of the Alfonsinist government, the central committee decided to adopt the new name of
   <strong>
<em>
     hoy
    </em>
</strong>
   For the newspaper, which would be legally edited, reaffirming our revolutionary ideals and objectives.
  </p>
<p>
   Our newspaper, which first appeared biweekly and as of 1985 as a weekly, had as director since its inception Eugenio Gastiazoro, who died on November 27, 2022. Eugenio, a member of the central committee of our party, had previously directed
   <em>
    New hour
   </em>
   Since 1974.
  </p>
<p>
   With this edition, we fulfilled 2000 fighting to keep us faithful to our motto, and putting our pages at the service of the struggles of the exploited and oppressed masses against the oligarchs and the imperialists and the policies at their service, always with the aim of moving towards the National and Social Liberation Revolution.
  </p>
<p>
   In these 2000 editions, with the guide of the central committee of our party we have crossed very diverse situations in national and international politics, and we believe we have contributed in part to the development of the workers and popular struggles, holding the flags of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism .
  </p>
<p>
   More than 40 years of our first issue, and crossing the second decade of the 21st century, with all the changes in communication that have been developed, particularly with the development of the Internet and social networks, we reaffirm that the newspaper, the main one PCR organization and propaganda political instrument, remains key in the political unification of the party, an “organizer” instrument - as Lenin said - in its construction and that of the revolutionary class and communist current, in addition to a thermometer of our relationship With the masses.
  </p>
<p>
   We understand our newspaper as an integral part of the revolutionary communication of our party, together with the website, its social networks, the theoretical magazine

   On 21/2, in Monte Chingolo, we tribute Otto Vargas, first general secretary of the PCR, five years after his death. He welcomed us the president of the club that lent the facilities and began singing the national anthem. Comrades and friends: unemployed, retired, teachers, workers and young people we listen carefully to the speakers.

   Companion Pablo, from the JCR, said: “Today in the JCR we have several challenges, one is to transform that young vote that voted punishing the situation that lives and voted to Milei, transforming it by rebellion so that this youth is organized and taken in its Hands fight for your needs. As with those who study, who cut the budget in education, or those who work twelve hours for a miserable salary and we do not know if they will renew the contract. ”
  </p>
<p>
   Juana, a member of the Zonal Committee and Central Committee of the party, said: “Jacinto Roldán, current general secretary, said that this party maintains the same objectives since its foundation, fighting because the working class and the people take in their hands the fight for The revolution of the set to guarantee ceiling, work, health and education for all.
  </p>
<p>
   “That Milei won the ballot was a hard blow to the entire popular, national and democratic movement, and it was also strong for the game, because we are part of that movement ... sectors had been dragging anger and anger with Alberto Fernandez, Cristina Kirchner, with Massa ... Alberto Fernandez's policy did not solve popular emergencies, paid the external debt and aggravated the situation of millions, that discussion was taken advantage of by the reactionary right and presented Milei as who was going to produce the change.
  </p>
<p>
   “The line of the party was fair to lead the struggles for the needs and campaign for union for the country, fighting the unity of the front and playing with everything with our ten measures.
  </p>
<p>
   “They came to change the paradigm of Argentina, what we are: democratic, health defenders, public education, destroy regional economies, culture, rights conquered by women, are working for an Argentina for 20 million ... But they face a town that is not meek, a town that has a struggle.
  </p>
<p>
   "The town on the streets set aside the protocol ... it will be decisive that we continue to fight on the street ... we have to correct to live up to the times, we have to move forward, discuss and ask ourselves questions and correct our practice, here in The southern zone, what do we direct? Where do we have groups? Do we work in the concentration centers seriously or do we occasionally? Do they direct cells or people? Are the reports discussed by all comrades? ... How many of us are, how many newspapers we place, and how many we pay? ... the broadest unit is necessary with all sectors and the growth and strengthening of our party is also crucial. ”
  </p>
<p>
   At the close of the act, Mariano Sanchez, secretary of the Zonal Committee and a member of the Central Committee made a tour from the beginning of the PCR to the present and on the role of Otto Vargas in the construction of the party, pointing to the need to prepare for the times that come.

Only in this way will it have the ability to adapt immediately to the most varied and quickly changing struggle conditions. The revolution itself should not be imagined as a unique act. We must develop our activity in any situation, a work of unified political agitation throughout the country that helps spread our proposals, to fight in the three planes- economic, political and ideological- and that is directed to the great masses. And that work is inconceivable without a newspaper like ours.

   For millions of Kurds and Kurdish, Abdullah Öcalan is considered its political leader, even though it has been in a Turkish jail. As Nelson Mandela, he is considered key to a fair future for his people. His ideas promote radical democracy, women's rights and multiethnic coexistence, and are the inspiration of the democratic autonomous administration of the North and East of Syria (AADNES).
  </p>
<p>
   At present, there is an international campaign for its freedom, but the report summarized below is simply focused on its detention conditions. Against national and international legislation, it is in almost total isolation. The contact with his family and his lawyers has always been restricted, and for almost three years, in a regime of absolute lack of communication, without any contact with the outside world.
  </p>
<p>
   In Report 2023, the law firm and lawyers defending the Kurdish leader and other prisoners İmralı, denounced that Öcalan has been held in a lonely cell in the island's prison since February 15, 1999. During the first ten years He was the only prisoner there. Six other prisoners were transferred in 2009, but he continued in insulation regime 23 hours a day during the week and 24 hours on weekends. At present, there are three other prisoners on the island, in addition to Öcalan. These three men have been there since 2015 and are equally isolated.
  </p>
<p>
   During the first twelve years, the right of Öcalan to see a lawyer was limited -ilegally- in one hour a week, but the authorities prevented him from exercising even this limited right, claiming problems with the weather or the state of the ship that communicates the island. Since July 2011, he has only been able to meet with his lawyers five times, all between May and August 2019, after a mass hunger strike demanding his release. Since 2014, only five family visits have been allowed. The last face to face was with his brother, in March 2020. In almost 15 years he has only allowed two telephone calls; The last one, in March 2021, was interrupted shortly after starting. Nothing is known about Öcalan since that day.
  </p>
<p>
   The UN Human Rights Committee asked Turkey in September 2022 to allow prisoners without restrictions on a lawyer of their election, but this has not had an effect, despite the renewal of this petition in January 2023 .
  </p>
<p>
   There have been numerous requests before the Turkish Constitutional Court in relation to these illegal conditions, and the lawyers have also filed complaints before the Union of Bar Associations of Turkey and the Superior Council of Judges and Prosecutors, all of them without result.
  </p>
<p>
   The European Committee for Torture Prevention (CPT) has constantly criticized prison conditions, but without result. Recognizing that the CPT cannot issue the report on your September 2022, without the consent of Turkey, lawyers have asked them to invoke article 10/2 and make a statement regarding the conditions in İMrald.
  </p>
<p>
   In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that the life imprisonment without probation of Mr. Öcalan was torture by denying the right to hope. The Committee of Ministers did not give course to this judgment until 2021. The committee commissioned Turkey to guarantee the existence of a mechanism for reviewing convictions and that he informed him of the number of other prisoners convicted of non -revisable life imprisonment. Turkey has not acted in both cases, and the Committee has ignored the requests of what follow -up.
  </p>
<p>
   The denial of legally guaranteed rights in İMralı has been parallel to the refusal to act in the question of the rights of the Kurds within Turkey, where the dialogue has been rejected in favor of invulnerability.

   We appreciate the broad solidarity received for the partner from unions, organizations and personalities committed to the human rights of Córdoba.
  </p>
<p>
   On 19/2 in hours at noon, the teacher of the blue and white and councilor of Agua de Oro, Cecilia Panzetta, was violently threatened in the collective when he was heading to Río Ceballos.
  </p>
<p>
   As a teacher, he has headed the implementation of the ESI, and on previous occasions he has been defamed by the networks and personally attacked. As a councilor, he has been part of those who headed the rejection of the Bus Law and the DNU.
  </p>
<p>
   While the reactionary sectors and the president himself believe they are enabled to intimidate and threaten, characters like this man embargo. In a cowardly act he said: "I know where you live," "I'm going to burn you," "I know that you are a teacher in the village and have problems for indoctrinator," "I am liberal libertarian to the core and even death." Everything that happened is included in the judicial complaint based immediately.
  </p>
<p>
   Made the complaint, the UEPC teaching guild and other Ctera base guilds, Teaching Groups of Córdoba, the United Agua de Oro Front, the national deputy Gabriela Estévez, Hilda Bustos Secretary of the CGT, the provincial legislators Federico Alessandri and Luciana Presas and companions of the PSOL, Popular Unit and other UXP parties, members of local governments of the Chicas Sierras Corridor, collective of local women and other allies and sectors have sent their solidarity, expressing repudiation to antidemocratic actions.
  </p>
<p>
   Enough of harassment, persecution and intimidation to those who face Milei's anti -democratic adjustment and policy.

   There were acts and marches in several provinces, coinciding with the beginning of the classes, in which ATE workers converged, also in the day of struggle, and the historical CONADU (university teachers), which also called unemployment.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>

<strong>
    CABA
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   In CABA, the teachers of that district and Greater Buenos Aires, under a persistent rain, concentrated in front of the Pizzurno Palace, headquarters of the current Ministry of Education.
  </p>
<p>
   An act was held in which education and state workers spoke, where the head of CTERA raised the call to a national educational march.
  </p>
<p>
   There we talked to the companion Myriam Marinozzi, general secretary of Suteba Berazategui: “We are mobilized because since its assumption, this government has done nothing but destroy everything that depends on the State, with hate, viciousness and great cynicism and mainly everything that It has to do with health and education. On that path, paranate and disregard education by stating that ‘schools are from the provinces’. This is at least to deny our National Constitution, which in its articles 14 and 14 bis speak of the indeligible responsibility of the national State, regarding the right to education. They have definanced part of our salary, such as the plus that give us connectivity, cutting the Fonid, teaching incentive and what is even more serious, the money of the dining rooms, of connecting equality, of the improvement plan, corresponding to the technical schools and infrastructure".
  </p>
<p>
   And Marinozzi added: “Given the severity of the situation, companions and colleagues, we have summoned ourselves from much of the schools, of all the branches, regardless of the groups, because this has to find us together, and especially very close with community. We have come dozens of partners by train, in subway and walking, very happy to meet in unity to face this hunger and delivery policy. ”

   After the round that surrounded the Plaza San Martín, the traditional closing act was held on the side of the monument that pays tribute to the mothers, they continue to march. The act began reading the greeting of comrade Liliana Méndez, member of the central committee of our party and secretary of the Zonal Quilmes - Berazategui - Varela. Then a tribute was made to Flora, who helped the construction of the mothers of Plaza de Mayo de Quilmes at the time of the dictatorship and recently died. With the presence of his daughter Paula and his grandson, the words written by his son were read, who tells his story as an immigrant woman and a strong fighter for human rights, having accompanied families to look for their sons and daughters stopped disappeared by the dictatorship of 1976. Its story is in the book
   <em>
    Looks
   </em>
   , by Ana Flores, who was also honored in the spot, when a new anniversary of his death was fulfilled.
  </p>
<p>
   Then the companion Emilia took the floor for the CCC, after the extraordinary national day of struggle. He raised the food emergency claim, under the slogan "our empty pots." And the issue of school kit, since "like pots, backpacks are also empty." Then, Patricia Iribarne gave a greeting from the Organization May 25. Then, a document prepared by the “Multisectoral of Quilmes for the work, production and national sovereignty” was read, in repudiation of the visit of the Foreign Minister of Great Britain, David Cameron, to our Falkland Islands.
  </p>
<p>
   Milagros, companion of the CCC, took the floor to count on the act carried out on Monday 19/2 to 12 years of the femicide of Natalia López.
  </p>
<p>
   The actra Cristina Cabib, mother of Plaza de Mayo de Quilmes and president of the Commission closed the act, who raised the situation two months after Milei's government, with the brutal adjustment. "They claim the dictatorship of Videla, they renate Malvinas, reject the workers and popular conquests, the rights of women and are against all the rights conquered by the people." Cristina developed the "Reguero de Luchas crosses Argentina", and repudiated the criminalization of the protest.
  </p>
<p>
   Then he said “today we remember that on February 14, 2019, Otto Vargas left us, our first general secretary from the foundation of the PCR in 1968. As Jacinto Roldán, current general secretary of the PCR, said:“ The story of Otto Vargas has not ended to write Because a communist, a revolutionary, does not judge him only for what he has done throughout his militant life, but for what he leaves ”and Otto Vargas leaves a PCR that has just turned 56 years at the service of the fight Revolutionary, with its JCR deployed throughout the country ”we say we are the party of Otto Vargas: we fight for the revolution.
  </p>
<p>
   “This February we said goodbye to Blanca de Freitas, mother of Plaza de May from Plaza de Mayo de Quilmes. To all of them, we tell you present! Now and always!
  </p>
<p>
   A few days after a new anniversary of the genocid coup d'etat of 1976. We call so that on March 24 there is only one march, a single stage and a single act.

<p>
   After his words, the Argentine national anthem was sung and once again, in a closed shout, we affirm "30 thousand missing detainees, present!"

   On Tuesday, February 20 at the House of Memory, the CCC -Corriente Classista Combativ Report a brutal attack, stigmatization and persecution by the National and Provincial Government, from the press conference headed by Patricia Bullrich in which Governor Leandro Zdero participated. ”
  </p>
<p>
   It is a right to replica after the complaint to Jorge Bregui, original Qom, a member of the CCC of the Leonesa, of course sexual abuse.
  </p>
<p>
   “On a complaint to a delegate of our organization that we learn from the media, the first measure we take is to separate it to investigate, but the yellow press encompasses the entire CCC, which is a national organization, because they come not only because of social and union organizations but by the Argentine people. That is the plan of President Milei and Minister Bullrich, when in reality what the government should resolve is the hunger of the people, the adjustment and inflation and the repression that they want to carry out and that we will not allow our rights to be overwhelmed And we are not going to take a step back. " Gladis Favretto, leader of the CCC said.
  </p>
<p>
   José Niz, general secretary of UPCP expressed his support; “The CCC is an organization that has achieved many claims for its members and the families of each of them, I admire their ability to organize ... and they also had to endure different types of situations that are not pleasant at all, many of us live together as together as Sister Union and Organization, which has to do with repressions over time but nevertheless never claudicated in what is its general objective and that has to do with what we propose as a union that if there are social organizations, it has to see because there is no state policy generated by genuine jobs and that this gives the dignity and equal opportunities to each and every one of the Chaqueños. ”
  </p>
<p>
   Mónica Figueroa, Reina Gómez and Simón Álvarez of the CCC of Castelli, Las Palmas and the Leonese respectively were expressed, adding that “we are not what they say, in any way, we do not accompany rapists, abusers or stalkers, never, but The truth was a situation of intimidation to the entire community, but we are not afraid ”, referring to the 7 raids made week ago.
  </p>
<p>
   Jorge Gómez and Ramona Pinay, members of the CCC and also vowels of the IDach for the Wichí and Qom ethnicity, denounced the discriminatory treatment in the raid operations, in the legal procedures and in the media: “Never the mainly national means, They dedicated so much time to issues that involve native peoples, when we are killed, missing, abused and discriminated against in the Chaco, as now when they are accused, ”they said.
  </p>
<p>
   Rodolfo Schwartz, provincial deputy said: “A message for the governor of the Chaco, we have a national government that has a program that goes more thoroughly than that of the most bloody dictatorship we had, more thoroughly than the delivery we had of our heritage , in trampling the rights of the working people and of the people in general, it has no background and intends to be an emperor ... he believes that he can do what he wants, all the governors are traitors, all the deputies are traitors, all the mayors are traitors, At least they discipline ... This governor has two paths, or hugs Milei and Bullrich repressing the people and then they will face us, or put on the side of the people at least, supporting the struggle that we are going to carry out.
  </p>
<p>
   They accompanied and expressed their support to the Organization General Secretaries of the UPCP, CTA of the Workers, ATE. Representatives of Utre Ctera, neighborhoods, south free, Evita Movement, we are neighborhoods, June 2, FOB, MTD, UTEP, Peronist Women, MTD Darío Santillán, May 25, CEPA, MOEL, FNC, UMEL , PTP and PCR, and provincial legislators Analía Flores, Gladis González and Rodolfo Schwartz.

   In front of the Ministry of Education of the Nation in CABA on 22/2, young people from popular organizations, secondary and university students, claiming an interview with officials from the Ministry of Education. Juliana Lualdi, coordinator of the movement or a kid less for the drug, told us that the central objective was to claim "in unity with a large number of organizations 500 thousand school kits, divided into initial, primary and secondary, including overalls and useful."
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   The day was held in other cities and provinces, and in many places it was unified with the route cuts of popular organizations against hunger.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   On an open radio in front of the Secretariat, the young people of the organizations present denounced the dramatic situation of hunger that grows in the popular neighborhoods, and gave concrete data of the price increases of the school basket, denounced that transport increases They make it impossible for many to reach schools and schools, and how, in addition, the government does not send food to school canteens and reduces the educational budget.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   There were among others the movement or a kid less for the drug, the strain, the Mus, the JCR, the youth of the CCC, young people standing, Evita students, youth mp dignity, union of secondary students, Peronist youth, movement arises National, we are neighborhoods, boom, Frente Patria Grande. A Capital ATE delegation headed by its Secretary General Catalan was approaching.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   Juliana told us that the day arose "from the tour of the assemblies in the neighborhoods. To the concern of hunger the beginning of the classes was added, when the school basket increased by 450%. To this we must add that transport and clothing prices make many go to school. We do this day in unity because we find many organizations with the same concern and wanting to go out to fight to be more urgent needs. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   On the other hand, Valentina Foppiani, coordinator of the Secondary Unit Movement (MUS), added that “a few days after the beginning of classes we find colleagues who will not start due to the price increase that hits the pockets of our old people. The minimum students have a monthly budget of 100 thousand pesos, and if we go to a technique it is 178 thousand. If we are a family with two or three brothers, it becomes impossible for everyone to go. And this in the midst that everything increases, except the salary of our parents.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   “The Government says that there is no money, when in reality there is money, and it is taken by those who take it in shovel and continue to enrich themselves, the great landowners and monopolies. The government chooses to adjust and adjust to the people. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   Valentina added that “the conditions in which we are going to find schools is terrible. We have no dining rooms or food, and not to mention the inputs for laboratories or cabinets. The government keeps the budget for last year frozen, when everything is 270% more expensive. We go to a critical, desperate situation and before that we understand the need to assemble and organize the bodies of delegates in each of the schools. Unite student centers to defend our education and be able to advance more budget for the number of problems we have at this time. ”
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   Nehuén Corbeletto, coordinator of the CEPA (popular anti -imperialist student current), affirmed “it seems very important to accompany the claim of social organizations and secondary students, and we add ourselves with our own claims. This government froze the university budget, and through the DNU 70, with the repeal of the rental law, it has made many thousands cannot renew the rent. If we add the terrible price increases, and remove it from transportation subsidy with the increase in the ticket, thousands of university students will not be able to continue their studies. This budget shrink is already doing, in some universities, that they cut the possibility of scoring subjects, or that begin to collect a “solidarity bonus”, as in Chivilcoy and Tucumán, to be able to study.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   That is why we are here and we will boost the unity to fight at the university that the government sends the budget items because the university's functioning is at risk. And to fight for all the claims of the students: scholarships, student ticket, dining rooms, and to turn the DNU that affects us centrally with the repeal of the rental law ”.
  </p>
<p class="normal">
   On the closing of the day, Juliana told us that a delegation was received by officials, who were given a petition by pointing out the claims of school kits, and those who denounced the real situation of thousands and thousands of kids and kids who, As the companion told, “they told us that they ate a plate of food and that they divided half for noon and half for the night. That is why we make it clear that we will follow the fight in unity to get our claims. ”

   He was born on July 1, 1940. He comes from a family with a long conservative and liberal tradition. Benegas Lynch (father) was one of the promoters of the arrival of these ideals to the country.
  </p>
<p>
   He is a liberal economist from the Austrian school, an academic associated with the United States Catón Institute, one of the most important liberal ideas laboratories in the world.
  </p>
<p>
   He is a descendant of the military José Tiburcio Benegas and the former governor of the province of Mendoza Tiburcio Benegas Ortiz. He is a second cousin of the revolutionary Ernesto Guevara. His son, Bertie Benegas Lynch is a deputy of the Nation for Freedom advances.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei considers Benegas Lynch as a "hero of liberalism" and maintains a close relationship. Benegas Lynch (h) defines liberalism as the "unrestricted respect of the neighbor's project, based on the principle of non -aggression and in defense of the right to life, freedom and property."
  </p>
<p>
   He is a defender of the dollarization of the economy and is in favor of the elimination of the Central Bank. Also of the elimination of the International Monetary Fund, since it gives "support to corrupt and broken governments." He mentioned that there were two miracles in Argentina, that they were Juan Bautista Alberdi and Javier Milei.
  </p>
<p>
   Defines as a "nonsense" the existence of Ministries of Culture and Education, since "education is a process of test and error open to provisional corroborations" and "imposing curricular structures from the vertex of power, read from the boots, is Something infamous for education. ”
  </p>
<p>
   He is critical of Pope Francis, and suggested to break diplomatic relations with the Vatican. It has been declared in favor of the sale of organs and against the sale of humans and abortion.
  </p>
<p>
   During the 2019 presidential elections, despite having supported José Luis Espert, he finally suggested that he resigned from his candidacy in support of Mauricio Macri. Subsequently it would be the intellectual link between Milei and Mauricio Macri, which culminated in the support of the latter and Patricia Bullrich to Milei's candidacy.

     Changes in the political scenario
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   Milei-Villaruel's government policy that promotes the "model" of the landowner oligarchy that threw butter into the roof and handled the country into blood and fire, now launches an offensive against the provinces, reissued the confrontation between "unit and federal." The model that claims Milei
   <strong>
    It is the oligarchic regime that ruled Argentina from 1880 to 1916.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
   Faced with this policy, popular and multisectoral struggles are joining more sectors every day, and the fights deepen in the dominant classes block, in this Argentina fiercely played by the imperialist powers. These disputes grew with the political crisis caused by the institutional coup attempt of the Government, in Congress, demanding a “buse” that until now, the product of the popular struggle, has not been able to approve.
  </p>
<p>
   Gita Gopinath, number two of the IMF, came to monitor the agreement and continuity of infamous debt payments.
  </p>
<p>
   Now Milei seeks to take over the funds of the provinces, to continue with their delivery and adjustment policy.
  </p>
<p>
   They took over the funds that, by law, are distributed between the nation and the provinces. And just as they do not allocate a single weight on the purchase of food from popular dining rooms, the government "makes cash" with money for health, education, transport and public works.
  </p>
<p>
   The Argentine Institute of Fiscal Analysis (Iaraf) published a report detailing how the adjustment imposed by the Government in public spending is. It fell 39.4% year -on -year in January, making items for retirement and pensions and energy subsidies.
  </p>
<p>
   Now he also took funds by decree to the province of Buenos Aires, and reduced from 30% to 1% The popular neighborhoods.
  </p>
<p>
   The governor of Tierra del Fuego Gustavo Melella announced that he will paralyze oil production for 24 hours in solidarity with the governor of Chubut.
  </p>
<p>
   As the statement of our party says “we fight the unity so that the struggles progress, today with the aim of twist unemployment, the delivery of national sovereignty and repression to popular struggles. ”
  </p>
<p>

<strong>
     Milei, servant of oligarchs and imperialists
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   San Martín, Belgrano, Güemes and Artigas raised funds for the war against Spain from the riches of the oligarchy that denied them, and that they sent their slaves to prevent their children from going to the liberating armies. So much so that the Salteña oligarchy ordered Güemes to kill. Milei and his heirs are servants of the heirs of that handful of landowners. While the caste of landowners, export monopolies and IMF usurers take money like never before, the working class and the people suffer as never before the crisis with the reduction of salaries, retirement, social plans, health expenses, education, education, services, transport, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   Each measure has a sector benefited with name and surname. They pounce with negotiated by putting everything they can, destroying the educational, health, cultural, research, defense, security, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   With the Chubutenses oil unions in struggle, the discount of Chubut's co -participate funds and the response of the governors of Patagonia rushed this political crisis. This was expressed in the act convened by the oil unions before the announcement of the companies that would withdraw funds from the wells of the region to allocate them to Vaca Muerta. There, the Chubutense governor Ignacio Torres, of the PRO, announced that if the National Government does not return to the province the funds they owe them, they will paralyze the export of gas and oil.
  </p>
<p>
   The six governors of the South Argentina supported the Chubutense decision. They signed a statement where they ratified that "no one can submit or extort them with threats to restrictions."
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with Milei's offensive, the solidarity of most governors advanced.

     The popular struggle deepens the dispute above
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The political crisis, deepened by the growth of popular struggles and the speed with which the provinces joined in their claim, unleashed a zafarrancho above.
  </p>
<p>
   Macri would have asked for two days to try a negotiation, but failed. Patricia Bullrich, who traveled to Washington, said from there: "In March or April they hang us from the Plaza de Mayo or, if we pass, Argentina will be a power." Bullrich formally remains the president of the PRO, and although she plays as part of the Milei government, she cultivated a deal with not a few governorates for the change. But now, before the position of the governors, Bullrich questioned that decision and began to gather signatures of the PRO in favor of Javier Milei and against what he called the "blackmail" of Ignacio Torres.
  </p>
<p>
   Given these statements of Bullrich, the PRO was even more divided, with Macri willing to take its presidency, and those who have been encouraging the possibility of an “institutional coup” with a temporary succession of the vice president, Victoria Villarruel, were reactivated.
  </p>
<p>
   Meanwhile, Milei, who traveled to Israel on February 6 and cried on the regrets, now after meeting with the Secretary of State of the Yankee Democratic Government, Antony Blinken, traveled to the United States and flirts with Trump, to whom He said they would meet again being the two presidents.

     We fight for a new active national strike
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The overwhelming unemployment of January 24 that covered the entire country and the great struggles of the occupied labor movement that continue to grow, put the working class in the center of the political scene.
  </p>
<p>
   The mobilizations against hunger this week, with the immense days of popular pots and road cuts throughout the country, united all social organizations, facing the hunger and repression policy of Milei and its minister Sandra Pettovello.
  </p>
<p>
   The political debate grows and is expressed in the sections of the factories, in the countryside, the neighborhoods, workplaces, study and among the different popular sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   The criminal policy towards retirees that puts them as a adjustment variable, since according to Milei “they are the least poor sector”, add millions of this sector to the fight that want to go to the streets to defend their rights.
  </p>
<p>
   This policy that destroys production adds to the struggle to large sectors of national bourgeoisie that go bankrupt with the measures of this government.
  </p>
<p>
   The antinational and submission measures to the governments of the United States, England and Israel fighting the patriotism of our people.
  </p>
<p>
   The women's movement that has been fighting is preparing to claim the International Worker Women's Day on March 8 in the streets of the whole country.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    The conditions to fight a new active national unemployment that one to all these sectors grow and follow the pair path of January 24.
   </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">
<strong>

    </strong>
<strong>
     Prepare and prepare the masses
    </strong>
</span>
</h3>
<p>
   The depth of the food crisis, also the health, economic, growth of drug mafias and trafficking, the total absence of national defense is brutal.
  </p>
<p>
   The government, which started with a brutal devaluation in December, advances with its adjustment and delivery plan, responding to the interests of the most reactionary sectors of the ruling classes block.
  </p>
<p>
   A recent CAME report (Argentine Confederation of the medium -sized company) indicates that food consumption lowered by 37% and food production by 22%. The consumption of medicines fell 45%, and dropped general industrial production by 30%.
  </p>
<p>
   From the beginning our party and its JCR promotes the need to face this policy, working for the broadest unity of the workers and popular sectors, even with many of Milei's voters, affected by their policy.
  </p>
<p>
   Milei and his allies, with their policy, bet to deepen the political, economic, cultural and social division in our homeland.
  </p>
<p>
   We stay at the forefront of popular emergencies and against delivery and repression, and from there we work to expand unity, because giving them time is allowing Milei to advance with their measures, which will only worsen the situation of The great masses.
  </p>
<p>
   Day by day a situation is accelerated in which the conjunction of various factors "can generate an objective revolutionary situation," as the central committee of our PCR affirmed in early January.
  </p>
<p>
   They are tumultuous moments where great changes can be produced, in which we work so that the multisectoral for the fight multiplies, fighting to be true coordinating centers of the labor and popular struggle, and thus twist the arm to Milei's policy to advance in conquering another policy and another government, in favor of the people.
  </p>
<p>
   This requires advancing in the accumulation of revolutionary forces, incorporating thousands into the PCR and the JCR, offering them a struggle. It is our duty to prepare and prepare the masses so that these changes are in favor of the working class and the people and open a revolutionary path.
  </p>
<p>
   For this way we reinforce the diffusion of our weekly, which arrives at 2000 editions this week.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    And we continue to pay tributes to our dear Otto Vargas, first general secretary of our party, five years after his death, which are a central part of reaffirming those revolutionary objectives, the same for which we founded our party 56 years ago.

<div style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: justify;">
<span style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
   Today (yesterday), February 27, 2024, the students and students of the Manzoni classical high school have occupied their school.
  </span>
</div>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   Faced with the current situation we found ourselves forced and forced to make this decision; that is, to occupy as it is the only response that can be given to the threats of Valditara, to the increasingly repressive measures of the Italian government,
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   to the repugnant accomplice silence and to the support of the western bloc to the massacre of the Palestinian people.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   Students and students are presented with the intellectual obligation to express themselves and not to remain deaf in the face of the cry of denunciation of an injustice declined in too many aspects of our lives.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   As regards the feelings of support to the Palestinian people who have prompted us to act in this way the spontaneous reflection is about the superficial and "part" way of the Italian media narration. These, that is, the main media, which are deeply corrupted by the same political power,
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   In fact, they make themselves thus proudly spokesperson for the rights in command with the agreed objective of creating the foundations of a system of silent consents around the capitalist and belligerent policies of the West. We believe that they deliberately omit and neglect important details of the current geopolitical crisis and the related participations of the co -responsible states, such as ours
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   which operates in all respects in defense of Israel: our decision not to speak with daily*was born from this observation.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   In particular, ours is an appeal, is a call to the hearts and minds of anyone who believes that the events that are marking the territory and the Palestinian people are not acceptable; of anyone who thinks that the silence of the western world, in particular of the Italian state, in front of the genocide of a people is even more unacceptable; of anyone who believes that repression has solidarity to an oppressed people is unbearable, first of all when this repression reaches students and students through "educational" feed.
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   The Italian government, in fact, for two years now, in the name of the bitter criminal populism, used as a tool for political consensus and social discrimination, is implementing an increasingly repressive narrowness towards dissent:
  </div>
</span>
<span face="sans-serif" style="white-space-collapse: preserve;">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
   It is a political line aimed at strengthening the authority of a governing class, culturally enslaved to the Euro-Atlantist powers, which implements policies, as internal as external, evidently contrary to the interests of the nation and young people, in the complete silence and accomplice of the so-called " opposition". Ours is no longer a democracy but a political system in which forces of
