     The war has been found since the end of the summer of 2022 in a situation 
 of balance, that the commentators and politicians of imperialism consider 
 as of stagnation, predicting that neither can reach the 
 victory in a predictable time and that both contestants accuse a situation 
 of exhaustion or weakening, which is to be considered, because in the front 
 military Russian imperialism is like an elephant in a swamp no

 different from the other lines of the front where they have nothing more than Advances and 
 recoil, where Russian imperialists have their "battle of the marne" 
 They are bogged down. The situation is that Russian imperialists are the 
 aggressors and the Ukrainian resistance is that of a nation attacked in defransa of 
 your contry. For the former time he urges, while for the Ukrainians 
 They have to fulfill their sacred mission without sparing effort or time. In 
 Any case the development of the military situation there will depend a lot on the 
 Development of the internal situation of the forces of each of the sides 
 contenders and the development of the international situation as a whole. That is why we read a part of a report from another reactionary source:

 Scale, the front line in Ukraine no longer moves. The weakening of 
 Western military support is forcing kyiv to a wear war, 
 While Putin has put Russia in a war economy. How are you

 Main phases of war since February 2022.
