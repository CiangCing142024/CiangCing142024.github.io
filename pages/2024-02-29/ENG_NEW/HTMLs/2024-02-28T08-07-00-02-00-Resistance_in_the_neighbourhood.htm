    ORGANIZATION AND AGAINS FOR A SYSTEM

  Folk rage is inflating against anti -populist government policy. People, youth and workers see, full of indignation, their lives downgrade, their rights to shrink, their income to be cut. At the same time that a money laundering flows to imperialist funds for beastly military equipment. At the same time as the local big -bodied class, which gives all kinds of freedom to profitable at the expense of the broad popular masses and in more and more fields, such as education and care.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The indignation overflows a year after the state crime in Tempi, with 57 dead and dozens of injuries. A crime that proved the frosty indifference of this system for human life and has led to magnificent mobilizations across the country. A crime that the government and state mechanisms want to hide. A crime that will not be forgotten!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Samples of this rage are the great struggles of students and farmers. Games that have nothing to do with some "minorities" are not caprices or obsessions, as the media are presented by them. They are struggles for the right to life!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such examples are the workers' struggles that sprout from "nowhere", breaking the apparent immobility, which many want to present as a struggle. The race of Tunisian workers in the workshop of Teleperformance is a recent example where employees are looking for their racing pace, in the same way that e-food and artists' mobilizations broke out or the magnificent long-term struggle in Malamatina.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These struggles express the moods of the great popular majority that narrows under barbaric anti -populist politics. Moods that do not fit into the various electoral plans that are re -eating shortly before the European elections. Moods that are not redeemed in the polls. Moods that need to highlight the direction of mass struggle, the front of resistance and claim, which is the only one who can shake bourgeoisie, to win, to overthrow the barbaric policy.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  • These are the moods that intensify the concern of the system centers. Because they show the real situation, beyond all kinds of custom statistics. This concern of the system is also shown through the rabies with which it attacks any popular and labor reaction. Repression and persecutions are on the agenda. Against students and occupations, against farmers and blocks, against students and any suspicion of their mobilization, against teachers, against strikes, against unions. The Law of Hatzidakis, the laws on demonstrations, and the new amendment of the Criminal Code are moving in exactly that direction: terrorism and criminal extermination of those who are fighting and claiming.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So let this strike be another reason for concern for its capital and system! Let it be an opportunity to en masse labor, the resistance to anti -labor policy and the claim of work and life with rights.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Against the forces of consensus and subordination they made it to "get out of the obligation" and declare the end of the games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Let it be a step towards the further establishment of the People's and Labor Movement, a step towards the people and workers.
