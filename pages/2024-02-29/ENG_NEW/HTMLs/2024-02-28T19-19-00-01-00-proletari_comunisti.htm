 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The first pages of the great print today are all concentrated 
 on the outcome of the elections in Sardinia.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We don't think 
 that the elections are currently the tool to change things, just as we don't think that the elections in our country are really 
 democratic, but they are, instead, as Marx says, to choose between candidates who 
 they have to do the interests of the dominant class and this applies to the 
 center -right candidates as well as for center candidates 
 left.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is 
 it also became clear to the consistent masses of the population, dei 
 proletarians, of the poor masses of our country, so much so that the 
 natural response to this situation - or the non -response - was 
 the massive abstentionism. This massive abstentionism is 
 check now in all elections, to a greater or lesser extent a 
 depending on the type of elections.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Even the elections 
 In Sardinia they have seen a slight growth of abstentionism 
 compared to the previous regional ones. These are quite things 
 clear.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The system 
 politician of the parties in Italy and the governments that are born they are 
 all governments at the service of the owners and the dominant class and in 
 General what they say in the elections is not realized. All 
 What they promise to proletarians and masses is not realized. 
 Everything they promise to the masters and the dominant class 
 It is realized. Not only that, but also what they do not promise, that not 
 they say in the elections, once they are in power they do it without 
 no scruple and boast all this as if they were “promises 
 electoral "," it is a vote that sent us to power, it is the vote that 
 It allows us to do, in the end, everything we want ”.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now the elections 
 In Sardinia they are not different from the elections of all kinds of type 
 that we have had in recent years, nor will they be different from 
 future elections.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are for a 
 new really democratic state in which proletarian workers, the 
 popular masses can freely elect their representatives in 
 a picture in which, however - it is clear - that the interests of the proletarians e 
 of the masses must prevail over the interests of the masters and the 
 exploiters, parasites. This possibility is not in the present 
 electoral system and therefore this is not what we can today 
 speak.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  However the 
 electoral result in Sardinia is a political result from 
 carefully evaluate in the context of the current political situation. 
 In this sense it is also a positive result for us. Positive from 
 point of view of proletarians and masses, from the point of view 
 of the social and political opposition to this government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Two factors there 
 they seem important: the government parties, through a clash between 
 gangs between them, gave birth to a candidate who is in substance is 
 been defeated. The center -right candidate was defeated 
 Because imposed by Meloni. So it is also a personal defeat 
 of the Meloni and the party that represents it. It is also a defeat 
 of the coalition because the party that wanted to express the 
 candidate, renewing the mandate, the League, made fire and 
 flames before the elections for the candidate Solinas to remain the 
 candidate-president, then Meloni set himself with the support of 
 Forza Italia and the candidate Solinas of the League has been set aside.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As a result 
 concrete, an evident part of the League electorate voted the 
 Lists but did not vote for the candidate of Fratelli d'Italia.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It's not that we 
 We think the League candidate was better, Solinas is a 
 criminal, is a candidate also investigated by the judiciary for the 
 way in which he managed the Region, for the link with illegal affairs. 
 But this contradiction in the row of the dominant coalition is 
 was a weak ring of the center -right parties and of these 
 rings there are several in all elections and in management 
 also daily of this government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Everything that 
 feeds the division in the government, in the dominant class, is 
 Objectively positive. On the other hand, the vote in Sardinia expresses, 
 In the band of those who voted, a clear no to the government and a clear yes 
 Also to the figure of the center -left candidate.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The candidate, a 
 difference of other candidates of the center -left, at least in the electoral phase, is 
 characterized by a more radical position of social opposition 
 and politics at the local level, in Sardinia, and nationally against 
 The Meloni government. Rightly this candidate spoke of 
 Fascists to the government and rightly appealed to anti -fascism 
 Against this government, coming out of Mrs. Meloni, irrelevant that he has 
 disturbed a significant part of the electorate it saw 
 This mixture of presumption and arrogance and has had greater reasons 
 To convince himself that he is a fascist and that he had not been voted.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other question 
 is that the candidate does not 
 It was part of the extablish of the Democratic Party and this is also a value 
 added, because the establishment of the Democratic Party, in most of the 
 cases, certainly does not represent an alternative to the government of 
 center -right. So it was not part of this establishment, it was 
 more linked to the 5 Star Movement and to Conte, he used well 
 This "third" figure of his to conduct an election campaign 
 more radical and clearer. As we have 
 appreciated that one of his first statements was full 
 denunciation and solidarity with students attacked in Pisa and logic 
 of public order management as a police state, modern 
 Fascism, by Salvini who puts his face and Meloni 
 who is the great direction or the contact person of all this dirt of 
 which we have already talked about yesterday's counter -information.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So this 
 vote weakens the government, for now, and strengthens social opposition 
 and politics at least within the framework of the institutions and the electorate.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For us 
 The social and political opposition is the one that moves outside the 
 Parliament, is the one expressed for example from the 100,000 they have 
 manifested and striked on the occasion of last week, the 
 23/24, around the nodal question of Palestine, who then 
 It means the complaint of the complicity of the government in the massacre 
 genocida that is taking place in Palestine and the complaint of a government 
 that, in addition to being an accomplice of Israel, marches towards the war.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The opposition 
 social and political is the one that moves in the jobs, in 
 territories, to claim salary, rights, the defense of health 
 of safety in the workplace in front of the gigantic chain 
 of dead, is the one that rekindles the outbreaks of rebellion in the 
 schools in solidarity with Palestine - which is the reason for 
 latest detective positions - but in general to question the model 
 of school that wants us to impose the fascists in the government and theirs 
 Minister Valditara. And at the same time the movement of women who 
 With great events - and new important ones are announced 
 Initiatives for March 8 - He is putting the general force on the field 
 of women against the policies of this government, 
 within a criticism that certainly goes beyond this government, 
 it concerns "the first" of this government and will also concern "the 
 after ”of this government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is the true 
 social and political opposition. This social and political opposition 
 It should be built and organized in political forms: the party of 
 proletariat of the oppressed, the united front of all those who 
 they fight this government, the state of capital the construction of 
 a force of the masses capable of not allowing the violence of 
 Was the face of the master.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this is 
 helped by contradictions within the bourgeoisie, to the parties of the 
 Parliament and is helped by what happens also in the elections.
