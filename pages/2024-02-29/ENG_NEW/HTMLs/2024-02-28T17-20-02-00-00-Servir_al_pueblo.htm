  The proletarian woman loads the weight of the double oppression on her shoulders: the capitalist and the patriarchal. On the one hand he is a workers, suffering the capitalist exploitation of wage labor. On the other hand, she is a woman under the class society where the patriarchy develops, suffering the reactionary force of custom and tradition, which maintains the yoke of domestic work once her workday ends.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-288ffe12e43069d1b206809702fdc00e">
  And this is not enough, the capitalist and patriarchal exploitation suffered by the proletarian woman is intertwined, still making the living conditions worse. The proletarian woman concentrates, in the labor market, in those sectors with worse working conditions and suffers dismembrance, humiliation and sexual harassment. Meanwhile, in the domestic field, it suffers the consequences of these bad working conditions: it cannot reconcile family life and is forced to work with departure and/or partial days. From the relationship between capitalist and patriarchal oppression, at the time of imperialism in its greater phase of decomposition, it develops the most cruel forms of discrimination, vexation and humiliation. Even of sexual slavery, such as prostitution.
 </p>

  Given this general situation, the panorama does not improve in the Spanish context. The salary gap - the structural difference between what a man and a woman charges in the same jobs - remains. Although the Government, the State institutions and the union domes - which follow bourgeois feminism - affirm that the salary gap has fallen, are based solely and exclusively on data from the increase in the minimum interprofessional salary (SMI), leaving out millions of women They work in black. The right to abortion is continuously attacked reactionary and ultra -critical groups -directly or indirectly financed by institutions, parties of the bourgeoisie and by the Catholic Church -, which carry out harassment and demolition campaigns in front of the abortive clinics, blackmailing in all possible ways To women who want to abort. The few public nurseries that are - and not in all cities - hinders the lives of mothers, especially single mothers.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bee89de5e40f27dead4ae4549ced3a6c">
  We cannot lose sight of youth, whose culture and way of thinking is hard beaten by the ideological offensive of imperialism, developing cruel forms of patriarchal oppression towards girls and adolescents. Several cases of violation have occurred in pack for children under 16. If the harassment and hypersexualization that undergoes girls and adolescents in schools and institutes, new technological tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) are used as blackmail tools and extortion tools are not little harassment and hypersexualization. Thus, the case of how a group of students distributed false photographs created by the where they were naked companions were sounded. During the class society, imperialism and patriarchal violence, those advances that should be good for humanity, such as AI, are used for imperialist war, sexual harassment and other type of patriarchal violence.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b530e52ea15dbb2e24ae4b046ef53a05">
  It is visible as the hypersexualization caused by the canons or standards of patriarchal beauty affects youth, but not only to it. The proletarian woman, of all ages, is strongly subject to this social pressure. It is notorious how the number of aesthetic operations from 2014 to 2021 has increased by 215%, where it is women who carry out these operations (85% of the operations are intended for women). The most common operations are chest implants, rhinoplasty, liposuction and modifications in the face in general. The large increase in aesthetic operations is due to a reduction in the price of surgery and in the popularization of installments, added to strong patriarchal pressure. This cruel is patriarchal violence.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4598f078eb1a86bad06cad05c7f7e190">
  All these cases are practical examples of how at the time of imperialism, in the phase of its greatest decomposition, the cultural expression of patriarchal violence becomes even more atrocious and humiliating for proletarian women.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4bbd1ebeb7b9b60ba4399f8fad4ace48">
  Patriarchal violence, in all its forms, whips women in all areas of her life. In 2023, 101 macho murders were officially counted. In what we have of 2024 there are at least 10. There is no defense against violated or attacked women. The "most progressive government" government claims to be a feminist, but does not defend the proletarian woman in the face of abuse at work, does not break the yoke that binds to the home or protects it from those who hits or viola them.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-cd1ddb4de41424110d7d0024fe320509">
  Being "victim of gender violence" by bourgeois justice is a maze where many women do not get it. Either because they do not have economic resources -we know that free justice provided by the State is something that does not work in real life -because institutions do not guarantee the right to complaint -how will you be able to denounce a woman if The police laugh at her or not believe it? There are few cases of violations at the police station, prisons or foreigners' internment centers (CIE). Are you going to trust a woman attacked in the aggressors?- Or either for anything else.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-84cd1a6c1606767b42b54b48eb29554e">
  Even trusting bourgeois justice, being considered "victim of gender violence" and ending up condemning the aggressor macho, that does not guarantee anything. There are few news that in the past 2023 we could see how a convicted of gender violence murders to his ex -partner for revenge. Those convicted lead a normal life beyond punishment - him and punctual - that at the time they are imposed. There are even regional and national deputies who were sentenced in a final sentence, are presented to the elections and are elected!
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-662826edfb88954df34e5cd490e9dd41">
  The conclusion is that the proletarian woman who rebels and wants to cut ties with the aggressor with whom she lives, cannot. If you denounce, you are not assured of the victory. If you get the legal victory, the protection of a punctual revenge is not insured. If you have children, you are not insured to keep the children and the aggressor can have the total or shared custody of them.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-300530ee41819c2de13805518f15dbd7">
  We cannot forget how imperialism, Spanish imperialism in this case, is primed with the women of the semi -dependent and semi -feudal countries dominated by imperialism. The most common prostitute profile in Spain is that of a Colombian woman between 23 and 28 years old. More than 90% of prostituted women are foreign, mainly from these oppressed countries (Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa). In Huelva, the laborers of the strawberry - which are mainly Moroccan - suffer days of misery, along with numerous cases of sexual violations and abuse they have denounced. Latin American women, throughout the country, are the most employed and sought -after profile for cleaning and domestic care, often being internal in the residence where they live and in semi -cutting conditions.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ebe0241c2ae658405d04f11e461ccf53">
  The "most progressive government" government, the government that claims to be a feminist, does not protect proletarian women. And he will never, this or any other government, because due to the very essence of a government of this nature (which manages the interests of the imperialist bourgeois state), he cannot end the nature of the patriarchal problem (originated in the class society and which develops in the time of monopoly capitalism, that is, imperialism). The government can only mitigate the problem, and not even effectively!
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-305fa471a88c9d7494c20b06669e39b9">
  Faced with bourgeois feminism in all its variants, there was no purely proletarian feminism that imposed the class position of the proletariat, which is none other than the organization, mobilization and politicization of proletarian women to destroy imperialism and class society to destroy Thus, patriarchy. The proletarian woman can only free themselves as a class, because the problems she suffers are directly derived from the class society.
 </p>
 <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7eec4dd1764310025c42c102edc02172">
  Faced with bourgeois feminism, we must defend, fly and apply proletarian feminism. The proletarian woman cannot be a slave for much longer. The centuries of oppression, humiliation, violence and exploitation in all its forms must be sent to the place from which it should never leave: the dump of history.
