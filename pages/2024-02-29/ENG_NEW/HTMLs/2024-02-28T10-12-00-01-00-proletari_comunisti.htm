  On February 26, that is, a couple of days after deserting 
 In fact, the Kiev meeting, Macron resumes the scene and throws a lot of petrol 
 On the fire of the enlargement of the war scenario saying that it is necessary 
 send soldiers to fight in Ukraine against Russia: “I do not exclude troops 
 of war ”, and the French newspaper Le Monde online this morning says that 
 "Emmanuel Macron insists on the possible sending of soldiers to Ukraine".

  <p class="MsoNormal">
   Macron, in the name of French imperialism, during "his" 
 Meeting did the hard with the 
 "Presidents, first ministers and responsible for 27 countries" with one 
 "Slaving verbal escalation" says today's manifesto: inviting everyone 
 first "to" get a move "to increase the handings of armaments", then a 
 consider the sending of "earth troops", but despite having to take note 
 that "" there is no consent "for the moment", he kept to point out that "nothing must 
 Being excluded, everything is possible if it is useful ", because" to defeat Russia is 
 essential"." Well backed in this by Prime Minister Attal who “has 
 explained that "nothing cannot be excluded in a war that takes place in the heart 
 of Europe "."

   Almost all the guests have hurried to put the 
 hands forward with a real "avalanche of appeals to prudence", in

   "The

 This eventuality will be assessed "only when Ukraine is a member of the

  <p class="MsoNormal">
   "The

   : “Drastical German Chancellor Scholz:« Not 
 There will be troops on the ground or soldiers on Ukrainian soil sent by European States 
 or from NATO States, there is a great unanimity on the question ""

 scale »of troops in addition to the" small number "already on the spot to support 
 Ukraine, particularly in the medical field

   "Don't agree" to send troops, you have to

   For the

   , just entered the NATO, the question «al 
 Moment is not relevant ».

   "It does not plan to send troops" and "you don't have to 
 speculate on the future ".

   “Already it

   , which does not send "neither weapons nor soldiers".

   “
   <b>

   , which is one of the few neutral states, is 
 definitely "against" and says that we need "a perspective 
 diplomatics ", while it is" surprising to bring out a topic that does not do 
 consent and creates a debate we don't need "
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   All these who for now, therefore, at least in words, have 
 Taken the distances, they were criticized by the Macron warflower imperialist: 
 "Many people who today say 'never, never' were the same as two years ago 
 They said "never tanks, never planes, never missiles long -haul" ".
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   But in fact no one denies weapons. Among the decisions 
 He took on Monday: Cyber-Difesa against Russian attacks on the allies; 
 co-production of weapons and ammunition; commitment to defend the threatened countries, such as 
 La Moldova; ability to support Ukraine at the border with Belarusia 
 with non -military forces; Smoking operations.
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   And, moreover, “a new coalition for the 
 Delivery of medium and long range missiles (more than 70 km, such as the boots, 
 while Germany still holds back on the Taurus), and 15 countries support the initiative 
 Czech to recover ammunition between those who own them. " while “Parliament 
 European yesterday approved long -term support for Ukraine. "
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   The immediate position was not lacking 
 Russian imperialism: “The conflict between Russia and NATO will be 
 "Inevitable" if the West sends troops to Ukraine ".
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   Macron with this dangerous Boutade Warfundia has 
 However, put the "total war option" on the carpet!
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   This "discussion" on the possibility-necessity for the 
 capitalism-imperialism of the "total war" as you know will have another moment 
 Important to the next G7 to be held in Puglia in June.
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   On this we must repeat what we said in the 
 Yesterday's counter -information: “As it was in other G7, just remember the G7 of 
 Genoa - their base of unit to build war plans even more, i 
 plans of the oppression of peoples, the plans for the immediation of peoples, the plans 
 For the use of artificial intelligence for war purposes, the plans for 
 transform all climatic, environmental events, all the crises of 
 crisis, immigration, in a strenuous defense of a putrid and dying system e 
 oppose it with the violence of the armies, bombs, the army of the proletarians 
 and of the oppressed peoples that in all forms, in large and small forms, yes 
 opposes all this.
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">
   All at the G7 in Puglia to make evident that the world is 
 divided into two hills: the hill of imperialism, the hill of the proletarians, 
 of the peoples and all those who do not accept the world that are there 
 building and preparing, the horrible future, and the will to put an end to 
 This horror.
