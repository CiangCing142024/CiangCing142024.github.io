   Before the offensive wave against freedoms, human rights and denial to the genocide of the coup d'etat of 1976, we summon ourselves, as every year, to remind our class and revolutionary leader, a member of the Political Commission of the Central Committee of the PCR , René Salamanca.
  </p>
  <p>
   We do it at a time when those who raise this repressive climate do so to stop people's struggles against national adjustment and delivery. When the destinies of the country are put into play, figures such as René gain more validity.
  </p>
  <p>
   On a new anniversary of the Automotive Mechanic Day, we invite you to participate in the act that will discover the new commemorative plaque of its validity, in the square that bears his name.
  </p>
  <p>
   Wednesday, February 28, 18.30 Hs. Plaza René Salamanca, Santa Isabel neighborhood.
  </p>
  <p>
   Invites and organizes: Permanent Tribute Commission to René Salamanca.
