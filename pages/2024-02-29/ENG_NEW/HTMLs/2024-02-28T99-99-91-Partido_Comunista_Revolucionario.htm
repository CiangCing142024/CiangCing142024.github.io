   We appreciate the broad solidarity received for the partner from unions, organizations and personalities committed to the human rights of Córdoba.
  </p>
  <p>
   On 19/2 in hours at noon, the teacher of the blue and white and councilor of Agua de Oro, Cecilia Panzetta, was violently threatened in the collective when he was heading to Río Ceballos.
  </p>
  <p>
   As a teacher, he has headed the implementation of the ESI, and on previous occasions he has been defamed by the networks and personally attacked. As a councilor, he has been part of those who headed the rejection of the Bus Law and the DNU.
  </p>
  <p>
   While the reactionary sectors and the president himself believe they are enabled to intimidate and threaten, characters like this man embargo. In a cowardly act he said: "I know where you live," "I'm going to burn you," "I know that you are a teacher in the village and have problems for indoctrinator," "I am liberal libertarian to the core and even death." Everything that happened is included in the judicial complaint based immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
   Made the complaint, the UEPC teaching guild and other Ctera base guilds, Teaching Groups of Córdoba, the United Agua de Oro Front, the national deputy Gabriela Estévez, Hilda Bustos Secretary of the CGT, the provincial legislators Federico Alessandri and Luciana Presas and companions of the PSOL, Popular Unit and other UXP parties, members of local governments of the Chicas Sierras Corridor, collective of local women and other allies and sectors have sent their solidarity, expressing repudiation to antidemocratic actions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enough of harassment, persecution and intimidation to those who face Milei's anti -democratic adjustment and policy.
