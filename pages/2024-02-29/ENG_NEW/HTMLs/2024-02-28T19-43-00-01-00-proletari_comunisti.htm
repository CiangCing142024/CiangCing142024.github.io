 We want to consider what is happening on 
 front of the war.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The premier 
 French, Macron, said he is ready to do more and send direct troops and pushes the allies born/he uses to send their troops directly to Ukraine to fight the Russians if Ukraine loses in the clash with 
 Russia - as in fact is happening - because the disaster 
 represented by the Zelensky regime is also reflected in what 
 It is the war conducted by Ukraine, with generals changed like 
 Capricci, with masses, especially young people and people tired of the 
 war and tired of Zelensky's politics that wants weapons, weapons, 
 weapons, as if the contrast between the popular and proletarian masses 
 of Ukraine and Russia had its key in arms and not being 
 Instead the armament that comes from western countries, from states 
 United and from NATO countries. And this is one of the elements that show that this 
 war is not the war of the proletarians and the Ukrainian masses, but it is the 
 War by interposed person of the imperialist powers: Russia 
 which has invaded and, even more, the United States, NATO, countries 
 Europeans who are already participating in this war in all ways. 
 And this, far from being a peace factor has become one 
 unstoppable march towards a general conflict.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This declaration of Macron as well as revealing 
 that this war - the imperialists - want it even more than Ukrainians, is one 
 heavy fuse in the picture of the food of this war that 
 actually it can become officially what it is already 
 in a hidden form, with everything that is connected to the war with it 
 carrying out it as a great carnage of peoples, soldiers, 
 of all the businesses engaged, but also a great factor of profits 
 For the true masters of governments which are the great multinationals, 
 The war industry.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  As soon as Macron has 
 Having said that, NATO, Germany and even the United States have 
 Immediately said that no, we don't foresee this. But is not so. Their 
 words are hypocritical. These steps are not made by announcing them on 
 newspapers, evidently.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  NATO, American imperialism, the various European governments, are not ready 
 To take these direct participation steps with soldiers 
 on the territory of Ukraine. Also because they don't have consent 
 internal on this, both that of the polls that tells us how the 
 most of the "public opinions" within these 
 countries, although certainly not agreeing on the Russian invasion 
 of Ukraine, they are certainly not for the war, I'm not for the 
 amazing increase in military expenditure that are overthrown on 
 popular masses.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Macron did not have 
 say this because all the countries are still ready to do it and neither 
 They are united in the real interests to defend in order to do it. 
 However, this highlights what they really want to do.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Macron also said it as part of trying to resume consent in the country 
 and characterize as the only possible government that allows you to 
 realize the imperialist interests of France inside e 
 Outside against the threat represented - threatens in order to 
 Say - from the advance of Le Pen. Therefore to maintain power, for 
 arise as the main servant of the interests of imperialism, 
 Macron does not hesitate to want to drag France into war and to make 
 clear what other countries are already doing, see Italy 
 closely aligned on Ukraine and who intends to do much more 
 on Ukraine also in the context of the current figure of the government 
 Italian and Meloni as president on duty of the G7 to be held 
 In Italy in mid -June.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All of these 
 they want war, all of these want to bring the 
 war. All of these want to transform their countries into countries 
 militarized and war economy and all these do it for the 
 profits and for the interests of the masters. And all this do it in 
 All chessers in the world, from Ukraine to Palestine, to the Middle 
 East, in Asia, where world fires are about to burst 
 even larger dimensions than those already in progress.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This leads us to 
 enhance the importance of manifesting against war and against 
 governments. Solidarity with the Palestinian people, stop the genocide, 
 The ceased the fire must be combined with the relaunch in each country of the struggle 
 against the imperialist war, against the participation of their own 
 governments and their soldiers to wars, against the amazing increase 
 of the war economy and against the internal effects of all this 
 What are more dictatorship, more repression, less democracy.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The workers, the workers, the oppressed, must clear that there is a link between their material condition and what that 
 It happens in the world: what the world prepare for the proletarians, for the popular masses, for the 
 their children, etc.?
