   It is a right to replica after the complaint to Jorge Bregui, original Qom, a member of the CCC of the Leonesa, of course sexual abuse.
  </p>
  <p>
   “On a complaint to a delegate of our organization that we learn from the media, the first measure we take is to separate it to investigate, but the yellow press encompasses the entire CCC, which is a national organization, because they come not only because of social and union organizations but by the Argentine people. That is the plan of President Milei and Minister Bullrich, when in reality what the government should resolve is the hunger of the people, the adjustment and inflation and the repression that they want to carry out and that we will not allow our rights to be overwhelmed And we are not going to take a step back. " Gladis Favretto, leader of the CCC said.
  </p>
  <p>
   José Niz, general secretary of UPCP expressed his support; “The CCC is an organization that has achieved many claims for its members and the families of each of them, I admire their ability to organize ... and they also had to endure different types of situations that are not pleasant at all, many of us live together as together as Sister Union and Organization, which has to do with repressions over time but nevertheless never claudicated in what is its general objective and that has to do with what we propose as a union that if there are social organizations, it has to see because there is no state policy generated by genuine jobs and that this gives the dignity and equal opportunities to each and every one of the Chaqueños. ”
  </p>
  <p>
   Mónica Figueroa, Reina Gómez and Simón Álvarez of the CCC of Castelli, Las Palmas and the Leonese respectively were expressed, adding that “we are not what they say, in any way, we do not accompany rapists, abusers or stalkers, never, but The truth was a situation of intimidation to the entire community, but we are not afraid ”, referring to the 7 raids made week ago.
  </p>
  <p>
   Jorge Gómez and Ramona Pinay, members of the CCC and also vowels of the IDach for the Wichí and Qom ethnicity, denounced the discriminatory treatment in the raid operations, in the legal procedures and in the media: “Never the mainly national means, They dedicated so much time to issues that involve native peoples, when we are killed, missing, abused and discriminated against in the Chaco, as now when they are accused, ”they said.
  </p>
  <p>
   Rodolfo Schwartz, provincial deputy said: “A message for the governor of the Chaco, we have a national government that has a program that goes more thoroughly than that of the most bloody dictatorship we had, more thoroughly than the delivery we had of our heritage , in trampling the rights of the working people and of the people in general, it has no background and intends to be an emperor ... he believes that he can do what he wants, all the governors are traitors, all the deputies are traitors, all the mayors are traitors, At least they discipline ... This governor has two paths, or hugs Milei and Bullrich repressing the people and then they will face us, or put on the side of the people at least, supporting the struggle that we are going to carry out.
