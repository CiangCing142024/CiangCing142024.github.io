  that US and Norwegian imperialism have made an agreement allowing several new US military bases in Norway.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement (SDCA) was signed on the 2
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of February by the Norwegian Minister of Defense, Bjørn Arild Gram, and the US Ambassador to Norway, Marc Nathanson. The agreement will have to be approved by the parliament before it can take into effect, and might require a three fourth majority to be passed. This majority has already been achieved as the parties representing the large majority of the parliament have voiced their support for the agreement.
 </p>
 <p>
  While the Norwegian Governments have had a line against military bases of other countries in Norway since 1949, several so called “united areas” have been created in the last years. These areas are mainly used by the US, which can build out its military infrastructure there, but other NATO members can also use it for military purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The SDCA agreement is an extension of a defense agreement between the US and Norway, that was approved by the Norwegian parliament in June of 2022. As part of the agreement the US currently has four unified areas in military bases in Norway. The new agreement proposes the creation of eight new areas. The majority of the existing and proposed unified areas are in military airports.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similar agreements have also been made between the other Nordic imperialists counties and US imperialism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland signed bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCAs) with the US in December of 2023. The agreements, which have not yet taken into effect, proposes the creation of 17 unified areas in Sweden, 15 in Finland and 3 in Denmark.
