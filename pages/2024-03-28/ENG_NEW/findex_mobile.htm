   The cancellation of fines by the municipality was the result of the mobilizations in which our organization, the complaints, the protests at the Athens City Council, the decisive policy of refusing to pay them and the claim to cancel all fines, all the fines immediately, for post -adhesion imposed. Both in herself and other forces (KKE, days25).

   The struggle must continue, with the aim of canceling the fines imposed by the Attica Region, as well as to defend free political action, trafficking of ideas, posters, banner suspension, demonstration and strike. Right rights, which are also targeted by the system attack, with various pretexts.

Today more than ever we raise the flags of the never above all at this time and this context of adjustment, repression, delivery and sufferings for the Argentine people. The Milei -Villarruel government denies that it was a genocide and claims the genocides. That is why we raise our voices to say: No to the impunity of yesterday and today, 30,000 detainees -disappeared present, memory, truth and justice.

  , Santiago Pedraz, ordered the Telegram application to suspend the copyright infringement by copyright.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-df59c6161de292c2270adae395d4b559">
  On March 23, the news was known that a judge of the National Court, the court that has jurisdiction throughout the state, ordered Telegram's complete closure in the country because of a complaint of the great bourgeois press monopolies : Mediaset, Atresmedia and Movistar Plus. The reason was the alleged "unauthorized" use of audiovisual content owned by bourgeois press monopolies. That is, they ensure that their programs were shared “illegally” by some channels of the Telegram messaging application.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-08ed5691e8d7a52012111ceb471af0e6">
  Given this accusation, the instruction judge ordered, in a precautionary way, to close the use of the messaging application while the investigation will be carried out. However, given the lack of compliance with the company, computer operators were decided to temporarily block the telegram connection in the Spanish State. The argument used by the judge is that, while the content is housed in the application, it is not excess of being able to complete the application.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bb4deed8c186d3e6af860b9f19f9ccb3">
  Although at no time did it stop working, and today March 25, the judge himself has reversed and has paralyzed his closure while the investigation lasts, being able to close in the future if the conviction is so decreed. Different "justice" organizations had put a complaint against the judge for serious, severe and unprecedented limitation of
  <a href="https://theobjective.com/espana/tribunales/2024-03-25/denuncian-juez-pedraz-prevaricacion-telegram/">
   Fundamental rights
  </a>
  ”.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f1e1996b092227982268cce1d40d3cbe">
  Telegram is an application that in the Spanish State adds 8.5 million users, and is mainly known for its alleged greater security with respect to other instant messaging applications. This means that Telegram is not only used on a personal level, but that activist groups use this application as a method of disseminating their activities.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-362f066160efd3428dc8ea9ceb406033">
  Thus, this conviction, although not carried out at the moment, shows the tendency of the imperialist states to attack democratic rights. Prioritizing the "right" of the great communication monopolies to obtain economic revenue through their "intellectual property", it was aiming one of the most security applications that is known by the police that use the anti -fascist movements, of national liberation and of the movement for housing. These movements would have already been fiercely repressed through police infiltrations on several occasions, as we report in previous
  <a href="https://heraldorojo.org/2023/09/08/espana-destapada-nueva-infiltracion-policial-en-madrid/">
   occasions

  .
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-e3af5a42d139e76f05a58c5bb8a8031f">
  No application is completely safe. However, it is no accident that it has been indicated directly to Telegram, where political content is shared by different organizations. Moreover, when Telegram had already collaborated with the European bourgeois "justice" in a similar case (protection of "intellectual rights").

<p>
  Former President Jair Bolsonaro spent two nights at Hungary diplomatic headquarters at an apparent political asylum request. This occurred four days after Jair Bolsonaro was forced to deliver his passport during Operation Tempus Veritatis.
 </p>
<p>
  The operation of the Federal Police occurred from a decision of the Federal Supreme Court. She served arrest warrants, search and seizure and precautionary measures. Among the latter was precisely the delivery of Jair Bolsonaro's passport.
 </p>
<p>
  Bolsonaro spoke shortly after the news, confirming that he was at the Hungary embassy for two days. In an interview with Metrópoles newspaper, he stated:
 </p>
<p>
  “I won't deny that I was in the embassy. I won't talk where I was most. I keep a circle of friendship with some heads of state around the world. They are concerned. I talk to them subjects of interest to our country. And point. The rest is speculation ”,
 </p>
<p>
  According to the images obtained by the New York Times, you can see Jair Bolsonaro walking on the embassy. Your car came in shortly thereafter. According to the US newspaper of the US communication monopoly, the former president spent two days in the embassy accompanied by two security guards. He was accompanied by the Hungarian ambassador and members of the diplomatic team.
 </p>
<p>
  Of course, besides the articulation of the far right, Bolsonaro did not do it just to "talk to heads of state." It was also to prevent a prison, since, by law, the embassy is out of reach of the national authorities.
 </p>
<p>
  This is not the first time Bolsonaro plans to escape to get rid of arrests. On December 29, 2022, the captain traveled to the United States in a double goal: first, to avoid being involved with what was happening in the following days (which was confirmed on January 8); Second, to avoid passing the presidential range to Luiz Inacio. This time Bolsonaro tried to escape to Hungary so as not to be arrested.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
<strong>
   Hungarian political analyst says Bolsonaro would receive asylum in Hungary
  </strong>
</h4>
<p>
  In an interview with the Press Monopoly O Globo, Hungarian political analyst Gyula Nagy, professor at the University of Corvinus, said that: “If Bolsonaro asks Orbán for help, the answer will be positive. They are allies, I would say that friends. ”
 </p>
<p>
  About this, the analyst recalled that this type of asylum has been offered by Orbán to other far right politicians before. In 2018, former Northern Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski received the status of political refugee in Hungary after being the target of a series of corruption, extortion, electoral manipulation, among others. It would be not new to Hungarian politics, therefore, if another right-wing and well-known former criminal asylum asylum, as it seems that Bolsonaro is doing.
 </p>
<p>
  The analyst's speeches confirm the analysis that the revealed articulation represents a coordination of the far right at the international level.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Alexandre de Moraes gives Bolsonaro 48 hours to clarify his visit
 </h4>
<p>
  On March 26, STF Minister Alexandre de Moraes opened 48 hours for the former president to clarify the reason for his 2-day stay at the embassy. Bolsonaro's visit can be configured as an attempt to evade the country so as not to be arrested.
 </p>
<p>
  Article 312 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that one of the reasons for pre -trial detention is the risk of non -compliance with criminal law, ie escape or risk of escape. In this sense, it would mean non -compliance with one of the measures imposed by the Supreme Court and could motivate Jair Bolsonaro's request for arrest. However, the arrest should not occur due to the repercussion it would generate. It would have negatively reverberated as “persecution” and would also reinforce, in the far right discourse, the “judicial activism” on the part of the Supreme Court.
 </p>
<p>
  And an important addition on the case: journalist Túlio Amâncio reported that the Federal Police are studying the request for precautionary measures against the former president. Among them, the use of electronic anklet. The assessment is that it is not yet time for a pre -trial detention.

</p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  After just over a year of the SVM government, the political situation in Denmark has changed drastically. The government was planned and established at the end of 2022 after it became clear to the bourgeoisie that they could not continue their way of prevailing, as they did during it mistakenly called "Corona crisis". After Russian imperialism's war of aggression against Ukraine, many imperialist countries, especially in the West, began to accelerate their buildup. Denmark is not an exception, and from there came the necessity of the bourgeoisie of a centralized executive power to undergo militarization: the SVM government.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The government was founded on hypocrisy and lies from the start. The parties Left and the Moderates both went up for election as opposition parties to Mette Frederiksen and her tyranny and handling of the pandemic, but both ended up as her two lap dogs with prestige ministerial posts by each government party. The government did not waste time and steep abruptly abolishing big prayer day despite opposition, citizen proposals and public revolt to preserve it. Since then, the government has been responsible for the reactionutory of the bourgeois Danish state, with a centralization of the executive power of the power of power, a growing militarization of both police and military and a growing social chauvenism and imperialist aggression.
 </p>
<p>
  At the same time, the government has been discredited from day one and has become a historic government both because of its character as a majority government, but also by its low legitimacy towards the population-the SVM government has quickly become the most hated government for a long time.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The government has trumped both the permanent posting of Yankee troops in Denmark, along with the fact that more than 2% of GDP will now be used on the military. But at the same time, the government is currently losing its majority as up to several politicians such as Mads Fuglede has switched to the Danish Democrats and that the moderates have lost two mandates because they have become too obscene. Among other things. Has Jon Stephensen with his inappropriate messages to a 19-year-old youth partyer and 28-year-old Mike Fonseca with his grooming of a 15-year-old meant that the government has lost up to several mandates in the Folketing, which now threatens its character as a majority government. This is currently putting the government in a crisis where it must either reveal itself even more and enter into alliance with discredited figures or find other solutions.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At the same time, the SVM government and especially Mette Frederiksen have been discredited with their continued active support for Israel's genocide against the Palestinian people. This despite the change of their strategy from open condemnation of the Palestinian resistance struggle, to public silence, but continued support for Israel. What you can see from this is a government that is weakened and revealed to and hated by the people. The government is an expression of the deep crisis and decay of Danish imperialism and imperialism in general. Government has continued to reveal the democratic facade and bluf democracy in Denmark in the same way the former government did during the pandemic. At the same time, it shows how the people continue to fight and resist the government and that the abolition of Great Prayer Day, the Militaryization and the Bourgeisie's support for Israel reveals how the interests of the proletariat in Denmark are completely incompatible with imperialism.

  In recent days, several Russian imperialist state officers have blamed Ukraine and imperialist countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom for the recent Islamic State attack on Khorasan (EI-K) against a home of

  In Moscow, Crocus City Hall. Organizations and newspapers in the country say that the Putin regime will seek to use the attack to deepen the repression against the Russian people, while fascist groups can increase actions against immigrants and inhabitants of most Muslim regions such as Caucasus. Official pronouncements camouflage the true and possible origins of the attack by EI-K in Russia, such as the different wars of aggression made by Soviet social-imperialism and Russian imperialism against Arab countries and Muslim population.
 </p>
<p>
  The attack took place on March 22 and killed more than 130 people during a Picnic band show at Crocus City Hall, home -based events home. Shortly after the attack, EI-K issued a statement by which he claimed the authorship of the attack. Along with the text, a video was made available in which it showed four men performing the robbery, made with machine guns, grenades and cocktails

  History of aggression
 </h4>
<p>
  Despite attempts by the Russian imperialist state officers to annul the issue for their own purposes, there is no shortage of motivations for EI-K combatants to attack Moscow. The group, which operates in Tajiquistan, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Jammu and Caxemira, has accused the Russian state of "enemy" more than once, for different reasons. Among them are the invasion and annexation of the Russian imperialist state in Chechnya, a territory of a Muslim majority; The support of Putin to Bashar al-Assad regime, president of Syria (where the Islamic State acts against both the Russian Lacaio regime and against the US presence); And in more remote times, the war of aggression of social-imperialism Soviet to Afghanistan.
 </p>
<p>
  In addition, Russian imperialism nourishes a history of extensive crimes against the peoples of oppressed nations of a Muslim majority, such as sending Russian or mercenary troops to certain regions of Muslim population such as Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso and Sudan. Official justifications for troop sending are the fight against Islamic groups such as JNIM, but there are records of massacres and torture of the people by Russian troops and sagging by the Wagner group of African natural riches. A survey of the News Portal
  <a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/26/attack-of-the-isis-k-in-moscow-the-war-comes-back-to-the-russias-heart/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   The red herald
  </a>
  He also appointed the Russian intervention in the Tajiquistan Civil War and the dominion in Kazakhstan and Kyrguistan.
 </p>
<p>
  This is not the first time EI has performed an attack on Russian targets. In 2022, EI-K attacked the Russian embassy in Cabul, the capital of Afghanistan. In 2015, IS claimed the attack against an airplane from Egypt toward Russia. EI-K seeks, like JNim in Africa, to increase its influence on the regions that acts by reaching targets such as Russian imperialism, hated decades by local masses by successive wars of aggression and interventions.

  Putin regime manipulations
 </h4>
<p>
  Without touching any of these points, imperialist Putin gave the first statement about the case 19 hours after the attack. In it, it did not mention the pronouncement of EI-K. On March 26, Putin admitted the presence of “radical Islamists” behind the attack, but also pointed to collaborations from Ukraine. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was more striking, and stated in an article published in the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper that uses it was evoking the "bug-bug" of the Islamic State to cover its "wings" in Kiev. Already Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Russian Security Council, stated that "obviously it was Ukraine." Alexander Bortnikov, director of the Russian Federal Security Service, said "the terrorist attack on" Crocus "was prepared by Islamic radicals, but both western intelligence services and Ukrainian intelligence services were directly involved in him."
 </p>
<p>
  To this day, Russian imperialism has arrested eight suspects of participation in the attack. On Saturday, four were already in pre -trial detention. Three others were arrested on Monday. On March 26, another suspect was arrested. According to the Russian communication monopolies, two of the accused revealed that they participated in the attack. There is no information on the content of the testimonies of others. On March 25, four of the prisoners who were taken to court had clear marks of torture, among them bruises, swelling and the possible lack of an eye. One of the suspects was in a wheelchair.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Repression of democratic freedoms and 'nationalist and chauvinist order'
 </h4>
<p>
  Certain press agencies in Russia point to the Putin regime and the ruling classes seek to use the attack to “further limit citizens' freedoms and introduce new laws that prohibit any form of protest” and “imposing an increasingly chauvinist nationalist order on country, ”as the Russian newspaper said
  <em>
<a href="https://redherald.org/2024/03/26/russia-the-reaction-is-using-the-tragedy-at-crocus-city-hall-for-its-own-purposes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Serve the people
   </a>
</em>
  . The same newspaper mentions that Russian fascist groups may want to respond to attack with chauvinist aggressions and persecution against the Muslim population of regions such as Caucasus or Immigrants.
 </p>
<p>
  It is well known that, internally, Putin's regime also faces great popular resistance because of the wars of aggression it wages. Since launched the War of Aggression to Ukraine, there have been several laws approved to suppress the manifestations that pulled in the country to reject the invasion of the Ukrainian territory and to condemn the imperialist regime. Recruitment centers were even attacked with
  <em>
   Molotov
  </em>
  in some of the protest acts. Last week, during the election period, voting booths were also set on fire by protesters contrary to the regime.

 </p>
<p>
  José lived at Camp Wanderley Caixe, in Pedras de Fogo, which is about 34 kilometers from the municipality of Alhandra, where he organized a new camp.
 </p>
<p>
  The reasons for death have not yet been disclosed, but the notorious murder of the organizer of the peasant camp occurs in a scenario of sharpness of the land struggle in the country and increasing the crimes of landowners and gun against land struggle.

<p>
  A delegate and three investigators of the Amazonas Civil Police were arrested on March 24, along with six active military police (PMs) and a former PM under the flagrant of criminal association, kidnapping, extortion and other accusations. The case occurred in the municipality of Manacapuru, about 100km from the Amazonian capital.
 </p>
<p>
  The agents were identified as the delegate Ericson de Souza Tavares, head of the 6th Integrated Police District of Manaus, investigators Eliezio de Castro, Anderson de Almeida and Alessandro da Cruz, PMs Alexandro dos Santos, sergeant of the corporation, as well as the Cables Jozimo da Silva, Eldon de Souza, Ueslei Rodrigues, Kemer Pimentel, Edvaldo Pinto. Along with them, former police officer Germano da Luz Junior was also arrested.
 </p>
<p>
  The blatant came when, on March 24, the agents broke into the neighborhood of the current, in the municipality of Manacapuru, and kidnapped a man and a woman. The relatives of the victims then went to look at them at the police station, since the men presented themselves as police, and, with no record there, began a complaint that led to the arrest of the paramilitarians.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the ongoing investigations, the common practice of the agents was to kidnap and torture people involved with drug trafficking so that they could intercept the narcotics and thus sell them to other groups.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Paramilitaries kept an arsenal available
 </h4>
<p>
  Next to the paramilitarists were seized 22 porters, plus 17 firearms (some, with scraped numbering) and 207 varied ammunition. Nine mobile phones, three falsified cars, three vest covers, two ballistic vests, three holloves, balaclavas and handcuffs were also found.
 </p>
<p>
  The robustness of tampered equipment, as well as the discharge in the involvement of civil and military agents gives us an idea of how so organized are becoming the paramilitary groups formed by police in the state of Amazonas.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The number of cases of paramilitary involvement with repressive forces of the state grows
 </h4>
<p>
  In addition to the growing scandals involving police brutality, cases of torture or summary executions that have been increasing among operations and patrols, there is also a growing in the event of organization of police groups and former police for paramilitary functions in the region.
 </p>
<p>
  Only in the year 2023 is this the third case of involvement of these groups with drug trafficking. In January,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/am-oficiais-da-pm-sao-presos-por-desviarem-drogas-no-valor-de-r-6-milhoes/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   4 PMs of Manaus were arrested for deviation of about 250 kg of cocaine
  </a>
  . Already in February,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/am-9-pms-sao-presos-por-desvio-de-meia-tonelada-de-drogas/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
   Another 9 PMs, mostly associated with the Tactical Force, were caught diverting about 500 kg of drugs
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The criminal activities of these agents are not limited, however, only to drug trafficking, also having one of their main focuses on clandestine executions. Of these, the involvement of one of the figures of this case is key: former policeman Germano da Luz Junior.
 </p>
<p>
  Germano became known in the underworld of the extermination groups for his extensive record in these actions. The former PM who was recently sentenced to 11 years in prison for executing a uniformed colleague suspected of a loan scheme, is also known for his participation in the episode called Bloody Weekend in 2015 in Manaus, where the military murdered Cold blood 34 people.

  On March 24, the Remís Carla Women Group held a meeting with the residents of the Popular Condominium Esplanada celebrating March 8 (International Proletarian Women's Day). At the time, they denounced the neglect of years and years by the City of Guarulhos and previous administrations to maintain the place. After a storm in December 2023, blocks 6 and 13 were harshly affected by detachment and are suffering serious structural and sanitary risks. Residents also deal with lack of light and severe infiltration in the apartments.
 </p>
<p>
  The meeting debated the origin of the date, female oppression, and, within this, domestic work and class character of the “Women's Day”, truly international day of proletarian women, pointing out the differences between the conditions of exploiting women and those working women. There was also the popular struggle as a mandatory way to achieve their liberation.

<p>
  The residents of the Esplanada Condominium, in the neighborhood of Pimentas, took advantage of the event to bring punctual problems that afflict them and their families. The locality developed from 2012 with the relocation of people from other outskirts of the municipality, such as São João and Vila Any, and never received due maintenance. “They played us like an animal,” denounced a woman.
 </p>
<p>
  Size is the neglect that the documents of possession of the apartments were only made available last year and under the collection of R $ 155. Residents report coexistence problems caused by drugs and lack of leisure, as well as failures in the supply of water, energy, energy, and gas. It's been months that the blocks have been without light.

  In the project promised by then mayor Elói Pietá (PT at the time), it was guaranteed that the condominium fee would not be charged, which did not remain over time. Many residents boycott the collection in protest against the misuse of money. Most previous liquidators have committed screaming cases of corruption, such as selling apartments, stealing from cash, not reporting spending, and missing the payment of cleaning, maintenance, and ordinance. For this reason, there are processes in the name of the condominium that total more than R $ 200 thousand.
 </p>
<p>
  When a storm caused blocks 6 and 13, the last liquidator prohibited a report to report it, claiming that it was necessary not to give a breach to talk about labor proceedings. She also worked in the neighboring private condominium called Dunas, is related to a police officer, and barred the activities of the Popular Solidarity Student Committee (CESP), promoted by students of the Public College in front (Unifesp). The workers cherish the health and safety of the owners, stating “What if anyone dies? Will it import the process?

  In Guarulhos visited the house of one of the residents, which has suffered with severe effects of the infiltration that shakes its block. The walls are taken by the mold and moist to the touch, while the new gateway has been swollen and a metal piece on the stop causes electric shock on the routing. Several points of the ceiling have leaks fed by the puddles on the terrace. City agents have installed a canvas that cannot prevent their formation and feeds the proliferation of mosquitoes.
 </p>
<p>
  There is a fear of the respiratory problems that the mold causes, the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes (zika, chikungunya, and dengue), the terrace infested with leaks, and the structure of the buildings themselves, which together house 71 apartments. Other pending issues, especially the darkness in the stairs and the precariousness of other structures, can also cause major material damage and especially human if they continue unanswered.
 </p>
<p>
  The management of the situation is responsible for state health and civil defense agencies, but nothing has been done on their part so far. The residents discussed solutions and brought examples of the need to organize themselves collectively in order to give ideas and take action for the demands of the condominium. They also proposed a local administration with broad participation of the owners, so that their performance is democratic and efficient.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, it was decided to look for a specialist to make the structural report of the blocks and publicize a kitty to buy the reform materials. It is necessary to replace the roof and repair the infiltrations. Contributions can be transferred to the Pix key “

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We have often reported on the imperialist mega project of the Interocean Corridor on the isthmus of Tehuantepec. This is an industrial and logistics project that consists of a rail connection in the southern Landesge Mexico, which connects the Pacific and Atlantic and is to be used for goods transport. On the other hand, there are parallel to the rail connection, a federal road, ten industrial parks and a gas pipeline. The central component of the whole is that both the Atlantic Hall Coatzacoalcos and the Pacific Hall Salina Cruz are to be expanded to modern industrial ports with a multiplication of their current container capacities.
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/mexico-latifundiarios-e-pistoleiros-promovem-ataque-contra-camponeses-em-tehuantepec/,">
   This project centered around the rail connection is rounded off by a militarization of the entire area by the old Mexican state.
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Building on this, we particularly see the bureaucratic capitalism and semi -colonial character of Mexico and why imperialist mega projects such as the Interocean corridor are so exemplary for this.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Such a project like the Interocean corridor costs billions of dollars to finance everything. Part of it, more precisely $ 2.8 billion
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-American_Development_Bank#Member_state_comparison_table">
   are through the so -called Inter -American Development Bank (IDB)
  </a>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   But this is just a particularly obvious example of the semi -colonial character of suppressed nations such as Mexico. It becomes a little more difficult if you then look at the billion dollar investments that flow from Mexican hands into the imperialist mega project.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   The rail network of the Interocean Corridor is built by a subsidiary of the "Grupo Mexico". This subsidiary belongs to 74% of the "Grupo Mexico" and 26% to the US group "Union Pacific". The "Grupo Mexico" hereinafter referred to as "GM", but not only runs almost all rail networks in Mexico, but is primarily known for this to be the third largest copper producer in the world and to enter billions in profits. The Mexican Velasco family and its chief Larrera have over 66% of the majority of the multi -illium monopoly and are among the richest people in the world.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   This leads to the revisionist to the idea of leading the "GM" and the Velasco family as a prime example to "prove" that Mexico would be an imperialist country with its own large monopolies. And yet it is exactly the other way around, the "GM" is a real prime example of the development of bureaucratic capitalism through imperialism. In contrast to the allegations of the revisionists, the "GM" and its history are not an independent development of Mexican monopolies which make up part of an alleged Mexican imperialism, but about bureaucratic capitalism is developed by imperialism.
  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<a href="http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/grupo-mexico-s-a-de-c-v-history/">
    The story of "GM" does not start with Mexican capital, but begins with the American capitalist family Guggenheim in 1880.
   </a>
   At that time, the Guggenheims invested in mining and enamel operations in the USA. In 1889 Guggenheim persuaded Mexican mine owners to send their silver ores to his melt in the USA. The following year, the US Congress adopted high import duties for ores. Whereupon the Guggenheims in 1882 and 1885 only melt and then bought entire mines in Mexico. As early as 1901, the Guggenheim melts processed 40% of the lit and 20% of the silver which was mined in Mexico. A short time later, the Guggenheims bought a great participation in the Yankee mining conglomerate "Asarco". In the following decades, the Guggenheims bought or founded numerous mines and melting in Mexico and then put them under the control of this Yankee conglomerate. At the same time, millions of dollars also flowed into the development of technologies in the Guggenheim “Asarco” mines in Mexico. For example, for increased electricity production for more efficient minerals.
  </p>
<p p="" style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    In 1997, the "GM" founded a subsidiary together with the US company "Union Pacific" and leased the operating rights on the Mexican rail network from the Mexican government for 50 years. This lease agreement was financed by US capital, namely Wall Street loans. It was only in 1999 that the "GM" really became to what it was today when she bought her former parent company "Asarco" and thus also took over his business in the USA, Peru and other countries.

<p>
  Before giving the case Marielle closed, the Federal Police should clarify a key issue: who were the political mentors of the councilwoman's murder? Specifically, the PF should have summoned the army commanders of the time and deeply investigate the Bolsonaro family connection with the principals and executors. In addition to clarifying the existing incongruities from previous moments, when investigations were known, they suffered from obstructions. Without clarifying such points, it will be an illusion to think that the case is closed, that the principals were punished and that the power structure that commanded the political crime will not continue with the same acting that is typical to it.
 </p>
<p>
  The great conclusion of the PF report is that Ronnie Lessa met three times with the Brazão family (pointed out as the “home team”) in which she received the commission of murdering Marielle Franco. However, there is no concrete proof of these meetings. There is also no evidence of the Brazão family meeting with Rivaldo Barbosa, which is appointed as responsible for performing a “thorough planning”. The PF report merely approved Ronnie Lessa's STF and give the case as solved.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Facts not yet explained
 </h4>
<p>
  No one with a minimum of knowledge of the power structure in Rio de Janeiro doubt that Civil Police heads and Brazão strain deputies are involved in political crimes of this feat. However, it is not reasonable to accept that the real interested parties are not pointed out in the murder of Marielle Franco through a political attack that would have huge repercussions. Especially because a crime with
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/prisoes-dos-mandantes-da-execucao-marielle-nao-encerram-o-caso/">
   economic motivations would not be done in order to create a great commotion
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  PF gave up investigating the visit of Élcio de Queiroz on the day of the murder, to the Bolsonaro house in the Vivendas da Barra condominium, west of Rio de Janeiro. There is only one quote to the Bolsonaro family throughout the report, in order to state how Domingos Brazil was favored by the appointment to the State Court of Auditors.
 </p>
<p>
  The PF report also does not mention the role of Walter Braga Netto in the appointment of Rivaldo for the head of the Civil Police, even after the general received guidance from military intelligence discouraging the nomination. Report signed by Jefferson Miola, published in the digital magazine Jacobin Brazil, says that “the information circulates that the order to play Rivaldo Barbosa to control and manipulate the investigation
  <strong>
   came from a level above Braga Netto himself
  </strong>
  ”. Who was above Braga Netto?
 </p>
<p>
  To answer this, the PF would need to reassemble 2018 in Rio de Janeiro, when Army Commander Eduardo Villas-Bôas chose Walter Braga Netto as the federal intervener in Rio de Janeiro and Richard Nunes as Secretary of Public Security. Two years later, already in the general clamor for answers to the Marielle case, Walter Braga Netto stated that the resolution of the issue was "a matter of honor." According to journalist Humberto Trezzi, since 2020 the Army has “a database of the Civil and Military Police”, after Braga Netto won “from friends the reputation of having the CPF, name and address of each militia in Rio”. The commanders of the time should be summoned by the PF to provide clarifications about the episode. Or is this a matter whose full and complete clarification doesn't matter to the military?
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, as long as ideological and political mentors are not properly discovered, there is no basis for stating that the case was closed. Even less than the outcome of the case represented “a state victory over the crime” - as said the minister of government of Luiz Inacio.

  Today it has been reported by the Gaza Health Ministry, that 32,414 Palestinians have been killed, and 74,787 wounded in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza.

  The hypocritical air-drop-aid continues to kill instead of helping. While several children reportedly drowned while trying to get aid which landed in the Mediterranean, 18 Palestinians were directly killed due to a failed landing of aid.

  Meanwhile new information on the flour massacre has been
  <a href="https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6242/Report:-Israel-continues-to-violate-ICJ-ruling-on-Gaza">
   revealed
  </a>
  by Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor in Geneva: Targeting civilian gatherings around humanitarian aid trucks with direct gunshots, quad-copters, and Israeli tank shells is one of the most well-documented examples of the unlawful killings and executions carried out by the Israeli army against Palestinian civilians over the past few weeks. These incidents, which have become known as the “Flour Massacres”, resulted in the deaths of 563 citizens and the injury of 1,523 others. This figure includes civilians awaiting aid and workers in charge of planning, securing, and distributing aid.

<p>
  The world-wide actions in solidarity with the people of Palestine continues.
 </p>
<p>
  In the
  <strong>
   US
  </strong>
  , activists have blockaded access points into a Kent weapons factory by lying across the road and locking themselves to gates. The factory, a subsidiary of Israeli drone manufacturer Elbit Systems, produces a range of weaponry and military equipment which is used in the ongoing genocide.

   reported
  </a>
  that Comrades attended the March 9th national march where over 400,000 people from all different backgrounds expressed great enthusiasm in denouncing the genocidal Israeli State. In the midst of this powerful mass demonstration, comrades engaged in mass work, speaking to the enraged masses from all walks of life, from men to women and religious to atheist to discuss the present Israeli assault on Palestine. Leaflets (Pictured above) were distributed to people whilst comrades engaged in conversation with them and they were received overwhelmingly positively. The need for a democratic, secular one State solution and the necessity for a united front against the Israeli fascist war machine was discussed thoroughly.

  In Glasgow a demonstration on the 10
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March showed the unwavering anti-imperialist spirit of the local people and their continued will to stand against the Israeli genocide which is being backed by the British Imperialist ruling class. Comrades in attendance noted the various advanced anti-imperialist lines expressed by the masses in their chants and discussions, linking the Palestinian struggle to the wider anti-imperialist struggle in places such as Yemen and Iraq. The marchers were also quick to reject the notions of “condemning both sides” and a “peaceful, two-state solution”, as pushed by the Imperialists and their supporters, who aim to contain and subdue the growing anti-imperialist movement and prevent it from unifying around a strong, revolutionary line.

  that on Friday, the 22
  <sup>
   nd
  </sup>
  of March, a demonstration “against genocide and occupation – freedom for Palestine” was organized in Bochum,
  <strong>
   Germany
  </strong>
  . A Speech by the Red League focused primarily on the question of the support of the National Resistance Front of Palestine against the genocide and the role of the imperialists, especially US imperialism. It spoke about different important questions that are relevant to the anti-imperialist and Palestine-solidarity movement in the FRG and, above all, made it clear the need for uncompromising anti-imperialism.

  The MLPD did not participate, because it had explicitly been forbidden by the Open Palestine Meeting, to bear flags of bourgeois parties. So they left the demonstration, since apparently their bourgeois respect was violated, since nobody wanted to distance themselves from the national resistance struggle.
 </p>
<p>
  The demonstration reached its end in front of the Bochum town hall. On the route that led there, a flag of the Palestinian resistance, including the Red League logo, had already been hoisted across the main street during the day. It caused a lot of a stir and blocked traffic.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, a greeting from the comrades of the United Campaign for the Liberation of Georges Abdallah from France, which had sent a greeting to the demonstration in a great manner to show proletarian internationalism, was read out.

<p>
  The most important aspect of the march in Bochum was to consolidate a consistently anti-imperialist point of view among the participating forces. In the question of whether you are on the side of the oppressors or oppressed, there is no middle and those who represented this experienced a clear slap.

  On the 24
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of March it was the 25
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  anniversary of the NATO-bombing of Yugoslavia. The consequences of the bloody attack against the sovereignty of the peoples of the Balkan continue to this day. The military alliance bombed for 78 days and nights, between 12,000 and 15,000 people were killed in this. Until this day the Austrian capital makes profit out of the war of Yugoslavia.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   NATO-bombs to “advance peace”?
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The war of Yugoslavia caused a deep split among the peoples of the Balkan. The aggression of NATO was carried out under the pretext of “advancing peace”. The “peace” established after the war meant from the beginning a territory occupied by the UN-troops named KFOR (Kosovo Force). These troops are a military formation under the leadership of the NATO. The KFOR-troops are formed by 28 States and comprise as of January 2024 of 4,443 soldiers. Also Austria sent until now regularly around 500 soldiers. From April a third of the company will retreat from Kosovo in order for it to be possible to set Austrian soldiers for the EU-combat troops. Not only was this always breaking the neutrality, but also the basis for making the Balkan-countries economically useful for the Austrian capital was created from the start.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   The “independent”
  </strong>
<strong>
   R
  </strong>
<strong>
   epublic
  </strong>
<strong>
   of
  </strong>
<strong>
   Kosovo
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In February 2008 the “independent Republic of Kosovo” was proclaimed. Still, Kosovo is led by the EU-council through a rule of law mission (EULEX Kosovo). This mission is supposed to support the construction of the Kosovar republic in the rule of law and the maintaining of the public order. With this a medium to secure the interests of the EU-imperialists in the Balkan was created. With the institutions of flimsy “peacekeeping” the efforts for the eastern expansion of the EU were secured. It cannot be called an “independent” republic if the State is led by an international military commission and there is permanent NATO-support bases in the country. This is clear proof of that the imperialists are not in the country for supporting peace but to secure their influence and their power.
 </p>
<p>
<a>
</a>
<strong>
   The mood of the population of the Balkan
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Even today the consequences of the Yugoslavia war are palpable. Still today also the ruling class of Austria make profit out of this war. Mass unemployment, corruption, bad living conditions are also today partly consequences of this war. The peoples on the Balkan protest since decades against corruption, against police repression, against the NATO-support bases and also against the efforts for joining the EU. In Croatia, as a EU-member State, the population also suffers from the introduction of the Euro.
 </p>
<p>
  In commemoration of the victims of the NATO-attack the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of the Balkan against the foreign rule must be supported and defended also by Austrian anti-imperialist forces.

   We are at a critical juncture for the student movement after the passage of the Pierrakakis law on the establishment of private universities. For two and a half months we have experienced great student mobilizations, a political struggle for central confrontation with the government and the aspirations of the system. The student world nationwide, again met his clubs, demonstrated, occupied, walked the path of the struggles, questioned the dominant policy. Two and a half months full of hope, but also political conclusions. Students in their fights were able to shake the whole political system, hoping to walk the dismantling of acquired rights, the prospect of children in the most populist classes studying in front of him, found the accumulated rage of a youth who felt this youth. The system does not fit her and her dreams.
  </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
   The response from the part of the government was immediate. Repression and terrorism, from the lost semesters and examinations, to the violence of the police and arrests, prove that they are afraid of us, that our struggles scare them. The blackmail and indirect repression were obviously not missing with the use of tele -education, which hit the masses of occupations and demonstrations. In this difficult environment, students were invited to continue their struggles, to answer.
  </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
   In Xanthi in particular, against a year of decomposition of the student club, we were again full of amphitheater, which exceeded 700 people. Continuous mass general meetings, with decisions on occupations and demonstrations in the city. We broke the stillness, we made it known in our city that there is the youth that resists. We stood by the strikers on February 28, we responded to the effort to impose a club on the club.
  </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
   Despite the perseverance of the students, all this time, we see that after the law is passed, occupations are ends nationwide, stop being called upon general assemblies, the sense of returning to "regularity" is created. For us, student struggles do not end or turn out to the vote. Student betting now must be one: Continuing the struggle to overthrow the law. The student movement is able to overturn voted laws, and has done so in the past (see Law 815), it can do it again. We must not rest. They do not fit in with illusions. The direction of "not implementing" the law is deadlocked and compromise. Laws are voted on to apply. It is the direction of defeat, the direction of throwing our hopes on the teaching establishment that will allegedly block its application, or in their judges that they will make the law unconstitutional. It is imperative that the struggle to overthrow the law.
  </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br/>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
   In fact, questions and concerns arise in terms of the continuity, the perspective and the legacy left by the student movement.
  </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br/>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
   We invite all students to an open, wide discussion, how to overthrow Pierrakakis law, the need for the continuation of the struggle and the victorious direction within the movement.

  Approximately 100 farmers organized by the Poor Peasant Association Jaqueira (Pernambuco) from various communities took back their wells, which had been fenced by a large farm company.
  <span id="more-5006">
</span>
</p>
<p align="justify">
  March 18, about 100 LCP holders in Jaqueira, Pernambuco (PE) communities (Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabugi, Monteir, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa d'Andua, Tenório and Sítio Grande) combined their forces A large farm company Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A, owned by the farm of the farm Guilherme Maranhão.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Since 2015, when the robbery of countries and wells began, the peasants have lived and produced the former Frei Caneca farm on land. Former Governor, Maranhão, supported by former governor Paulo Camara, made the gun groups threaten the entire population to expand cattle breeding to international exports through the Masterbory of the slaughterhouse.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Despite comprehensive evidence of water poisoning with the pest of the water (in addition to the contamination of cattle stool), the Pernambuco Public Ministry (MPPE) and the Pernambuco Environmental Secretariat (CPRH) never began any criminal investigation company Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Thus, at the People's Assembly, the peasants decided to implement a large act to take the wells back from the large farm. The invitation reached the entire local population in flying markets and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts to clean and isolated the wells, 50 meters from the Large Lord's livestock farms and eucalyptus plantations.

  To do all this work, the status advocates dropped José Ricardo's revolutionary area of peasants and young students in the Mangue Vermelho movement. They helped to clear the bushes and mark the fences to protect the wells in the scorching sun. More, they met alongside the rest of the people, fighting the provocations of the gentlemen.

  As soon as the peasants had completed their joint effort with the first well in the first well of the day, singing folk songs and shouting slogans, half -time rifle from large farms appeared with tractors, stage farms, motorcycles and quads. The gunmen arrived with the posts, thread and eucalyptus seeds to put them in the same area that the peasants had just cleared. When the peasant march faced bands, representatives of the farmland began to threaten the peasants with firearms. The voltage led to a confrontation, three guns were injured, and the droon of the big farm was destroyed by the furious folk of firearms.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  This same March 18: A MPPE agricultural promoter, CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee to monitor agrarian conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the pasture commission (CPT) and Pernambuco workers and peasant federation (Fetape) perhaps A large farming company Agropecuária from Mata Sul S/A visited to study complaints of the peasants made by the farm. According to this information, this Commission did not visit the peasant wells, but only to the places shown in the farm.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  However, the powerful action of the peasants forced the entire Commission to introduce the act at the scene of the Aktio and to approve two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Folk Alliance (Abrapo) and the Commission of the Barro Branco Farm Association, and also had to accept the urgent conditions of the people in the public.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Eventually, Mppe approved the proposal of the peasants represented by Abrapo to create a "water corridor" to separate the wells of the people. The status of the farm was ordered to pay the poles and the thread, the city administration sends employees and it was the responsibility of the State Environmental Department to investigate people's waters to determine pollution and to open a criminal investigation against the farm.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  After hearing the court, Guilherme Maranhão's gunmen asked for reinforcements from the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to plant eucalyptus for one of the wells that the peasants had been cleaned in cooperation, and Eduardo Figueredo, a lawyer of farm lords, declared that they would complete the military
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  Two vehicles were sent to bring security to the gunmen to continue their anti -folk action. This is not a courage to show, but rather a cowardice in front of a small display of peasants connected and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how dedicated the military forces of this old state are about protecting the interests of the state of space and promoting the poverty of the poor in the country and in the city.
 </p>
<p align="justify">
  The peasants occupying the former Frei Caneca status are determined to take back all their wells and their land from the hands of the farm. In this way, they invite all peasants in the southern forest area of the Pernambuco to rise against the gunfire groups of large farms and the armed forces of this old state. Without destruction, large farms can never be entitled to the poor of the rural rural.

  We publish the pictures sent to us by our readers. The photos were taken of posters and stickers in the city of Valkekoski, near Tampere. Valkeakoski is an industrial city that has traditionally been strong supporting the labor movement, which is reflected, for example, in the events of the 1918 Finnish Workers' Revolution. At that time, hundreds of the best boys and daughters in the city's working class were murdered by white bays.

  After Friday at the Cabi-Cattaneo, death factory of death and part of the Italian industrial military apparatus where the production of weapons was denounced to kill the proletarians, but also the internal repression of the government of the Meloni-Crosecto warfarer- and the Palestinian resistance in Italy. The response of the proletarians and workers as you can see in the video that stand up to applaud with the strength smile is very significant.

  Denunciation that was brought to the mobilizations of Saturday 23 in Milan to which a new square was added to Treviglio, with a garrison that shaken the Arab community with a beautiful popular participation that launched a mass demonstration for April 13.
 </p>
<p>
  Here too a good climate as seen in the photos and in the very applauded intervention to reiterate that the Palestinian resistance is not terrorism, the only terrorism is that of the Nazi-subsidiary state of Israel and all the accomplices, all the imperialist countries included The Italian government.

   In Colombia, there are much who since their trade as actors, directors and playwrights have been restless, worried and dedicated to telling the stories suffered by the people. Some have been able to see plays as an act of memory about events that have marked the history of the people. Colombia has many plays about forced displacement, the war against the people at the hands of landowners and armed groups; And, in recent years, special works have been seen in the Colombian theater about the disappearance of the children of the people in the so -called "false positives."
  </p>
<p>
   For those creators, we extend a greeting on World Theater Day, and we greet all the artists of the performing arts that in one way or another dedicate their knowledge and experience to fight the battle against the oppressors, from the field of culture. This day, it is also a recognition of the dedicated work, sacrificed and patient that is done, even under precarious conditions in which the state of the capitalists more than culture more, to dedicate the treasury to the rescue of the bourgeoisie and from the war.
  </p>
<p>
   On this March 27, 2024, when shadow times are lived, it is necessary to remember the words expressed by the German author Bertolt Brecht on the occasion of the
   <strong>
    II International Congress of Writers in Defense of Culture held in Valencia Spain in 1937
   </strong>
   :
  </p>
<p>
<em>
    If culture is something inseparable from the general productivity of the peoples, if the same violent intervention can deprive the peoples of butter and sonnet, if in effect culture is something so material, what should be done then in favor of your defense?
   </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
    What can she do? Can you beat? Be hit, then you can. The fight has its different phases. The different cultural producers oppose only only impulsively to the terrible events in their country. But already the designation of barbarity as a barbarity means: beat. Then they join against barbarity, what is necessary to do to beat. They pass from the protest to the appeal, of the regret to the call of struggle. Not only do they indicate with the fingers towards criminal action, but they call criminals by name and demand their punishment. They realize that the condemnation of oppression has to end with the extermination of the oppressors, that the compassion with the victims of violence must become rejection against the aggressors, the compassion in rage and the aversion against violence in violence. To the violence of the privileged class, violence, full and destroying violence of the people must be opposed
   </em>
   .
  </p>
<p>
   That these words of the German playwright serve to call the artists of the town, who with difficulties travel schools, squares, villages, theaters ... through all corners of the country to make the decision to beat with their people in the struggle that is nearby To resurgence. To those who also suffer in flesh live social and economic violence, those who feel with enormous passion in their bowels the pain of the people, we call them to also consider the importance from their trade contributing to the preparation and organization of the popular assemblies .
  </p>
<p>
   That their texts, their actions and their dramatic and comic words continue talking about the memory of the people, of the tragedies that should not be forgotten and cannot continue to live, but also speak of the victories, to take lesson of the facts that They serve to continue beating against oppressors. That he speaks of his power and strength as producers of all the wealth, that he is able to talk about his defects, those unique defects of the proletariat against which he must fight to continue moving forward. That speaks of the most important task of unity and struggle independently to face all oppressors; How to truly exercise popular power directly in popular assemblies.
  </p>
<p>
   And, although they are a lot of authors who through history have put their art at the service of the revolution, we share with you a fragment of the work "The days of the commune", by Bertolt Brecht. In this particular scene we witness how the Parisian people were learning during the commune of 1781 to exercise direct democracy, to make the most revolutionary decisions that the people need. The scene ends with a beautiful song: "Or all or none", which summarizes the great discussion that was fought in this scene and that if we saw it live up the spirits upload to the revolutionary struggle; A song that perfectly complements the slogan that extended on the walls of the streets in Colombia since 28th of 2021:
   <em>
    Only the people save the people
   </em>

  The Datafolha Institute yesterday released a survey on the image of the Federal Supreme Court. Its result pointed to a technical draw among those who evaluate positively and negatively. In the historical series, the positive assessment never exceeded 31%, while the negative evaluation has already reached 38%.
 </p>
<p>
  In March 2024, 40% of respondents evaluate the STF's work as “regular”. And while there is a drop in the group that evaluates the Supreme Court is “bad” or “bad” (from 38% in December 2023 to 28% in the latest survey), only 29% of respondents judge as “great” or “good ”. The survey also confirmed that among Bolsonaro supporters there are more critics of the Supreme Court when compared to Luiz Inacio's.
 </p>
<p>
  The advance of investigations into the institutional rupture plan by former President Jair Bolsonaro and some military personnel, so was not enough to positively modify the perception of respondents regarding the role of the country's Supreme Court. The explanations for this necessarily go through the phenomenon of the crisis of legitimacy of all political institutions in the country. As an institution of the old basic state, the Supreme Court tends to distance itself more and more from the interests of the people. It is necessary to recognize that the large performance of the Supreme Court in order to investigate and punish those involved in the coup plots is not able to ensure democratic freedoms. And it is possible to prove how the population tends to evaluate the court from a quick look in its latest actions.
 </p>
<p>
  On March 21, 2024, the ministers overthrew the “revision of the whole life” of retirees. On October 26, 2023,
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/stf-decide-que-bancos-podem-tomar-imoveis-de-devedores-sem-decisao-judicial/">
   decided that banks can take real estate
  </a>
  (even without judicial decision) in case of late payment of the financing. On November 29, 2023, a thesis proposed by Alexandre de Moraes was approved that the indemnity was allowed to be charged and the removal of content from press vehicles in the event of liar information publication. If in appearance the thesis goes by
  <em>
   “combate a fake news
  </em>
  ”The text leaves no doubt about how comprehensive and vague criteria - especially the use of an inaccurate criterion such as“ offenses ”,“ honor ”,“ moral ”, etc. -They are used to constitute another instrument that, joining the others, will be
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/sionistas-da-conib-pedem-prisao-do-jornalista-breno-altman-em-nova-tentativa-de-censura/">
   used against freedom of the press and expression
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The Supreme Court also expresses its vision and political interests through its inaction. When
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/organizacoes-denunciam-prisao-de-jovens-em-sp-sob-lei-dos-crimes-contra-o-estado-democratico-de-direito/">
   Nine young people were arrested during a demonstration and indicted for “criminal organization”, “corruption of minors” and “attempted abolition of the Democratic Rule of Law”
  </a>
  , there was not one minister to make a statement - even though
  <em>
   in off
  </em>
  - For no communication monopoly in the country.
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/stf-decide-que-bancos-podem-tomar-imoveis-de-devedores-sem-decisao-judicial/">
   murder a musician and a 257 -shot cans
  </a>
  stated that it was a “misunderstood error”, advocating the use of the infamous legal provision
  <em>
   unlawful
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In the actions and silences of the STF ministers is expressed the essence of their class position, therefore. They do not want to avoid a coup d'état or eliminate the conditions of institutional crisis that engenders the far right; Yes, they seek to better accommodate in the power structure in force through disputes with the far right and demarcations/negotiations with the military right. It is false that only Bolsonarist fanatics are right to criticize the Supreme Court. It is a mistake to leave to the far right the priority in the criticism of this oligarchic and anti-povo institution.

<p>
  The espionage network that was structured by former President Jair Bolsonaro from the Israeli program “
  <em>
   First Mile
  </em>
  ”It was used to spy on Augusto Heleno. The Federal Police investigation has come to information that a mobile number used by Heleno for work issues was consulted eleven times, according to journalist Renata Agostini of the press monopoly O Globo.
 </p>
<p>
  The mobile number was not in the name of the former minister of the Institutional Security Office, which indicates that it was someone very close to Augusto Heleno who used the information to spy it. There are suspicions that Jair Bolsonaro was suspicious of nearby allies, including Heleno.
 </p>
<p>
  Reserve general and decades with military coup, Augusto Heleno was responsible for an attempt to appease a major crisis from Jair Bolsonaro's government. That was when former Minister Sérgio Moro delivered office accusing Bolsonaro of interference with the PF. Heleno then met with Moro to discourage him to leave the government, to no avail. Jair Bolsonaro complained about the scarcity of strategic information, which also falls on the former GSI minister, responsible for intelligence.
 </p>
<p>
  With each new revelation of the “parallel abin” it is found that the structure was operated by the far right indiscriminately. In the transition from Jair Bolsonaro's government to Luiz Inacio, the GSI moved to the hands of a “trusted man” of the current president, who contradictorily maintaining Bolsonarists at major ABIN posts. It is necessary to clarify whether the Israeli application spy is still used by Bolsonarists kept at Abin. To date, the total list of the numbers spied on the “parallel” were not available, although there are suspicions that more than 10,000 numbers were targeted. The General Court of the Union (CGU) should open, in the coming days, disciplinary administrative proceedings against the servers involved in the scheme.
 </p>
<p>
  What is known is that the use of the program “
  <em>
   First Mile
  </em>
  ”It should be restricted to a single individual, appointed by Abin (whose control is within GSI's own attributions). In fact, the program was operated by numerous allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro. It was through the remote access of other devices that these pockets constantly accessed the program and delivered dossiers to Carlos Bolsonaro. This has all ever bothered either Augustus Heleno, nor to the military commanders (ultimately responsible for the spy and intelligence apparatus in the country).
 </p>
<p>
  However, if neither Augusto Heleno nor the military have bothered, the Luiz Inacio government has reasons to bother and investigate the issue.
 </p>
<p>
  Appointed by the president, the current director general of ABIN, Luiz Fernando Corrêa, keeps in positions Chaves
  <a href="https://www.intercept.com.br/2024/02/03/lula-precisa-largar-essa-tara-de-dormir-com-o-inimigo-e-demitir-ja-o-diretor-geral-da-abin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   known pockets
  </a>
  . He has already met Alexandre Ramagem, who is regarded as one of those responsible for the “parallel Abin” and was recently the target of a PF operation that found $ 172,000 in kind. An ABIN computer was found in this same operation, which also had targets Carlos Bolsonaro (pointed out as the political coordinator of ABIN parallel). The following questions must be clearly answered: the computer found in
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/operacao-da-pf-contra-familia-bolsonaro-apreende-computador-da-abin/">
   operation of 01/29/2024 against the “abin political core”
  </a>
  Did you have access to sensitive information? The Israeli application “
  <em>
   First Mile
  </em>
  Is it still used by Abin? What do the pockets do who still remain in the structure of federal government intelligence? It will be no good to make use of half a dozen bureaucratic measures to remove from the position of a few involved in the tramos if the fundamental issues are not resolved. It is in the hands of Luiz Inacio to find answers to this.

  It is strange to hear from the Minister of Justice of the Government of Shift, Ricardo Lewandowsky, that the Marielle case is closed without a plausible motivation. That the Brazão family and former Civil Police chief, Rivaldo Barbosa, are involved, no one doubts. But it is stupid to think that Marielle was executed in downtown Rio de Janeiro in 2018, amid military intervention, for voting against a bill that was approved for the benefit of the cariocas mafias (poorly called “militias”). The execution, done in a spatious way to the fashion of the far right, sending a clear message to the left and with the objective of destabilizing the political situation, has no identity with the motivation presented for crime as the conclusion of the PF survey.
 </p>
<p>
  Bolsonaro clan with Élcio de Queiroz and Ronnie Lessa, driver and executor of shots on March 14, 2018, are known. On Marielle's execution day, Élcio de Queiroz was in the Bolsonaro condominium and is in the book of visits his name and apartment 58, whose owner is Jair Bolsonaro. Why did the minister of Luiz Inácio ignore this fact, reported in 2019 by the condominium doorman? Ronnie Lessa received from Bolsonaro a prosthesis when she lost her leg in an attack in 2009. Why does Lessa say she doesn't know Bolsonaro?
 </p>
<p>
  Adriano da Nobrega, another involved in the case, was killed in 2020 when he began to be investigated for involvement in the Marielle Franco case. There are many telephone conversations, intercepted by the investigators, in which Adriano mentions "Jair" and "president", and even says that "fucks herself for being friends with the president." What is the relationship of Adriano and Bolsonaro? He was killed when the investigation started to have it as a target, and Adriano's wife says it was “file burning” in a coordinated police operation between PM Carioca and Bahia. Who Adriano could incriminate that at that time had power to coordinate a national police operation to execute it? Finally, the former Civil Police chief was appointed one day before Marielle's execution during the military intervention in Rio de Janeiro, by order of intervener Braga Netto, even though he received warnings that Rivaldo was not reliable. Why did the investigation out of this fact?

<p>
  Perhaps the receipt, Bolsonaro took refuge for two days at the Embassy of Hungary, a country ruled by one of the world's far-right heads and a friend of Capetão, when Marielle's investigations rapidly passed on to prisons. Bolsonaro is afraid of? Although it is true, besides this reason there is no shortage of others: there is accusations, inquiries and processes of various crimes committed by him who could lead him to prison.

  Admittedly, the Bolsonaro clan has some kind of relationship, to some degree, with the murder of Marielle Franco. She was not killed for voting against a bill, nor the Brazão would be stupid to the point of attracting to themselves all the attention of their criminal businesses, with a spailed political murder,
  <em>
   just because
  </em>
  They were confronted in a vote, where even the vote of the councilwoman had been decisive. The motivation presented by the PF resembles a fake track that pointed to certain "militias", as did the Civil Police in 2018, when he had accused another militia who was already reclusive and fulfilling a 25 -year conviction - Orlando Oliveira Araújo “Curicica” - as principal of the attack against Marielle; At the time, Orlando rejected the accusation, for which there was no proof to present.

   The investigations, unlike the unfortunate speech of Luiz Inacio's minister, are not completed - at least, not from the scientific point of view and the truth. There is much to deepen if you want to prove the real motivation of the crime. But judging by the conduct of the minister and Luiz Inácio, irreducibly committed to the policy of appeasement with the militics, the purpose of these is even to bury the subject.
