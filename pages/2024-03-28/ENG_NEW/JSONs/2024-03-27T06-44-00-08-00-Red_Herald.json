In the midst of this powerful mass demonstration, comrades engaged in mass work, speaking to the enraged masses from all walks of life, from men to women and religious to atheist to discuss the present Israeli assault on Palestine. Leaflets (Pictured above) were distributed to people whilst comrades engaged in conversation with them and they were received overwhelmingly positively. The need for a democratic, secular one State solution and the necessity for a united front against the Israeli fascist war machine was discussed thoroughly.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10306\" data-id=\"10306\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/leaflet_digitalexport_front-722x1024.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/leaflet_digitalexport_front-722x1024.webp\" width=\"722\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10305\" data-id=\"10305\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a5backexport-722x1024.png\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a5backexport-722x1024.png\" width=\"722\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">\n   Distributed Leaflets.

Comrades in attendance noted the various advanced anti-imperialist lines expressed by the masses in their chants and discussions, linking the Palestinian struggle to the wider anti-imperialist struggle in places such as Yemen and Iraq. The marchers were also quick to reject the notions of \u201ccondemning both sides\u201d and a \u201cpeaceful, two-state solution\u201d, as pushed by the Imperialists and their supporters, who aim to contain and subdue the growing anti-imperialist movement and prevent it from unifying around a strong, revolutionary line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/t-brd/8395-nrw-demonstrationen-zu-palaestina-in-bochum-und-essen\">\n   Reports serve the people\n  </a>\n  that on Friday, the 22\n  <sup>\n   nd\n  </sup>\n  of March, a demonstration \u201cagainst genocide and occupation \u2013 freedom for Palestine\u201d was organized in Bochum,\n  <strong>\n   Germany\n  </strong>\n  . A Speech by the Red League focused primarily on the question of the support of the National Resistance Front of Palestine against the genocide and the role of the imperialists, especially US imperialism.
