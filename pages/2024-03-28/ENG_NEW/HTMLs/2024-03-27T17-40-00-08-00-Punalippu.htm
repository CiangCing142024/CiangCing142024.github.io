  Approximately 100 farmers organized by the Poor Peasant Association Jaqueira (Pernambuco) from various communities took back their wells, which had been fenced by a large farm company.

 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  March 18, about 100 LCP holders in Jaqueira, Pernambuco (PE) communities (Barro Branco, Furnas, Cabugi, Monteir, Caiana, Morcego, Caixa d'Andua, Tenório and Sítio Grande) combined their forces A large farm company Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A, owned by the farm of the farm Guilherme Maranhão.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Since 2015, when the robbery of countries and wells began, the peasants have lived and produced the former Frei Caneca farm on land. Former Governor, Maranhão, supported by former governor Paulo Camara, made the gun groups threaten the entire population to expand cattle breeding to international exports through the Masterbory of the slaughterhouse.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Despite comprehensive evidence of water poisoning with the pest of the water (in addition to the contamination of cattle stool), the Pernambuco Public Ministry (MPPE) and the Pernambuco Environmental Secretariat (CPRH) never began any criminal investigation company Agropecuária Mata Sul S/A.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Thus, at the People's Assembly, the peasants decided to implement a large act to take the wells back from the large farm. The invitation reached the entire local population in flying markets and in all peasant communities affected by this environmental crime and against the health of the people. The peasants also organized joint efforts to clean and isolated the wells, 50 meters from the Large Lord's livestock farms and eucalyptus plantations.

  To do all this work, the status advocates dropped José Ricardo's revolutionary area of peasants and young students in the Mangue Vermelho movement. They helped to clear the bushes and mark the fences to protect the wells in the scorching sun. More, they met alongside the rest of the people, fighting the provocations of the gentlemen.

  As soon as the peasants had completed their joint effort with the first well in the first well of the day, singing folk songs and shouting slogans, half -time rifle from large farms appeared with tractors, stage farms, motorcycles and quads. The gunmen arrived with the posts, thread and eucalyptus seeds to put them in the same area that the peasants had just cleared. When the peasant march faced bands, representatives of the farmland began to threaten the peasants with firearms. The voltage led to a confrontation, three guns were injured, and the droon of the big farm was destroyed by the furious folk of firearms.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  This same March 18: A MPPE agricultural promoter, CPRH agents, representatives of the State Committee to monitor agrarian conflicts (CEACA), representatives of the pasture commission (CPT) and Pernambuco workers and peasant federation (Fetape) perhaps A large farming company Agropecuária from Mata Sul S/A visited to study complaints of the peasants made by the farm. According to this information, this Commission did not visit the peasant wells, but only to the places shown in the farm.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  However, the powerful action of the peasants forced the entire Commission to introduce the act at the scene of the Aktio and to approve two lawyers of the Brazilian Association of Folk Alliance (Abrapo) and the Commission of the Barro Branco Farm Association, and also had to accept the urgent conditions of the people in the public.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Eventually, Mppe approved the proposal of the peasants represented by Abrapo to create a "water corridor" to separate the wells of the people. The status of the farm was ordered to pay the poles and the thread, the city administration sends employees and it was the responsibility of the State Environmental Department to investigate people's waters to determine pollution and to open a criminal investigation against the farm.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  After hearing the court, Guilherme Maranhão's gunmen asked for reinforcements from the Pernambuco Military Police (PM-PE) to plant eucalyptus for one of the wells that the peasants had been cleaned in cooperation, and Eduardo Figueredo, a lawyer of farm lords, declared that they would complete the military
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  Two vehicles were sent to bring security to the gunmen to continue their anti -folk action. This is not a courage to show, but rather a cowardice in front of a small display of peasants connected and organized by the agrarian revolution. It also demonstrates how dedicated the military forces of this old state are about protecting the interests of the state of space and promoting the poverty of the poor in the country and in the city.
 </p>
 <p align="justify">
  The peasants occupying the former Frei Caneca status are determined to take back all their wells and their land from the hands of the farm. In this way, they invite all peasants in the southern forest area of the Pernambuco to rise against the gunfire groups of large farms and the armed forces of this old state. Without destruction, large farms can never be entitled to the poor of the rural rural.
