   48 years after the last most cruel dictatorship of our history we said was genocide. Today more than ever we raise the flags of the never above all at this time and this context of adjustment, repression, delivery and sufferings for the Argentine people. The Milei -Villarruel government denies that it was a genocide and claims the genocides. That is why we raise our voices to say: No to the impunity of yesterday and today, 30,000 detainees -disappeared present, memory, truth and justice.
