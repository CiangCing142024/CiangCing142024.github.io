  and companies active in the war supply chain, today also in Genoa - such as 
 In many other cities - the protest of the students and of 
  Some professors:

  , some precarious workers who have signed the appeal to the Rector

   Federico Delfino

  Protest started at dawn with a
  <b>
   presidio
  </b>
  in the atrium of the rectorate, in via Balbi 5, with banners, banquets and 
 an exhibition on the history of the conflict in the Middle East, but then it is overlooked 
 in a real
  <b>
   Empress of an autonomous group of students
  </b>
  in the room that housed the meeting of the
  <b>
   Academic senate
  </b>
  , then interrupted. First, for hours, the same students had protested out of the door screaming slogans like
  <b>
   "Outside NATO from the University"
  </b>
  , playing drums and reading the motivations of the garrison with the megaphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  boys and girls, on the other hand, have
  <b>
   contested
  </b>
  openly the
  <b>
   rector
  </b>
  Federico Delfino both during the Senate and before, during a short
  <b>
   meeting within his office
  </b>
  . 
  On this occasion Delfino was apostrophized with insults of the type 
 "Genocida, murderer" because, not wanting to agree to suspend the 
 Agreements under accusation, has been defined as an accomplice of those who carry out i 
 bombings on Gaza.

  <b>
   No step back
  </b>
  Compared to the death agreements, no dialogue with the students ", they declare to change course.

 <p>
  “In the closure of the comparison - they conclude - he then exploited the mobilization to do
  <b>
   pass the narrative of the contrast between "good and democratic" students and "bad and violent" students

  (carefully avoiding talking about the numerous teachers present) for 
 Divide us: we respect these accusations, the academic community to the sender
