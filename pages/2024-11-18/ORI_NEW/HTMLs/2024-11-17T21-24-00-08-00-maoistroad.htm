     We publish some excerpts of an unofficial translation of an interview with Mestre Joelson by A
     <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/entrevista-e-urgente-uma-alianca-de-classes-contra-o-latifundio-liberalismo-e-o-capitalismo/">
      Nova Demcoracia
     </a>
     .
 Mestre Joelson is the coordinator of Teia dos Povos, which according to
 him is a “gathering of communities, territories, peoples and political 
organizations, from rural and urban areas”, which wants to form a 
“struggle alliance independent from electoral politics and State 
institutions”. Joelson is a historic leader of the struggle in Brazil 
and a resident of Bahia, of the Terra Vista settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Joelson starts talking about the first years of Terra Vista 
Settlement, which at first, in 1992 was led by MST and it occupied the 
land where cacao was harvest, which was 70% of Bahia’s GDP, by 
latifundium. But all plants were killed by a fungus and that left 25.000
 families impoverished. So then the families retook the land and founded
 Terra Vista settlement. It was later, in 1997 and 1998 when a new wave 
of mobilizations arose in the movements for struggle for land in Bahia. 
Now, as AND states, there are still important attacks against the 
peasants in the area, the most outstanding is the Mãe Bernadette 
Revolutionary Area, organized by the League of Poor Peasants (LCP), 
carried out the self-demarcation of their lands in a “People’s Court”, 
facing and defeating armed bands by the latifundium.
    </p>
    <p>
     Joelson also states on the character of the struggle for land:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Look, it’s not new that the State, the State apparatus, is at the 
service of the latifundia. That comes from Colonial Brazil. The State is
 a legal arm, an armed arm to contain the struggle for land. Because the
 struggle for land is the struggle for power. Whoever has land and 
territory has power. Those who don’t have it, don’t have power. And we 
have to understand that the struggle for land is also an anti-capitalist
 struggle. If it doesn’t have these characteristics, struggling against 
the government and against capital, it has no meaning. Because 
capitalism is no longer reformable. There is no longer any condition for
 reforms. So it’s a struggle against capital”, stated Joelson.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to that, he also speaks on how the social movements 
awaited for the PT government to solve the land problem with the 
agrarian reform, which never came. “This is an anti-capitalist struggle,
 an antagonistic struggle, in which latifundium has to die, agribusiness
 has to die, so that the landless peasants can survive. So there is no 
possible agreement in this struggle.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He states clearly that Invasão Zero is part of the armed groups of 
the latifundium, which take advantage of the non organization of the 
social movements: “When movements come together, prepare the struggle 
and face Invasão Zero, this group disappears. So it is the inability of 
social movements to organize themselves to face Brazil’s greatest enemy,
 Brazil’s oldest enemy, which is the latifundium (…)”. The peasant ended
 stating: “A class alliance against latifundium, liberalism and 
capitalism is urgent. And not to carry out agrarian reform, as that no 
longer fits”.

     Similarly, as the conclusions of a

      b
     </a>
     y LCP:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Our struggle is just, our cause is sacred! We call on the peasants 
to build armed self-defense organizations in the struggle for land in 
the same proportion and caliber as the latifundium does! We call on the 
peasant leaders who did not bend the knee, the squatter leaders, the 
indigenous peoples, the Quilombola organizations, the populations 
affected by dams, mining and eucalyptus plantations, the proletarian 
masses and other workers in the city, who are increasingly struggling in
 defense of their trampled rights, to close ranks with our brave 
peasantry, on the path of the Agrarian Revolution.”
