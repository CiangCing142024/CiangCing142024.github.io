 <p>
  Comrades,
 </p>
 <p>
  The CC of the CPI (Maoist) firstly conveys revolutionary greetings to
the people of the areas of revolutionary movement for boycotting the
elections to the Loksabha on the call of the Party.
The BJP made a conspiratorial plan in the leadership of Modi-Amit
Shah-Mohan Bhagavat to gain majority in the elections and to transform the
country into a Hindu theocratic state and thus facilitate the way for the
exploitation of the imperialists, comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and big
landlords without stop. The Constitution needs to be changed basically so as
to establish a Hindu theocratic state that divides the people on the basis of
religion. For the purpose, it needs to gain three fourths i.e., 403 of the total
543 seats. Thus came forth its slogan ‘Ab Ki baar-400 par’. In a Hindu state,
the discrimination towards religious minorities in education, employment,
legislative bodies, judiciary and other such spheres would become
Constitutional. A majoritarian state or an apartheid state will be formed
where Muslims and Christians will not have equal rights and Hindus alone
will have powers on all the spheres. BJP entered the arena well prepared to
win the election with this evil plan. Majority of the opposition parties
formed into an alliance in the name of INDIA and entered the arena.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let us
evaluate the situation after elections and formulate the necessary tasks for
the revolutionary movement.
In our country that the ruling exploitive classes boast to be ‘the
biggest democracy’ of the world, elections were held as a farce to the 18th
Loksabha and the Assemblies in Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Odisha and
Arunachal Pradesh from April 19th to June 1st. Let us see how the elections
took place. The Election commission permitted to spend Rs. 25,000 per
candidate for the election in 1952 that rose to 95 lakhs by now. This is 380
times more. However the limit applies only for the candidate but not the
party he belongs to. EC assessed the expenditure of all the parties in this
election at Rs. 1,42,000 crores. It amounts to Rs.1400 per vote. Every ruling
party gave ticket to the rich alone. According to the Association for
Democracy Reforms (ADR), 8360 candidates participated in the election out
of whom 1644 have a criminal history. 251 of the newly elected have a
criminal history. Five percent of the candidates have assets above one
hundred crores. 541 are very rich. These elections once again clearly
showed how costly ‘democracy’ is in our country and that ordinary people
cannot stand or win in the election and why genuine democracy lacks.
If we see the trend of the elections – selling and buying of votes
became an affair of public market. Misappropriation was in the rule. The EC
seized Rs. 11,000 crores in this election. This is three times more than the
amount of Rs. 3,477 crores see in 2019. In spite of the hype for voting made
by the EC, the ruling parties, the NGOs and the media, polling was at a mere
65.79 percent in 2024 when compared to 67.4 percent in 2019. The percentage of polling gradually decreased phase by phase. Above 35 crore
people did not vote. In the semi-colonial, semi-feudal country where
Parliamentary democracy has no meaning, people in the many areas of the
country who are unable to understand the alternative to solve their
problems are choosing boycott of election as a weapon.
The number of voters is above 97 crores in the general election.
Votes polled were 64.2 crores including invalid and NOTA ones. Out of this
polling BJP got 36.6 percentage of votes (23 crores), whereas its alliance got
7 percent votes (4.5 crore). The vote share of NDA-BJP was mere 43.6
3
percent (27.5 crore votes). According to the ECI declared data the total
polled votes were 64.2 crores, but the alliance under the leadership of BJP
got only 27.5 crore votes. This reveals that this is the minority vote and
failed to get the confidence of majority people and unfit to form the
government. But this alliance with the majority of seats in the parliament
came in to power shows how fake is this democracy! Apart from BJP got
how many seats and votes, the real danger of the people- RSS-BJP could not
be defeated without resisting it in all fronts by the people to save the
country and themselves.
As mentioned earlier, the objective of BJP in this election is to
trample all the civil and democratic rights of the people of the states,
nationalities and the indigenous tribes in the name of ‘new India’ and
‘developed India’; to formulate brutal civil and criminal codes worse than
during the colonial rule, to formulate Acts that change the fundamental
essence of the Indian Constitution and wipe out the nominal, democratic,
federal system in the country; to get hold of by hook or crook the Legislative
bodies, the police, Para-military and other departments, education, health
and other sectors, the manifestos of religious and cultural organizations and
all voluntary organizations and those of Non-Resident Indians; and to fill
them with Hindutva forces; thus structuralize Brahmanic Hindutva
corporate-military rule. BJP felt it can do all these if it comes to power the
third time. Most of the imperialist countries, the domestic and foreign
corporate companies and feudal forces of the country supported it to serve
their interests. These classes have been encouraging Brahmanic Hindutva
Fascism for the past few years in their economic and political interests.
 </p>
 <p>
  The RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishat and BJP brought into force all its
machinery in the country and all over the world into propaganda to support
its majoritarianism and majoritarian rule in the past ten years. The entire
government machinery was in support of it. The propaganda was such that Modi alone was competing in each constituency, in the name of Modi
guarantee. In the midst of this propaganda the BJP left its own party
election manifesto and took up hate and false propaganda against the
manifest of the opposition INDIA out of fear of defeat.
4
The EC responsible for free and fair elections without hate
propaganda acted against it. The Modi government appointed new
commissioners with the history of being pro-BJP to EC just two days before
announcing the election schedule. The Supreme Court was silent towards
this move while it was a violation of its judgment. The EC rejected to take
action on the hate speech of Modi. It played a pro-BJP and anti-opposition
role all through the process of elections. It took a dual policy. The Modi
clique utilized it as an instrument with a prior plan.
 </p>
 <p>
  INDIA alliance declared saving Indian Constitution and protecting
democracy as their objectives. But they were not organized. There were
several contradictions and disunity in the alliance. People did not have
strong belief in it. All these helped the Modi clique.
 </p>
 <p>
  In spite of any number of conspiracies of the Modi clique and any
amount of efforts of INDIA, no party gained majority. The divisive politics of
the BJP and the anti-incumbency feeling like in Andhra Pradesh gave
relatively more votes for the NDA alliance. Even though, BJP gained 240
seats and NDA gained 293. INDIA gained 234 and others 16. Therefore, BJP
stepped down and had to form the government together with its NDA allies
on simple majority. This is an indication of the utter discontent among the
people towards the exploitive policies of the ruling classes, the corruption
and misappropriation of the leaders and the contradictions among the ption
and misappropriation of the leaders and the contradictions among the
ruling classes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The anti-people policies implemented by the earlier governments in
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and at the same time the machinations of RSSBJP, use of money power and misuse of State machinery led RSS-BJP to
come in the power independently in Odisha and an alliance in Andhra
Pradesh. In Arunachal Pradesh BJP was able to retain its power with its
machination tactics, money power and misuse of State machinery. In Sikkim,
due to anti-incumbency Sikkim Democratic Front lost the election and
Sikkim Krantikari Morcha won the election. Due to the anti-people policies
of every bourgeoisie political party, no party are having guarantee to come
back to power again after five years. That's why people are unable to
understand the real alternative and they are finding no option other than to
5
choose any one of the exploitative ruling parties. When the people
consolidate with the practice of the revolutionary party and immerse in the
call given by it, then the people will find real alternative.

   <span style="">
    The anti-people policies of BJP led to its .failure to achieve its
target
   </span>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p>
  Majority people opposed the Hindu majoritarian ideology, the
bureaucratic attitude basing on brute majority and its Brahmanic Hindutva
Fascist rule. People protested the massacres and the bureaucratic rule in
Manipur and Kashmir. Although the Modi clique instigated religious sentiments through the building of Ram mandir, it didn’t work on the
workers, peasants, middle classes, small and medium traders and producers
who had several problems and that of unemployment on the whole. CAA
brought forth few days before the elections also did not achieve the
expected results. Most of the Dalit people suffering from untouchability,
mob lynching, human scavenging and other such problems voted against
Modi in this election. We also see that the government employees does not
vote to BJP this time. The repressive policies of the government towards
women who faced patriarchal suppression, atrocities and murders out of
prestige and towards the tribal people who fought for jal-jungle-zameen
against corporatisation and militarization can be said to be strong reasons
that led to the failure of BJP to achieve its target. Several You Tubers
exposed and questioned the policies of the Modi government that had
more effect on voters.
 </p>
 <p>
  BJP could not achieve its sinister objective of crossing 400 seats due
to the opposition of the people to the Modi's rule and the consequence of
their anti-government vote. It utterly failed to gain even simple majority.
Especially people of Tamilnadu, Punjab, Kerala and West Bengal rejected
Hindutva politics. People of Mone, Toonsang, Lengleng, Kifir, Nomatur and
Sheklak of Nagaland boycotted elections on the call of the Eastern Nagaland
People’s Organization in protest to the negligence of the Modi government
towards the demand for separate state of Frontier Nagaland. People of the
areas of strong revolutionary movement boycotted elections on the call of
the Party in the direction of eestablishing an alternate genuine New Democratic politics and organs of political power. People of areas of
nationality liberation movement and anti-displacement struggles mostly
boycotted elections in protest to the anti-people and repressive policies of
the central and the state governments. People of few villages in UP, Bihar
and Tamilnadu boycotted elections in protest to lack of minimum facilities.
All the candidates who were in the election battle field are exploitive
thieves and the people did not find alternative, so many voters pressed the
NOTA (None Of The Above) button.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hiding these facts the NDA is trying to deceive the people with its
Goebbels propaganda that there was an all-round development in Modi’s
rule, that is the reason the people elected a strong government, that this is
a historic people’s judgment, that they would continue to work for the allround development of the people, that Modi has a clear vision towards
developed India and that he has a big role in gaining respect for India and in
the elimination of poverty. In fact the election results show that people
judged against Modi and BJP and that this is a big political and moral blow
to Modi.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Modi clique over dependent on Modi with over confident, it looked down the activists of RSS with arrogancy, Nadda stated that there is
no need of RSS for the BJP's election campaign now, few seniors who were
thought to be coming in the Modi's way and few juniors in the name of lack
proper experience kept aside in the BJP. Those who jumped from other
parties were given much priority and those of the other parties opposed for
a long time by the BJP were accepted into BJP and given tickets. All these
led to discontent among the opposition cliques in RSS and BJP. The number
of votes for BJP were lesser in 135 seats when compared to the earlier
election. It even failed to win the seat in Ayodhya. RSS Sir Sangh Chaalak
Mohan Bhagavat himself openly commented on over confidence and ego of
BJP.
 </p>
 <p>
  Modi aggressively implemented the agenda of RSS. He had its
support and that of Adani and Ambani. This gradually increased ego and
over confidence in the Modi clique and it came to be bureaucratic. The evil
force of Modi clique and its bureaucracy rose and strengthened out of the
7
hegemony of the RSS in any part of the country, the countless massacres
and atrocities it unleashed, the bureaucratic rule and rise in Hindu
communal hate ideology, politics and culture.
