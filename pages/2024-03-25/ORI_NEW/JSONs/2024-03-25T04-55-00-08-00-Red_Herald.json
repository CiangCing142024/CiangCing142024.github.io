The paramilitary gang handcuffed and beat the workers and handed them over to police officers who were waiting in a soy-bean area, with several vehicles and even a helicopter. The peasants thought they would be arrested, but they suffered another session of physical aggression, this time by the police; only one peasant was taken into custody.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The helicopter, probably the same one that operates in the Machadinho region, since March 5th, was linked to the Federal Police, as you can see in the video:\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-video\">\n  <video controls=\"\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MACHADINHO-VID-20240306-WA0204.mp4\">\n  </video>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Peasant representatives suspect that one of the perpetrators of this crime is the landlord \u201cIvo da Ip\u00ea\u201d, who claims to be the owner of the Ip\u00ea farm.
