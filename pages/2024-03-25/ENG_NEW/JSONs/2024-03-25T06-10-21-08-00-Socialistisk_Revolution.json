Lenin emphasized this well, he said: \"Equality for the law is one thing, to guarantee equality between men and women, and equality for life is another thing\" and he said the problem is that women should fight for their own liberation , and they can only do that within the release of the proletariat, there is no other way to do it.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   People's Woman Movement\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   <span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">\n    Declaration of principles\n   </span>\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  With the advent of classes marking the beginning of exploitation, the oppressive burden of women also began; From slave to Livegen, from Livegen to Works. To this day, when there are exploiters, women are suppressed and this situation can only cease when the class basis for oppression falls at the root.\n </p>\n <p>\n  From yesterday's women's slavery to today's formal equality, centuries of silent and persistent struggle or mass violence has fought conquests in total battles. Society develops in the middle of the class struggle and is promoted by the masses in battle.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The progress of women has been and is the progress of the people. But they have not been passive recipients, they have been sister fighters and decisive advocates for the oppressed's case and militants in the front line; People's trenches everywhere also carry the indelible traces of their blood. Women are not, as it is said, apolitical and indifferent; Women, especially women of the people, are revolutionary warriors.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The daughters of the oppressed classes, workers, peasants and workers have given glorious names that adorn the releasing deeds of the masses: Rosa Luxemburg and Liu Ju-Lan are examples of the international revolutionary struggle and in our city Micaela Bastidas.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Women are not just passive beings, not just banal ornaments of the home, not just apolitical instruments; Class -conscious women are tireless fighters and decisive activists.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Peruvian women have also been and are popular fighters, and as part of our people they have fought with them throughout our history; The women's battle in our country has its synthesis: Micaela Bastidas.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Women today suffer from oppression and exploitation, and it has a cause: the semi -colonial and semi -feudal situation in our country; A situation that weighs as mountains of our people and which doubles its weight on the female masses in Peru.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In this society where the masses rise to imperialism and feudalism, women take their place in the fight and emit their clear cries of war to join our people's roaring cries. The Peruvian women's struggle is part of the oppressed and exploited people's struggle, and their enemies are the same. Their common struggles and their invincible and necessary final success will also be the same triumphant and liberating success.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The Peruvian women have never stopped fighting, but the present requires a wider and deeper participation on their part.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Today, when the ruling classes elaborate on capitalism dependent on imperialism in the country; where they use anti -democratic and top -controlled perceptions to organize the masses with corporativist forms that deny the principle of class struggle; Today, when mobilization and organizing women are encouraged outside the popular struggle and in favor of the ruling classes, the People's Women's Movement De Ayacucho resumes its fighting march and throws themselves, with a clear awareness of the situation in our country, in the struggle for class mobilization of Per\u00favian Women in the Service of the National Democratic Revolution.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This task will be performed in accordance with essential principles:\n </p>\n <p>\n  - It is only possible to play a consistent and firm revolutionary role in following the invincible light of Mari\u00e1tegui's thought.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - The masses free themselves and we must serve them by making them aware of their creative role in history.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - In our country, the plenty we need to approach, mainly the workers and the peasants, and we must always orient ourselves to the poorest and most exploited.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - To mobilize and organize, it is necessary to investigate and propaganda; That is, knowing the concrete problems of the masses and developing revolutionary agitation and propaganda among them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - It is necessary to organize in all the forms that the proletariat has created and developed. Women must join all of them.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Women can only organize themselves properly if they do so on the basis of a class principle of grouping women based on their class position.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Without a clear and just political consciousness, there is no soul, that is, conscious and firm to follow the laws of the struggle of the people in our homeland.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - To take the basic and primary need of step by step, through the struggle, to raise the political consciousness, to base the majority's most concrete needs and problems and to raise them politically.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - The revolutionary struggle can only succeed by uniting all oppressed people and classes, but the most important thing is to rely on its own efforts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  - Under these principles, and in order to fulfill the goal of class mobilization of Peruvian women, People's Woman Movement De Ayacucho makes an effort, perseverance and struggle to unite with other similar movements, to create and develop the People's Movement de Nuestra Patria as a movement created by the proletariat In the female masses, with three characteristics: 1) Compliance with Mari\u00e1tegui's thoughts; 2) As a class organization of the masses, and 3) subject to democratic centralism.\n </p>\n <p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\n  1976\n </p>\n <p>\n  People's Woman Movement\n </p>\n <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   Turkey\n  </strong>\n </h2>\n <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n  <strong>\n   5 years in prison for 75-year-old woman who defended her land\n  </strong>\n </h3>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Featured_Hatice-Kocalars.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Featured_Hatice-Kocalars.webp\"/>\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n   <em>\n    Hatice husbands.

Blacksmith Kawa's rebellion against the cruel Dehaq is not only an assertion of justice, but also an expression of historical consciousness that represents the truth. What gave the spirit of Newroz, which is part of the millennial story of the fight between the oppressor and the oppressed, and its symbol, the fire, was the righteousness and righteousness of the oppressed to the oppressors. Newroz is a fire of the rebellion for those who are right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Newroz is an awakening, a resurrection and an awareness of one's chains. Newroz is undoubtedly a party for those attempted to slaves, assimilated if culture was destroyed and whose language was banned by the Turkish rulers because of their national identity. It is a struggle for awakening, resistance and liberation from all this oppression of the Kurdish nation, which has been tried to be kept under national oppression. This struggle for liberation was attempted to be suppressed by the fascist dictatorship of massacres, devastation, prohibition and denials. Newroz was banned by fascism, just as it is also forbidden to be Kurds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But today it has once again been proven that the unfair and cruel cannot achieve their goals against the righteous. Newroz was also written into the story such as Mazlum Do\u011fan's slogan of not surrendering by transforming his body into a fireball against the order that \"the fate of the Kurds is slavery\", under the most contemptible torture. The fire of the rebellion, which flared up again, grew irrevocably in the mountains and cities under the leadership of the Kurdish national movement. While the guerrilla stepped up the rebellion with the awareness that \"salvation is coming from the end of the barrel,\" the Kurdish people turned with the risk of mass massacres, Newroz into a resistance day with Serh\u0131ldans (\n  <em>\n   red. \u2013\n  </em>\n  Words referring to the Kurdish rebellions against national oppression from the ancient Turkish state).\n </p>\n <p>\n  Newroz is no longer just a public holiday or a party for the people in the Middle East, but also the fire of uninterrupted battle built by those who oppose historical injustice with their historical resistance. Newroz has become a celebration of oppressed people, beliefs and nations to challenge injustice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The imperialist-capitalist system and its servants attack the oppressed people and nations of using their war machines and all the oppression. As the conflict between imperialists is sharpened, regional wars become more common, chauvinism escalates around the world, and hostilities between nations are nourished. Palestine and the Kurdish nations are exposed to devastating attacks from Zionism and fascism, the servants of imperialism, for the freedom they require. The imperialist system and its lacquer are performing constant and strong attacks that burden the people with the economic crisis they are experiencing.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   More struggle is needed against fascism, stronger organizations and a stronger unity of revolutionary forces. But it is not possible to go back and defeat fascism through electoral tours, parliaments, municipalities and the now very limited legal fieldwork. It is crucial to make seats, streets and all areas of battlefields against fascism and to create stronger organizations. The fascist dictatorship appears armed from head to toe with a power apparatus. The fight for power against power, with weapons against weapons, is crucial.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    The rides in Newroz\n   </strong>\n   are the armed, organized rebellion.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Newroz\n   </strong>\n   is a call to break the chains to be saved.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Newroz\n   </strong>\n   is about dealing with the fight with a revolutionary spirit, not with a liberal spirit.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Newroz\n   </strong>\n   is an invitation to organize to win the future and to expand the fight with guerrilla games, which is the carotid wire of the People's War.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    -Happy New Year!\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    \u2013\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Light\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    The fire of the Newroz uprising!\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    \u2013\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Light\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    our\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    P\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Arti TKP/ML, head of\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    JUST NOW\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    and TMLGB!\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\n   <strong>\n    Marts 2024\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-right\">\n   <strong>\n    Take/ml -

Rather, it seems that the units of the old Indian state as soon as they open a warehouse are in a defensive and defensive spiral, and if the warehouse is left, the risk of running and falling the geriljas should be immediately.\n   <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caf-jawan-killed-ied-blast-chhattisgarh-9181558/\">\n    And a spokesman for the device also confirmed in an interview that bechapal\n   </a>\n   <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caf-jawan-killed-ied-blast-chhattisgarh-9181558/\">\n    Politi\n   </a>\n   <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caf-jawan-killed-ied-blast-chhattisgarh-9181558/\">\n    Wagon\n   </a>\n   <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/caf-jawan-killed-ied-blast-chhattisgarh-9181558/\">\n    that has been around for a year continuously suffering from the surrounding explosive devices placed by Maoist\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In Bijapur and Chhattisgarh, the people of India and Chhattisgarh, who have been in helplessness in their own country, on the one hand can be the first of the many basic principles of the revolution, especially in the Bijapur region, to ensure that they are capable of To make the most of their own resources to achieve this new goal. On the other hand, the ancient Indian state does not appear to be able to protect its counter -revolutionary armed forces and maintain the offensive nature of the actual mission.

Sanjoy Deepak Rao, a progressive intellectual from Jammu and Kashmir, has already been arrested several times for his activism. Last September, he was arrested again in Telangana, this time accused of being the leader of the Communist Party of India (Maoists), a party leading a folk war against the ancient Indian state.\n     <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2023/09/28/india-alleged-important-maoist-cadre-sanjoy-rao-arrested/\">\n      There have been reports in the past\n     </a>\n     about his arrest.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     The accusation includes violations of the Indian Criminal Code in several of its paragraphs, but in particular several paragraphs in the Prevention of Illegal Activities (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA)) are included, especially section 17, 18, 18-B, 20, 38, 39 and 40. This notorious law has been characterized as 'draconic' of\n     <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/how-terrorism-law-india-used-to-silence-modis-critics\">\n      Media all over the world\n     </a>\n     and\n     <a href=\"https://thewire.in/rights/uapa-anti-terrorism-laws\">\n      especially of the progressive Indian media\n     </a>\n     . Among other alleged materials that, according to the repressive powers, would strain him, Sanjoy Deepak Rao's accessories, such as the laptop and alleged literature related to Maoism, are said to be confiscated, as is usual in raids during UAPA. Rao was on his way to medical treatment when he was arrested and IKP (Maoists) has declared that Rao was mistakenly related to the party.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Numerous activists and organizations for democratic rights have on many occasions condemned the abuse and oppression of the ancient Indian state, which, among other things, oppressive mechanisms use UAPA to imprison those who disagree with the policy of the Indian ruling and imperialism in India. Among those who condemn this use of UAPA is campaign against state oppression (\n     <a href=\"https://redherald.org/tag/casr/\">\n      CASR\n     </a>\n     ) and forum against corporation and militarization (\n     <a href=\"https://redherald.org/tag/facam/\">\n      FACAM\n     </a>\n     ) from which we have reproduced and translated many statements and press releases.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Between 2015 and 2020\n     <a href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/news/972-uapa-accused-jailed-long-periods-and-eventually-acquitted-study-finds-168494\">\n      have more than 8,000 people been prosecuted using UAPA\n     </a>\n     , and 97.2 percent of them have been imprisoned for a long time and eventually acquitted. It is very common for these charges to be without evidence and this law acts as a threat and punishment against activists from all over the country. They are usually labeled as Maoists, even though they are only activists of democratic rights, against oppression or in defense of oppressed parts of the population. It was\n     <a href=\"https://redherald.org/2024/03/06/india-a-court-acquits-professor-saibaba/\">\n      the case of Professor Saibaba, who was recently acquitted\n     </a>\n     and released after being accused without evidence, which was recognized by the Indian courts.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     What many media hides is that UAPA is not an invention of the government led by Modi and BJP, but that it is a repressive tool for the Indian ruling classes and imperialism that became\n     <a href=\"https://thewire.in/rights/uapa-anti-terrorism-laws\">\n      introduced in 1967\n     </a>\n     , as there was an intense popular fight against the old Indian state. Since this year, the changing governments of the ancient Indian state have had the opportunity to ban and pursue organizations and associations under UAPA's section 3 without the need for evidence, judgments or other possible defense on the part of the oppressed. Since this year, progressive media has condemned that there has been a serious attack on democratic rights and freedoms, and in recent years the Indian government has used a tool it already had.\n    </p>\n    <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      The old Indian state is unable to control manipur\n     </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     <strong>\n      12. marts\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n     <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/featured-manipur.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/featured-manipur.webp\"/>\n     <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n      <br/>\n      <em>\n       Cars damaged due to shot exchange in imphal.

The attack was carried out by about 200 armed persons. Manipur's Police Commanders refused to exercise their functions that day, showing the total crisis in the area of the oppressive forces.

Subsequently, it has been pointed out that joint operations between several oppression forces are carried out intensely, but local oppression forces are asking for more central efforts.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     This will undoubtedly lead to the reactionary and local ruling classes to use a harsher repressive policy against the people of manipur and against any protest that will be labeled as a criminal or violent. Attorneys and activists in Manipur actually indict that this is already happening, for example with the exaggerated\n     <a href=\"https://www.imphaltimes.com/news/lawyers-condemn-security-forces-excess-inside-chierap-court-complex-staged-sit-in-protest/\">\n      power that rapid action strength uses\n     </a>\n     Against the frequent and peaceful women's protests taking place in manipur. All of this is nothing but the result of the sharp crisis of the local ruling classes, and due to the explosiveness of the masses, materialized in the major protests that have shaken manipur since May 2023. And these protests have not been pacified at all, on the contrary they continue week after week, month after month, showing the weakness and reactionary character of the old Indian state.\n    </p>\n    <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      CASR: March 18 - Public Meeting on Political Prisoners and Unmistakous Prison\n     </strong>\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n     <strong>\n      18. marts\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n     <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CASR_18March.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CASR_18March.webp\"/>\n    </figure>\n    <p>\n     <em>\n      We hereby publish an unofficial translation of the following press release from the campaign against state oppression (CASR).\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      <u>\n       Press release\n      </u>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n     <strong>\n      Campaign against state oppression (CASR) press conference and public meeting on political prisoners and wrongful imprisonment of Hem Mishra, GN Saibaba, Pandu Narote Prashant Rahi, Mahesh and Vijay Tirki\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     On March 18, 2024, campaign against state oppression (CASR), a common platform for more than 35 organizations, the International Solidarity Day with political prisoners by holding a public gathering and press conference entitled \"Life in Anda Cell: Political prisoners and wrong prisons \u00abIn India's press club, Delhi.

Revolutionary and progressive Filipino women deserve recognition as they carefully and zealously live women's important role in the struggle for national liberation and democracy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     CNL marches with the proletariat Filipino women who militant are against any attempt by Marcos JR to further neoliberal policies that established and now worsen, the stunted and backyard economy in the country. Today, foreign capitalists and local Comprador Bourgeoisie are a race with each other in ownership and control of our rich resources and the exploitation of our worn masses for super profit.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     The population also rejects the conflict between Marcos and Duterte Cliques and ultimately exposes the obvious evil adultery to the two of their imperialists: the US and China and for large local landlords and the Comprador Bourgeoisie. This is bureaucracy capitalism at the core. Filipino women are also at the forefront of defending people's dignity and rights against all forms of discrimination and violence, especially fascism and state terrorism.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     In today's memorial day of international working women's match day, CNL is proud of the 12-point program for the national democratic front in the Philippines, as the most concrete program that maintains women's welfare. It offers a program that will pave the way for an alternative life that every Filipino woman strives to have. A life of food security through true agricultural reform, financial security in an independent and self -reliant economy through national industrialization and welfare by maintaining and promoting people's democratic rights and dignity as it promotes the revolutionary emancipation of women in all areas. The prolonged People's War draws the weeds of oppression of the roots. Thus, awakening, organizing and mobilization of women composing half of the population and the majority of the working class is one of the most important tasks of the national democratic revolution.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     We greet the many Filipino female revolutionaries who pursue the highest form of resistance in the country's battlefield through armed battle. They point their rifles to people's oppressors, care for society with revolutionary doctrine and mobilize the masses to defend and protect themselves. In our history and practice, the revolutionary movement recognizes and treats women's rights and capacity for men. The revolutionary movement also rejects all forms of discrimination and underestimation of women's ability. We very much appreciate the potential and active contribution of women and LGBTQ+ to promote the Philippine Revolution.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     We acknowledge that women, in addition to class of oppression, are also bound by cultural oppression and patriarchy. CNL therefore confirms that it is only through the National Democratic Revolution with a socialist perspective that women's life and shalom of women could be pursued. We praise the victories won by the militants and revolutionary Filipino women, as these victories are great and sustained contributions to achieving lasting national liberation and democracy. Likewise, NDR's victory is a relief for all Filipino women.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Live Filipino workers!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Live women!

The 1973 Constitution or the Marcos Constitution that replaced the constitutions before World War II made President Ferdinand Marcos SR a Enmann's ruler. The Constitution, as Marcos implemented, made him a dictator and let him remain in power further through the declaration of combat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     The Filipino People's Anti-Dictatorship match led to the eject of Marcos in 1986, paving the way for the Corazon Aquino government and its constitution of 1987, which included some favorable provisions such as the ban on nuclear and foreign military bases, limiting foreign ownership to 40 %, antipolitical dynasty and time limits for elected officials, including the president. These provisions had been the subject of many dishonest attempts from previous puppet regimes to change them.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Marcos Jr and his allies in his ruling class fraction are behind the movements to revise the Constitution of 1987. He aims to think of this piece of paper with changes that will fascinate his family and crises once again in eternity while ensuring the support of the US Imperialism by allowing the latter and its allies to plunder our resources and end the annexation of the Philippine archipelago as its military base in the threatening interimperialist shooting war with China.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     The oppressed and exploited classes and sectors in the Philippine community all have the reasons to oppose Marcos' Charter Change. Landsman-NDF believes that people's opposition to charter change is growing and will succeed as it is attached and bred to the anti-imperialist, anti-bureaucrat capitalist and anti-fascist struggle.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     We urge the Philippine people to postpone and oppose the Marcos regime as the new tyrann of American Imperialism at the helm of the puppet government in the Philippines. Any changes to the current 1987 constitution of the Republic of Philippines are only aiming to consolidate and perpetuate the power of the ruling classes of bourgeois incomes, large landlords and the bureaucracy-capitalist state and favors the continued looting and belligerent agenda of its US imperialist champion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     No change in the current neocolonial constitution will provide relief or salvation to the Philippine masses from poverty, fate and oppression.
