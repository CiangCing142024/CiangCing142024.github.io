The anti -populist policy of the government and the system was overall, and the path of organized struggle was promoted. The response of the world was quite positive, which has been found in other interventions lately. There are clear indications of the depth and breadth of the attack that touches wide social strata and the concerns and pursuits that develop within these strata.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <i>\n   Following is the notice shared:\n  </i>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   To live we have to fight !!\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  ;\n  <b>\n   Health Minister A.

The so -called national diploma. Laws must work,\n  <b>\n   49 Student arrests and asylum violations in Thessaloniki, but also ongoing disciplinary and criminal prosecution of teachers because they simply exercised their trade unions ...\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u00b7\n  <b>\n   And the \"blind\" justice, the oil is pudding the pediatrician\n  </b>\n  (with backs in government and church)\n  <b>\n   acting in conjunction with the so -called Inquiry Committee on Tempi Crime\n  </b>\n  , which in its findings are again killing the 57 victims, to acquit its system and governments, which do not give a damn about the life of the people and youth.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u00b7 Where they give - no dime - but dozens of billions are in war equipment, F35s and frigates, which send them to the Red Sea at the behest of their bosses and the EU.\n  <b>\n   Thus participating in the crime of Zionists and the US, who massively slaughtered by the Palestinian people, condemn the death of thousands of children, carry out a Nazi genocide and have turned the Gaza Strip into a \"skull place\" !!\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <b>\n   The reality boats !!
