   This genocide sheds light on the intertwining between nationalist militarism 
 Israeli, the complicity of the United States, the experimentation of weapons 
 lethal and geopolitical objectives, which all converge towards the 
 objectives of a prolonged war, colonial expansion and 
 systematic eradication of the Palestinians. In particular, reveals the 
 measure that Israel's existence and function itself, such as 
 colonial training

   of settlement, is organically linked to a 
 expansive military-industrial complex that has shaped 
 basically his society and culture, the economy, the relationships of 
 foreign policy and external support.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Foundation of Israel in 1948 laid the foundations for the development of a 
  vast military-industrial complex, intricate in its structures 
 economic, social and political, which extends beyond the traditional 
 scope of defense operations. This complex system incorporates 
 a wide range of capacity, including the production of advanced weapons, lo 
 development of double use technologies, innovations in the field of 
 private safety, strategic capital investments and 
 elaborate export-self-employment strategies. In addition, it offers vast 
 job opportunities in the public and private sectors.
   <span>
   </span>
   <br/>
   A series of different actors guides this militarized matrix, 
 expanding its impact beyond the boundaries of military domains and 
 safety, to include various financial actors. These include 
 investors, contractors and technological companies, Jewish capital, 
 especially those from the military and finance sector 
 American. The influence of Israel's military-economic initiatives 
 permeates even non -military sectors, establishing collaborations with 
 academic institutions, health organizations, unions and communities 
 scientific research.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This fusion of military objectives with civil life has favored one 
 perfect integration of military and economic interests in the 
 Israeli society. The result is a vast and interconnected network in which 
  The programs of the military-economic entities are profoundly 
 rooted in the Zionist Ethos, influencing a broad spectrum of processes 
 social and political.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This document aims to highlight four fundamental pillars that 
 They feed the expansion of the military-industrial complex of Israel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Hyper-nationalistic militarism
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel's founding ethos is deeply intertwined with the 
 militarism and nationalism, creating a distinctive militarized pact 
  between the state and its citizens. This bond is considerably more 
 pronounced compared to other nations that emerged after the second war 
 world, with the Israeli army that occupies a central role not 
 Only in the safety sectors, but which extends its influence to 
 Economic, social and cultural spheres. This nuance of the boundaries between 
 Military and civil sector challenges conventional theoretical expectations 
 civil-military separation of distinct roles and identities.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Israel, the army is not only an entity of defense, but acts as 
 cardinal institution for integration and social commitment, influencing 
  a wide range of aspects of society, including education, i 
 judicial processes, media, economic initiatives and assimilation 
  of Jewish immigrants. As described by Baruch Kimmerling, the army is 
  the "central organizational principle" that binds the social fabric, 
 shaping the identity and collective values [2]. This militarism 
 pervasive is not only a transitory phase, but a belief 
 deeply rooted in the majority of Israeli Jews, who 
 indicates militarism as a fundamental ideology [3]. It is not surprising 
 that Israel is the most militarized nation in the world [4].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In Israel, the intertwining of militarism with education and the world 
 academic is profound, with the educational institutions that promote rules 
  militarists from an early age. This is evident in the way in which the 
  University are actively engaged in the development of technologies 
 military and in cultivating talents intended for the defense sector. 
 Elite programs like Talpiot and Havatzalot exemplify this 
 I wait, by equipping the students of the skills necessary to hold 
 roles in military and safety -oriented technological companies, 
 thus supporting the nation's war economy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The Israeli High-Tech sector, strongly influenced by incubators 
  of military innovation, is a milestone of the national economy, 
 contributing to 18.1% of GDP and using about 14% of the force 
 work [5]. The growth of this sector is significantly pushed 
 from synergies with the army, through government contracts, 
 cooperation and investments initiatives attracted by the skills of 
 Double use of technologies. Such collaborations have favored a 
 dynamic high-tech ecosystem, rich in growing startups and companies 
  military and safety.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Military patronage of the United States
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The relationship between the United States and Israel is basically 
 characterized by a patron-client framework, in which Israel yes 
 aligned with the strategic objectives of the United States in the Middle East in 
 change of substantial economic, military and diplomatic support, 
 establishing a reciprocal sub-imperial control.
   <br/>
   <br br=""/>
   <br/>
   A congress report underlines the transformative impact of this 
 assistance on the Israeli armed forces, without which the arsenal 
 Advanced military of Israel would be unattainable [6]. At the basis of 
 This support is the commitment of the United States to preserve the 
 qualitative military advantage (Qualitative Military Edge, QME) of 
 Israel compared to regional opponents, guaranteeing its continuous 
 military pre -finance.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The strategic partnership between the United States and Israel was started 
 moment of the foundation of Israel in 1948, but were the 
 geopolitical changes following the 1967 war to intensify 
 significantly their alliance. Recognizing Israel as a 
 critical bulwark against the rise of panorabism and influence 
 Soviet, the Nixon administration increased the support of the States 
 United, as shown by the dramatic increase in military aid from 360 
 millions of dollars in 1968 at approximately $ 2.2 billion in 1973, 
 marking an increase of 800% to the threshold of the Arab-Israeli war.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The report has further consolidated under the administration 
 Reagan, who designated Israel as an "important non-senior ally", one 
  move that has strengthened military and technological cooperation between 
 Two nations. This era was characterized by significant investments 
  of the United States in Israel's defense skills through efforts 
  of collaborative research and development, which led to integration 
  and to the dependence of Israel on US military technology. 
 This dependence is highlighted by significant defense projects such as 
  The Arrow Missilistic System, the Lavi Jet, the Merkava tank e 
 the Iron Dome system, which include American components or have been 
 developed jointly with a substantial financial contribution 
 American.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In 2016, the Obama administration raised the military assistance of 
  United states at a new level, thanks to an agreement that has increased the 
  annual aid package to Israel of 3.1 billion dollars a 
 3.8 billion dollars for the years 2019-2028, for a total of 38 
 billions of dollars, which represents the commitment of military aid 
 Bilateral more consistent in the history of the United States. This 
 Agreement represents more than 20% of the Israel defense budget.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The profound dependence on American military technology has shaped 
 significantly the competitive advantage of defense companies 
 Israeli, positioning them mainly as subcontractors in the 
 production of specialized components for US systems. 
 These include progress in GPS and navigation, simulations 
  training, optical technologies and cybersecurity measures. 
 This dynamic underlines a report in which the contractors of the 
 US defense largely establish the terms of the commitment, 
 illustrating the role of Israel as a subordinate participant 
 within the large US military-industrial complex.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    Palestine as a laboratory
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Israel has established itself as an important developer and distributor of 
  advanced military technologies, exploiting its operational experiences a 
 Gaza, in the West Bank, in Lebanon and Syria to market his 
 products such as "tested in battle". This denomination implies for 
 these technologies the fact that you have proven effective through 
 effective use in combat. However, the reality below is that 
 This effectiveness is often demonstrated through the use of these 
 technologies in highly brutal actions against populations largely 
 civilians [7].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Remote piloted aircraft (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAV), or 
 drones, they are a cornerstone of the Israeli war economy; The 
 Country is a dominant force in drones technology, with over 60% 
  of world exports in 2017 [8].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The progress and improvement of Israeli's technology technology 
  are significantly influenced by their operational use in 
 Palestinian territories. Drones have become a fixed point in 
 military operations of Israel, offering persistent surveillance on 
  Gaza. The use of drones in the wars against Gaza is brutal and aggressive, 
 leading to a series of targeted assaults, missile attacks and 
 Extraguditial kills. These operations caused the 
 Loss of civil lives and the widespread destruction of infrastructure 
 civilians.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Gaza has a dual purpose in the framework of the military-industrial complex 
 Israeli, transforming the acts of colonial aggression into 
 OPPORTUNITY TEST AND COMMERCIAL TEST OPPORTUNITIES. On the one hand, Gaza 
  It emerged as an open -air laboratory for war with drones, 
 laying the foundations for the biopolitical experimentation of new technologies 
 lethal. This situation throws a dark shadow on the commodification of 
 These technologies, rooted in practices that have nothing to do with 
  The "military necessity", but rather with a real cruelty. 
 On the other hand, Gaza provides a real scenario for defense companies 
 Israeli to show their technological progress, transforming of 
 made the besieged strip in hardware marketing platforms 
 military [9].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In every Israeli military offensive against Gaza from 2008 to 2023, i 
 Droni were central to the strategy. Models like Elbit Hermes 
 Systems and Heron Etan of Israeli Aerospace Industries, equipped with 
 advanced features such as self -targeted spike missiles, have been 
 fundamental for these attacks. Each offensive of Gaza has acted 
 like a test bench and a development platform for these drones, 
 leading to their improvement and commercial sale.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <strong>
    The trade of weapons as a normalization tool
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   In recent years, Israel has positioned itself as a significant actor 
  in the global weapon market, with 70% -80% of its production 
 military directed to international customers. This aspect of trade is 
  Fundamental for Israel, as weapons exports 
 constitute about 25% of its total export income 
 industrial, demonstrating the vital importance of military sales 
 in its economic and commercial strategies. In the period from 2014 to 
 2018, Israel was classified as the eighth supplier of weapons a 
 global level, contributing to 3.1% of the world trade of weapons 
 [10].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Sales of Israeli weapons have recorded strong growth, 
 especially following the Abraham agreements of 2020, who opened 
  Opportunities in the new markets of the Arab States. In this period, the 
 Israeli military exports have reached levels without 
 previous, with a turnover of $ 11.3 billion in 2021 e 
 a further rise to 12.5 billion dollars in 2022, of which one 
 significant part has been attributed to sales in Arab countries 
 [11].
   <br/>
   <br/>
   However, the importance of Israel's arms exports goes beyond 
  mere financial gain; they play a crucial role in his 
 international strategic positioning and in its foreign policy. 
 Defined "diplomacy of arms", Israel uses the sale of weapons for 
  achieve two main objectives: encourage normalization 
 relationships and strengthen alliances.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   First of all, weapons exports are needed to Israel as via 
 strategic to expand its global diplomatic imprint, in 
 particular with the nations that historically abstained from 
 establish formal diplomatic relationships. A recent example of this 
 strategic use of military exports is the deepening of 
 links between Israel and some Arab States of the Gulf, a relationship that is 
 passed from secret interactions to formal alliances with the agreements of 
 Abraham. These agreements have facilitated a level of cooperation 
 Unprecedented military and security, with Israel who transferred 
 military and safety technologies for a value of about 3 billion 
 dollars to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrein [12]. This development 
 marks a significant realignment in the geopolitical panorama 
 Middle Eastern, with Israel exploiting his defense skills for 
 create diplomatic connections and extend its influence in 
 region.

   <strong>
    Conclusion
   </strong>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The genocidal events in Gaza serve to remember the rooted cycle of 
 Violence and intrinsic oppression to the Israeli colonial project. 
 The latter assault is not an isolated accident, but rather 
 emblematic of a historical continuum dating back to the 1948 Nakba and that 
  has perpetuated in the following decades of conflict and hostility against 
 The Palestinian population. At the basis of this model of aggression 
 There is the crucial role played by the military-industrial complex of 
 Israel, a multifaceted apparatus that not only allows, but draws 
 actively profit from the perpetuation of colonialism of 
 settlement.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The vast implications of the military-industrial complex 
 Israeli extend well beyond the immediate context of Palestine. 
  Its destabilizing impact places serious threats to the Region and the 
 peace and world security, and basically challenges the principles of 
 self -determination and justice sanctioned by international law. 
 As such, the response of the international community to colonialism of 
 Israeli settlement and the mechanisms with which it exercises 
 Oppression and war requires urgent multilateral action e 
 coordinated to impose boycott, divestment and sanctions 
  against Israel.
