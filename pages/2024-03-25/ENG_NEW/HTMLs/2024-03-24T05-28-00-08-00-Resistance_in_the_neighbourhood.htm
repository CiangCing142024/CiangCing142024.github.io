 Every year on March 25, urban propaganda tries to inflate the minds of youth and the people with grandeurs tied up with religious "uplifting" (unity of nation and church), liar narratives and nationalist priests. It is therefore necessary, political and social spaces like the "crack", who want to be placed with the side of the people, their own history and its revolutionary traditions, to take response initiatives throughout this bombardment.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The choice of presentation of the book "200+1 Years later" was moved in this direction, this purpose sought to satisfy and eventually - from the result - was justified.
 </p>
 <p>
  The presentation took place at the "Two" bookstore on Friday, March 22. The short but very essential "opening" of the event was made by SYN. Sissy Panidou, and then - one of the two - writer Dimitris Manos, made a detailed and cohesive analysis of the characteristics and peculiarities of the Greek Revolution of 1821, the social groups that took part in it and the role of the Great Powers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The suggestion created the ground for a rich debate, but it was unable to evolve in its entire range due to limited time by the bookstore, and also passed today and the needs of the barbarism of the system and its attack on its wide layers. Today's Greek society. Perhaps the most important contribution of the presentation was that he gave birth to more study and discussion, both to youth and older, which was also reflected in book sales.
