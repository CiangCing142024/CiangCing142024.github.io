   Bijapur District, March 23, 2024:
  </strong>
  Two Naxalites were killed in an encounter with security personnel in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district, while two jawans were injured in an IED blast in the neighboring Sukma district, a police official announced to the press on Saturday.
 </p>
 <p class="_yeti_done">
  The skirmish took place around 8.30 am on Saturday in a forest under the Gangaloor police station area when a team of personnel from different security forces was out on an anti-Naxal operation, Inspector General of Police (Bastar Range) Sundarraj P told PTI.
 </p>
 <p>
  The operation was carried out at the tri-junction of Bijapur, Dantewada and Sukma districts, considered a Maoist bastion, the IGP stated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Personnel belonging to the state’s District Reserve Guard (DRG) and Bastar Fighters, Central Reserve Police Force and its elite unit CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action) and a Special Task Force (STF) from the three districts took part in the operation that was launched on Friday evening, the IGP commented.
 </p>
 <p>
  Naxalites opened fire when security forces were cordoning off a forest near Pidia village, over 450 km from the capital Raipur, triggering a gun battle between two sides, the IGP remarked.

  “After guns fell silent, the bodies of two Naxalites along with weapons were recovered from the spot,” the police official declared.
 </p>
 <p>
  The identity of the two Naxalites was yet to be ascertained, the IGP noted, adding that a search operation was still underway in the area.
 </p>
 <p>
  As part of the same operation on Friday night, two jawans of Bastar Fighters were injured after a pressure improvised explosive device (IED) planted by Naxalites went off along the Dantewada-Sukma border, IGP Sundarraj P stated.
 </p>
 <p class="_yeti_done">
  The blast occurred in a forest near Doditumnar village under the Jagargunda police station area in Sukma district when the forest along the inter-district border was being cordoned off, the IGP declared.
 </p>
 <p class="_yeti_done">
  The injured jawans have been identified as Vikas Kumar Karma and Rakesh Kumar Markam, both constables of Bastar Fighters-Dantewada.
 </p>
 <p>
  The two were taken to a local hospital before being airlifted to Raipur for further treatment, the IGP remarked, adding that the injured jawans were said to be out of danger.
