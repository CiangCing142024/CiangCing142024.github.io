 You have to be cautious, because Europe is on the verge of

 It should be remembered that this is the Ukrainian refrain for all

 roads in hand, from Moscow to Bryansk you can go to both 
 countries, given that the city is almost on the border of both. AND 
 If it is certainly true that the Russian-Ucino confinement is strongly 
 supervised due to war, the one with Belarus (allied country of 
 Moscow) it is much less. And so also for the border between Minsk and 
 Kiev.
