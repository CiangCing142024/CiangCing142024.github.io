   March 24 is not another date in the history of the Argentine people. 48 years of the last military civic coup d'etat, the most cruel, painful and bloody institutional break of our history.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the false reason for a "national reorganization", the genocides agreed to the Government by carrying out a repressive plan that covered up the economic and background adjustment of the change of productive matrix, imposing a speculative-risk-recentistic liberal model and raising the external debt to alarming levels , unemployment and poverty.

  <p>
   In spite of the 41 years uninterrupted of democracy and the work of human rights organizations in pursuit of "memory, truth and justice", we are faced with a denial government that doubts the 30 thousand colleagues detained-disappeared and bastard Human Rights Policy of our country, which is an example throughout the world. It also does not know the policies and actions that were carried out as: the impulse to the trials for crimes against humanity and the common prison for the genocides, memory and repair policies, repeal of due laws of obedience and end point, the recovery of The former creation of a space for memory and human rights, the creation of the genetic data bank, the hierarchy of CONADI and the creation of the National Memory Archive.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today we know that the objective of these state crimes was not only to kill or disappear, but to erase the history of their victims, their bodies, their names and their political projects in order to deindustrialize the country and turn it into a semi-colony.
  </p>
  <p>
   Impossible not to recall the victims of state criminal policy, which were mostly young: 29% of the disappeared were between 14 and 18 years old, 48% between 19 and 24 years old, 20% between 25 and 35 and Just 3% were over 35 years old.

    Youth faces a new social, cultural and economic crisis
   </strong>
  </p>

   Argentina is going through a deep economic recession and accumulates in just three months a 71.3% inflation, which results in an unpublished devaluation of wages. To this is added the increase in unemployment, the cut of social rights, the looting of the pocket of the retirees, the students and the limitation of access to medicines, having as a result, for those who manifest against these policies, a protocol "Anti pickets" that justifies excessive repression. It is clear, they want to reduce the fiscal deficit at the expense of adjustment and suffering.
  </p>
  <p>
   While social decomposition advances by leaps and bounds, the National Government justifies, with the speech that "there is no money", the violence of hunger: 44 thousand popular dining rooms and community spaces do not receive a single kilo of food since December 10 , added to the de -financing of the wages of the workers of the popular economy. The "caste" did not turn out to be the political class but the entire Argentine people and to play with hunger never again.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the last section of 2023, 6 out of 10 young people between 18 and 25 are poor, and according to the forecasts, the first quarter of 2024 will end with 7 out of 10 young people in the same situation.

   The Government of Milei and its "friends", deepens the critical situation that we live as a town, installing its first measures in just three months of government. It is impossible not to make an economic parallelism with that of the dictatorship, since both were directed towards the unrestricted opening of the economy, the destruction of the national industry, the deregulation of the markets and the elimination of price controls.
  </p>
  <p>
   At present, economic corporations dispute the distribution of the territory and control of the world, banks and financial groups are great decision makers regarding the global economic system, production and distribution of goods; The unfair and unequal social structure last from the so -called "Condor Plan", where the conditions for the implementation of financial capitalism in the territory were imposed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The chosen to direct the economy, main responsible for the last mega indebtedness with the IMF- which continues to condition our sovereign decisions-, imposes a program where the large economic groups are favored, and the promise of privatizing strategic public companies of the strategic public companies of the State such as Aysa, Aerolineas Argentinas, Argentine trains, YPF, Arsat, Military Fabrications and the Drawing of organizations such as INCAA and CONICET. In parallel, access to mental health, disability, and housing is violated; Public universities, gender equality and dissident policies are definance, and in turn our natural resources, policies that seek to take us towards a dollarization model that would represent an irreparable loss of sovereignty are put at risk.
  </p>
  <p>
   To this we must add the lack of respect for the institutions, a direct attack against the Republican system, whose essence is expressed in the division of powers; Examples of this are the decree of 366 articles that of "necessity and urgency" has nothing, whose labor chapter was strongly repudiated by the workers, and subsequently suspended by justice; and the Bus Law that in the Nation Congress represented a great defeat for the Government after having retired from the enclosure. However, in the face of this setback, the government sent new decrees, disregarding the message of the rest of the political arch.
  </p>
  <p>
   Those of us who subscribe here, year to be able to find through a true national unity, the necessary agreements and consensus so that in Argentina the work resumes its place as a social computer and recover dignity as a people. The sovereignty of peoples is not possible without social justice and without economic independence.
  </p>
  <p>
   With the wisdom and historical responsibility required by the time we travel, and on this date so felt for the Argentines, the referents of the different youth, trade union organizations, institutions and political groups, we celebrate the culture of the meeting over Of the differences and preserving our identities, we join in the defense of democracy, of the National Constitution, of the division of powers and social rights in it consecrated, we renew the commitment of "never again", solidarity with the most vulnerable , gender equality, the defense of our environment and the integrity of the community.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a new opportunity that Argentine history gives us to take charge as a current generation, thinking the present and the future. This moment is not just about adding wills, but about really representing and defending youth all and for this it is not only needed, ideas and proposals, also conviction, strength and courage to resist, battle and fight as They made our mothers and grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo throughout their lives. It is the best tribute that we can give them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Let's continue building memory.
  </p>
  <p>
   Never again planned misery!
