Women of the people, cooperative members, housewives, women workers and democratic teachers took the streets shouting \u201cProletarian feminism destroys the patriarchy!\u201d During the march, support was also expressed to the heroic national resistance of Palestine.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The march progressed from the mother\u2019s monument to the central square of the city. Flyers calling women to join the movement and explaining the difference between proletarian feminism and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feminism were distributed. The People\u2019s Women\u2019s Movement held speeches during the march, emphasizing that class is what separates us, not gender, and that the agenda is proletarian revolution, not the so-called \u201cgender-ideology\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As the march advanced towards the central square, it was seen that many businesses and banks had covered their windows with plywood, and the governmental palace, as well as the pavilion at the central square were also surrounded with fences and other obstacles, in an attempt to prevent the protesters from holding their rally in the end of the march. Shouting slogans, the protesters removed the fences and took over the pavilion to make their message to be heard.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After the rally, presentations were made in the forum \u201cThe Women of the Section XXII in the 21\n  <sup>\n   st\n  </sup>\n  Century\u201d, discussing problems faced by education workers.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10027\" data-id=\"10027\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"720\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8m-oaxaca.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8m-oaxaca.webp\" width=\"960\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10028\" data-id=\"10028\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2253px) 100vw, 2253px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8m-oaxaca-2.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8m-oaxaca-2.webp\" width=\"2253\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10029\" data-id=\"10029\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"996\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1772px) 100vw, 1772px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8m-oaxaca-3.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/8m-oaxaca-3.webp\" width=\"1772\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption\">\n   The People\u2019s Women\u2019s Movement took part on the march in Oaxaca, Mexico.
