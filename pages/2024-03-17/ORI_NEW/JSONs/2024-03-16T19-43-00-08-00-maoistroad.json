It was also \nattended by allied organizations, such as Solidarity International, \nARARAT Armenian Collective, MLPD, German Filipino Friendship, Kurdish \nWomen, Resbak, Philippine Buro and Interburo.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         According to BAYAN-Europe, Marcos Jr\u2019s visit to Germany and other \nEuropean countries from March 11-15 should serve as an occasion for all \nFilipino migrants and human rights defenders to condemn the brutal \nregime that commit gross violations of human rights and international \nhumanitarian law (IHL).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         \u201cIt is wrong to welcome this Marcos junket, the main purpose of which\n is to deodorize the stinking image of Marcos and his family in the \ninternational community,\u201d according to the BAYAN-Europe statement.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         Historically, the allied organizations in Germany have been among the\n most committed supporters of the movement against the Marcos fascist \ndictatorship in the 70s and 80s.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         Marcos Jr\u2019s visit is expected to seal negotiations for Germany to \nsupply drones to the Philippines supposedly for maritime security \nagainst China. This Military aid will be awarded amid the gross \nviolations of international humanitarian law and heavy militarization \nand indiscriminate bombing of the countryside perpetrated by the Marcos \nregime.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         The protesters also called on the European Union to stop supporting \nthe Marcos Jr regime by ending military aid. Germany and the EU are both\n signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which supplies military aid,\n weapons and other military equipment to the Philippines.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n         It can be recalled that during the Duterte regime, the EU strongly \ncondemned the war on drugs and human rights violations. In February \n2022, the EU Parliament issued a resolution that threatened to withdraw \nthe Philippines\u2019 GSP+ and other incentives, such as the benefit of zero \ntariff (no layer tax) on goods from the EU, if the Duterte regime did \nnot stop the violations. Germany is the largest trading partner of the \nPhilippines in Europe.\n        </p>\n       </div>\n      </div>\n     </article>\n    </div>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "Ang Bayan  March 14, 2024  Ferdinand Marcos Jr\u2019s visit to Berlin on March 13 was met with protests by Filipino migrants.
