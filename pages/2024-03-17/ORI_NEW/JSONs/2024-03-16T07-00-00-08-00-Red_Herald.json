The big bourgeoisie is at its peak with its electoral campaigns where more than 60,451 million pesos are wasted, which could well be invested in public services, education and health for the masses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The elections in Mexico are among the most expensive in the world and it is evident that the needs of the people are not a priority for the old State of landowners and big bourgeoisie despite the story of political alternation in this country where governments have already paraded from the PRI, PAN and now Morena.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Once again, none of the coalitions or parties of the big bourgeoisie, none of its representatives (without distinction of gender) has the capacity or interest to solve the problems that afflict poor people.\n  <strong>\n   Neither Claudia, nor X\u00f3chitl, nor Jorge are an alternative to anything!\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Furthermore, elections in our country have the characteristic of being particularly violent, since the different bourgeois factions usually compete not only at the polls but also with weapons. This is clear with the current data: since the beginning of the pre-campaigns last November until March 6 of this year, there have already been 23 homicides of different politicians, 13 of them aspiring to some position and 10 more who served as public servants or political operators. It is clear that the figure will not stop there and the closer the fatal date of June 2 gets closer, we will undoubtedly know more about this. It is the same as always, the bourgeois electoral farce in Mexico drips blood in each of its episodes.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The people know this, which is why they once again challenge bourgeois legality by embracing the call for a boycott against the electoral farce.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here we share some of the first actions carried out by the people in different places in the country.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Chiapas.\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9970\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"555\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chiapas-molotov-1.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chiapas-molotov-1.webp\" width=\"740\"/>\n </figure>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\">\n  <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9971\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"789\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" src=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chiapas-molotov-2.webp\" srcset=\"https://redherald.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chiapas-molotov-2.webp\" width=\"592\"/>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  On February 21, a group of people threw stones and Molotov cocktails at the facilities of the Institute of Elections and Citizen Participation in Chiapas (IEPC).
