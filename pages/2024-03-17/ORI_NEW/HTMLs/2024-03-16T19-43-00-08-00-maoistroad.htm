         <strong>
          March 14, 2024
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s visit to Berlin on March 13 was met with protests by Filipino migrants.
        </p>
        <p>
         ALPAS Pilipinas and GABRIELA-Germany led the protests. It was also 
attended by allied organizations, such as Solidarity International, 
ARARAT Armenian Collective, MLPD, German Filipino Friendship, Kurdish 
Women, Resbak, Philippine Buro and Interburo.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to BAYAN-Europe, Marcos Jr’s visit to Germany and other 
European countries from March 11-15 should serve as an occasion for all 
Filipino migrants and human rights defenders to condemn the brutal 
regime that commit gross violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law (IHL).
        </p>
        <p>
         “It is wrong to welcome this Marcos junket, the main purpose of which
 is to deodorize the stinking image of Marcos and his family in the 
international community,” according to the BAYAN-Europe statement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Historically, the allied organizations in Germany have been among the
 most committed supporters of the movement against the Marcos fascist 
dictatorship in the 70s and 80s.
        </p>
        <p>
         Marcos Jr’s visit is expected to seal negotiations for Germany to 
supply drones to the Philippines supposedly for maritime security 
against China. This Military aid will be awarded amid the gross 
violations of international humanitarian law and heavy militarization 
and indiscriminate bombing of the countryside perpetrated by the Marcos 
regime.
        </p>
        <p>
         The protesters also called on the European Union to stop supporting 
the Marcos Jr regime by ending military aid. Germany and the EU are both
 signatories to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which supplies military aid,
 weapons and other military equipment to the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
         It can be recalled that during the Duterte regime, the EU strongly 
condemned the war on drugs and human rights violations. In February 
2022, the EU Parliament issued a resolution that threatened to withdraw 
the Philippines’ GSP+ and other incentives, such as the benefit of zero 
tariff (no layer tax) on goods from the EU, if the Duterte regime did 
not stop the violations. Germany is the largest trading partner of the 
Philippines in Europe.
