  If any master had
accidentally distracted, Meloni repeats it loudly to him with determination from
"We don't want to disturb the producer." And it is clear that for the
fascist Meloni "those who produce" are precisely the masters! And it also says that "paying
taxes isn't beautiful" winking nicely at those masters,
large, small and medium-sized enterprises that do not pay taxes (remember that tax evasion in the
in the last ten years it has reached almost 1000 billion according to Il Sole 24 Ore);
Of course, all politicians, as representatives of the bourgeoisie, help the
bosses, industrialists or big finance – and they are lavishly reciprocated -
but Meloni really expresses a brazen licking.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  The comments also remind us 
 of whom this law, the so -called capital bill, approved on February 27th e 
 containing "interventions to support the competitiveness of capital", the 
 He wanted at all costs like Casiraghi, president of Illimity Bank: "The element 
 essential of this package lies in the fact that
  <b>
   The government listened to the 
 market
  </b>
  ... », and other comments say it is a law
  <b>
   That

  and SMEs have been waiting for a long time
 </b>
 Why
 <b>
  the national market of 
 capital "struggles to grow"
 </b>
 . Indeed in recent years there has been a real and 
 own escape of large groups listed by the Italian stock exchange (delisting) with 
 Losses for billions, of which the best known is that of Stellantis.
 <o:p>
 </o:p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  Meloni "listen to the market", 
 that is, the masters who always complain, and consistently
  <b>
   Who

  not yes 
 limits to the chatter, passes to the facts: from the "tax reform", in fact, to 
 This thinner, and almost invisible in the eyes of the masses: the so -called 
 Law on small and medium -sized enterprises called, as was said, "DDL capital", 
 to "attract capital".
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  In the Senate definitively: 
 "The classroom approved the rules with 80 votes in favor, the abstention of 
 Oppositions (47) and no vote against. " As you can see, and how it happened in 
 other occasions, for example the approval of the budget law, the so -called 
 opposition continues to actually support the government.
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  It is actually about
  <b>
   need 
 stringent of Italian capitalism-imperialism for competition also in 
 Finance field worldwide
  </b>
  which Meloni obeys but seeking 
 to cloak with the phrases usually on the "interests of the nation", on the capital 
 "Nostrano", "patriot" ... all impossible in the era of imperialism.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  This new law, therefore, 
 facilitates the Italian capitalists of small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) in the 
 stock exchange quotation, simplifying “the rules of governance,
  <b>
   modifying the 
 Administrative charges for businesses
  </b>
  ,
  <b>
   reviewing the control system

  by the bodies in charge such as Consob: “The capital bill must be appreciated 
 For

  He says 
 In fact, a manager of the Italian stock exchange.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  In short, the "obsession" of 
 government to save the masters also in the hope of returning 
 Some Italian groups and brands that have transferred their headquarters abroad.
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>
   Controls are abolished
  </b>
  , 
 Therefore, to give the owners free hand on operations considered at all 
 transparent, see "the repeal of the rule that imposed on subjects with the most 
 of 10% of shares to communicate operations made for Consob also for 
 interposed person ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  And there is also the most thing 
 important, the
  <b>
   modification of the criteria for the vote of members of the 
 Board of Directors
  </b>
  of these companies through which Meloni
try to get your hands on the appointments, and in fact for you the Capitals bill serves to
"limit the mechanism by which, in some cases, they are perpetuated
the boards of directors ad infinitum, regardless of the shareholders" and for this reason more weight is given to the vote
of so-called minority investors to facilitate a group instead of a
such as the Mediobanca and Generali deals, in the hope of
Promote "members" who are loyal and stable Italians.
  <o:p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  This possibility of "attempting to

 millions to € 1 billion, in order to allow

  ”, 
 It also serves to bring the money that the rich hold in the current accounts (
  <b>
   about 
 1,800 billion
  </b>
  ) or in investment funds, in the system 
 industrial-financial: «There are 18.5 billion of PIR funds that on SMEs does not

 President of ASSONEXT. And another "expert" adds “We have pension funds e 
 Pension speakers that manage over 300 million euros ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  To facilitate this
  <b>
   collection
  </b>
  There is also the push to popular banks to get busy if they want 
 transform into joint stock companies "for which the minimum asset threshold 
 For the transformation into SPA it goes from 8 to 16 billion ".
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  According to a financial newspaper 
 This DDL
  <b>
   “It would also attribute large powers to the Italian government for 
 reform the consolidated text of finance and the discipline on the companies of 
 capital contained in the Italian civil code ".
   <o:p>
   </o:p>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  All Queto is part of the 
 "Vision for Italy" (fascist) by Meloni who proceeds "360 °" like the 
 I like to say. A "vision" that propaganda every day from every pulpit ... in this 
 sense is also to be seen in this new law

 financial in schools

  !
  <o:p>
  </o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  To this "vision" of 
 strengthening of Italian capitalism-imperialism within the process of 
 transformation of the country in a modern fascist sense, workers and masses 
 popular can and must oppose their vision of radical reversal of 
 This government and this system.
