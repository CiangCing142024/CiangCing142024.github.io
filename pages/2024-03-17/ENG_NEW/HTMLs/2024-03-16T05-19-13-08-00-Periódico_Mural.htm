  The so-called "Mayan Train" is celebrated as a prestigious project by Mexico's powerful. Behind this wonderful name is hidden a lethal mega-project of the imperialists, a waste of millions at the expense of the population and the environment. On the side of the people, there is great resistance, especially from the indigenous peoples, who completely reject and fight against the "Mayan Train" as an attack on their way of life and democratic rights.

   High speed train for tourists - the population resists
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p class="has-text-align-justify">
  At 160 km/h, the high-speed train moves like lightning on the 1,500 km railway routes through the Yucatan Peninsula in southern Mexico. From now on, construction costs exceed 2.5 times the initial costs (from 7.4 billion to almost 20 billion), which are extracted from the pockets of the population through taxes – to increase the profits of foreign consortiums. Meanwhile, this train is not for the population, but to further increase the overflowing tourism in the region. And all this on account of the historical territories of the Maya, of the workers and peasants in the region and finally of a unique ecosystem, which is important for the survival of Mexico.

    "Industrialization" of Mexico does bureaucratic capitalism?
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   What Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador calls part of an even larger project of the "industrialization of southeastern Mexico" is nothing more than another liquidation of the country to the imperialist monopolies, in the case of the "Mayan Train" especially the French train company Alstrom. This means the opposite of real industrialization or economic development, but a stronger subordination and exploitation of land and population by foreign capital. Mexico's powerful take on the role of lackeys for the interests of foreign monopolies. The
   <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2023/07/10/un-tren-afrancesado/">
    “Periodo Mural”
   </a>
   explains this relationship well: "
   <em>
    This example helps to understand the phenomenon of bureaucratic capitalism in the oppressed countries because, subject to the domination of imperialism [...] science, technology, the means of production, production itself, imports and capital are the property of imperialism and for its private benefit, while export and commercialization will be the task of Mexico in a megaproject that links "Tren Maya" and the Interoceanic Corridor with a more extensive railway network throughout the country. Central America."
   </em>
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   The "Mayan Train" is connected with another a hostile project against the town - called interoceanic corridor. This corridor should be called a “giga-project”, because it consists of 12 mega-projects de facto, which must connect the Atlantic and Pacific with a load trains railroad. In summary, these projects threaten all of southern Mexico and are based on the economic interests of imperialist monopolies. Also now leaves behind a gigantic blood trail in the country.
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Despite the harsh repression, the population is not intimidated and fights valiantly against these attacks on their way of life. Numerous international solidarity activities also strengthen this struggle and show the link of the oppressed in the struggle against imperialism. So we share here the slogan
   <em>
    "Against the mega-projects of dispossession and death, fight and resist."
