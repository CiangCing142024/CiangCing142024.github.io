  revealed on Thursday (14) that Brazil is one of the five largest suppliers of crude oil to Israel, along with the United States, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Gabon and Russia.

Tens of thousands more are injured or missing under the rubble, possibly dead, and survivors face starvation as Israel has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid. On the Israeli side, 1,388 people were murdered.

  “The dynamics of the oil industry is so cruel that, even while President Lula is considered Persona non grateful by the Israeli far-right government, Brazil feeds the Benjamin Netanyahu war machine with Brazilian oil,” says Claudio Angelo, coordinator of International Policy of the Climate Observatory. "This is a problem, but it can also be an instrument of pressure from the Brazilian government for a ceasefire."

"We appeal to nations to take advantage of oil supply as a way to demand an immediate ceasefire and the end of the occupation," said Allie Rosenbluth, program manager of

  Historical Allies of Israel, the United States sent three fuel navies to military jet. The last of them was seen at the Israeli Port of Ashkelon on March 6. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq carry crude oil through the Sumed oil. Israel receives from this small, but constant oil remittances. These countries have also criticized Israel's stance in war.
