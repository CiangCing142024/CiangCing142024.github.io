   Her 
  Thursday 14/3 lost his life falling from a high height of 54 years of our fellow citizen, a painter, 
  In a newly -built building in the center of Trikala. We denounce the 
 deadly work "accident" added to the long list of 
 workers 'sacrifices for employers' profits. The builders with the 
 Great unemployment that plagues the industry and by increasing boundaries 
 Age for retirement, in their attempt to complete the 
 stamps, are forced to work at an early age, in a job with 
 Great physical fatigue, non -existent means of protection and huge 
 intensification. Everything to get the "job" out. The result of all of them 
 It is the high frequency of 'accidents' that leaves crumpled and 
 Dead, as in this case. Within a year in Trikala we had 3 
  Death of workers.

   Increasingly 
  and more often, the working class and workers give blood tax 
 on the altar of capital profits. The inhumane and exterminating 
 conditions, endless hours of work, constant pressure and terrorism 
 of employers and the lack of security measures, the increase in times for 
  retirement are shaping the ground for the country's employees to 
 They are constantly counting and more dead and crushed. ELPE, 
 Everest, construction sites, deliberates, subway, employees of local OTAs, 
 Milk industries…. And the bloody list grows everyday.

   THE 
  voting and implementing a series of anti-labor laws- culminating in 
 Hatzidakis Law (8 -hour abolition, extension of the abolition of 
 Sunday holiday, criminalization of trade unionism and hitting the 
 right to strike) and the subsequent burst of the employer, 
 but also chronic disintegration of unions have led to a new 
 Middle Ages.

   Call
 workers and unemployed to denounce the overall 
a regime of blackmail and insecurity prevailing in the workplace, 
where more and more workers are forced to work with the 
their lives in constant danger, with inadequate or no safety measures, 
succumbing under the fear of redundancy and unemployment. To 
organize their struggle, and enter massively into the struggle for the 
defending their right to work with rights, decent 
wages and human conditions. To reverse its policy 
barbarism and the working middle ages!
