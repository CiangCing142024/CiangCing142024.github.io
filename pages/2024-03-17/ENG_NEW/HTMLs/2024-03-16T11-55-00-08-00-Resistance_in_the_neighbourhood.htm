 The mobilization in Piraeus was held on Thursday 14/3 against the depth of our country's involvement in the US -EU -Israel war plans. At the same time that the slaughter of the Palestinian people continues by the fascist -Zionist state of Israel, the Greek shipowners decided to cross their ships by the Red Sea. This move has the full support of the government, which entangles the country and the people in the bloody and war plans of the imperialist murderers. Already, the first signs are obvious with a tragic account of two dead seamen, after a bombing on a merchant ship of Greek interests.
 <br/>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The mobilization was called by the Piraeus Labor Center, at the initiative of PENEN. The call was responded to unions, organizations and colleges, including the Piraeus Popular Resistance, where it participated with banners and distributed its announcement to the people of Piraeus.
  <br/>
  Such initiatives, not only should be taken, but the struggle against the slaughter of the Palestinian people and the immediate involvement of our country must be strengthened. In this direction the labor and popular movement must fight against the illusions and rationales that can undermine the struggle.

  At least challenging one would characterize the presence of the new Left in the concentration of this form by the SYRIZA viscera, by what it means! It is at least provocative and hypocritical, considering the attitude they had all the time, either in government positions or as an "opposition". Their clear positions for Israel's "right" to self -defense, the common axes with the Zionist killers, the service of dependence and slavery to the American murderers, and the policy that gave the country, from side to side, to NATO, turning to NATO, turning to NATO. The base for the slaughter of the peoples of the wider area makes them at least unwanted and hypocritical!
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  The decision to gather at this point, with the symbolic nature, reaching the offices of the Greek Shipowners' Union, did not allow the people of the area to be massively involved. The mobilizations must continue and get more massive characteristics because the government and capital are ready to sacrifice us for the interests of the imperialists! Piraeus Popular Resistance in this direction is struggling and will continue to do so with all its might.
