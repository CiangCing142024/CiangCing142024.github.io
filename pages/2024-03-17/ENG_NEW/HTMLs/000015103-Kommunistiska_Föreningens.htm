   Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, even though he has served his verdict. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by US imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed people from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons.

   The fear of the ruling classes for the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enemy they feel towards them is so great that they recklessly prevent the communists and revolutionaries they have captured in open violation of their own laws from leaving the prisons. The murder of chairman Gonzalo 2021, leader of Peru's Communist Party, who lost his health after 29 years in isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary measures were not taken, is very important to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the Servila owners of the governing system. Those responsible for Chairman Gonzalo's death even burned up and destroyed his body.

   The communist and revolutionary prisoners in the prisons try to meet the requirements of the class struggle and risk their lives by enduring the height of brutal prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to withstand all types of pressure, torture and insulation. We must mobilize to support the prisoners 'legitimate struggle and resistance, we must fight against all forms of aggression against the prisoners, we must be the prisoners' voice outside, we must support their struggle in the prison conditions as part of the class struggle outside.
