 Did not prevent the Pierrakakis law be passed on 
 Establishment of non -state foreign university branches in the country through 
 bypassing Article 16 and with more brutality met the 
 Rector and in general the administration of the University of Thessaly with 
 US Ambassador to Greece, George Tsouni. In the midst of the fair fight of 
  Student masses against private universities and law-lack 
  Pierrakaki, discussed the "opening" of the PH in the "world environment 
 Education "and" Expanding the Cooperation capabilities of PH with 
 American universities, research institutes. "
 <p>
 </p>
 <div class="entry-content">
  <p>
   Of course, behind these lines we know very well what they have in 
 their minds the Americans and their local minions, which are no more 
  by the dependent Greek bourgeoisie. With these words do not 
 prepare anything other than the depths of the country's dependency, the 
 Further sale - economic and political - to imperialists and 
 Chronic pursuit of harmonizing education in American 
 "standards". Especially after the Pierrakakis law is passed, they plow the 
 ground for the establishment of foreign university branches in Greece, such as 
  The establishment of the announced private medical school in Athens by 
  American fund holding 6 private clinics in the country and the 
 Sold 10% of PPC. They want to intensify the 'brain drain' phenomenon 
 transferring workers' potential from interior abroad, where 
  They will staff the great imperialist metropolises.
  </p>
  <p>
   The peoples of the peoples and their embassy - which at the moment 
 bloodshed Ukraine and Palestine, who have made the 
 Thessaly and Greece in general a vast death base with the 
 Their American bases - they don't stop there! Years now they want 
 to intervene and exploit the education of the country (see 
 Letter from the US Embassy to the Ministry of Education in 2009). Their 
 annoys that students here still study free and still have 
 Rights that the student movement won with its struggle! 
 They constantly hit public-dimensional education, they want to get tuition, 
 Deletions and Limits of study, want dissolved diplomas, one education for 
 Few and chosen, a university without student associations, 
 Games and free progressive views. It is known that the 
 Pierrakaki bills were promoted to cover these 
 Aspirations of the foreign "prostate" of the domestic bourgeoisie!
  </p>
  <p>
   And in the midst of it all, they want higher education at the service of 
armaments. The construction of a military drone by schools of the University of Thessaloniki
 in collaboration with the Hellenic Air Force, it is recent! 
They prepare to develop further war research and give 
Clear message that the urban university will only work for 
their interests and the service of the sharpened inter-imperialists 
their controversies. And the Administration of UTH "first and best" opens 
the way to the murderers of the peoples to achieve the most bloodthirsty plans
 their!
  </p>
  <p>
   We have nothing to expect anything good from this system 
 exploitation and oppression, taking part in the mackene 
 whole peoples. To oppose this black reality. To 
 We resist the depth of the country's dependency. Along with the people and the 
  labor, to build anti-war-anti-imperialist front, which 
 will put a brake on their war operations and its involvement 
 our country on the war fronts, which are constantly open against peoples 
 of the world!
  </p>
  <p>
   Not let the imperialists take command in studies 
 us. To defend public-free education. To continue the 
 Our struggle for the overthrow of Pierrakakis Law. Against 
 reformist left (MSc-EAKA), which puts a brake on the occupations, the 
 Assemblies and in the mobilizations in general, trapped in 
 deadlocked logic "not to apply the voted law", which leads the 
 Struggling student masses in frustration and submission to 
 Urban legitimacy of the system.
  </p>
  <p>
   We make our schools resistance! We continue with 
 Assemblies-Services-Divisions until we throw the voted law 
 For private universities!
