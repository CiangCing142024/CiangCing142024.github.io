The press release dates back to February 29, two weeks after that cursed February 16.\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201cI thank Esselunga for quickly accepting our request. The public works envisaged in\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n This part of the city have been awaited by citizens for a long time and will make the neighborhood more livable and functional. \"\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  After 5 deaths, 3 serious injuries, subcontracting, illegal hiring, entrusting the work to a company already responsible for other serious accidents at work, this city does not really owe any thanks to Esselunga! Under no circumstances! \"Thanks\" for what, then, exactly?\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  \"Esselunga - reads the press release - undertakes to continue the processing also with the construction of the garden located in via Ponte di Mezzo, whose management and maintenance will also be accepted\". In order to clean up Esselunga from the blood shed by the workers, the management of the garden is also entrusted to him in via Ponte di Mezzo. It is evident that Nardella is trying to exploit and use the popular feeling that emerged in these weeks for the benefit of Esselunga, who is loudly asking for the creation of a park. However, it does so in a clumsy and broken way.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But we don't make fun of ourselves. Our request is clear: a public park named after the 5 workers who died in the construction site instead of the shopping center. It is not enough to use the word \"park\" or \"garden\" to silence the neighborhood and the entire city. Nardella plays with pain, with anger, with the strikes and with the square ... a serious mistake, a few weeks after the vote, but evidently the need to serve the powerful shift also exceeds the enhanced balances and promises to which they have us accustomed in the election campaign!\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "description": "Today 3 pm garrison in via husbands 23 March demonstrates a useful initiative to keep the spotlight on the workers' massacres but ch ...", "author": ["LuigiLerisVIVE"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/03/pc-16-marzo-1-mese-dalla-strage-di.html", "source_name": "proletari comunisti"}
