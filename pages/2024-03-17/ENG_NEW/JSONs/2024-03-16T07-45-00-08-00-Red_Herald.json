The growth of popular rejection to the current government, recorded in the three surveys, has its main motivation in the conduct of the national economy and its consequences in the lives of the popular masses. In the Atlas Intel survey, dated on 7\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  of March, 40% of respondents disapprove the government, two percentage points above those who approve. As for the economy, 53% believe it is doing badly (an increase of 5% compared to the previous survey, in January); it is the first time in this government that the negative evaluation of the economy exceeds 50%. The Quaest survey, dated on 27\n  <sup>\n   th\n  </sup>\n  of February, points out that the perception of 73% of those interviewed is that prices have risen \u2013 the same topic, in the previous survey, was 48%.\n </p>\n <p>\n  As it turns out, seasonal improvements in the GDP index and \u201cjob creation\u201d are just statistics. It is already popular wisdom that a government of the exploiting classes lies in two ways: one is by actually lying, blatantly, the other is by publishing statistics that, by showing everything, hide what is fundamental. The 3% GDP growth is an artificial number led by the record harvest of the agro-export latifundium, which exports of their production, for example, do not contribute to taxes income; they do not bring any improvement to the economic situation of the majority of the population, that is, workers, as is the case with the price of the basic food basket, which became more expensive again in February (in 14 of the 17 capitals, there was an increase in prices). Just in Rio de Janeiro, the increase was an average of 5.1%.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   Luiz In\u00e1cio cannot talk too much about \u201cagribusiness\u201d either, as it would sound strange, even more so after having given him the biggest Harvest Plan in the country\u2019s history, much superior to Bolsonaro\u2019s, while, for the \u201cagrarian reform\u201d of the old State , in 2023 and 2024, the current government allocated a miserable R$2 billion, the same amount that Bolsonaro had allocated in 2021. We all said that Bolsonaro wanted the death of \u201cagrarian reform\u201d; What does Luiz In\u00e1cio want, beyond his old story as a tricker in front of the popular masses?\n  </p>\n  <psup>\n   th\n   of March, the reactionary president said that \u201cthe Armed Forces have always interfered in politics\u201d. The observation shows that the president is not ignorant, and not innocent either: his policy of conciliation and appeasement with the coup generals is a conscious attitude typical of the pusillanimous, and this in politics is worse than ignorance or inability. Due to his stance and conduct in the face of the country\u2019s situation, Luiz In\u00e1cio is entirely incapable of stopping the coup. He is, at most, postponing it without caring if it breaks down, in the lap of any other next president, really just wanting to rewrite the end of his already dirty biography.\n  </psup>\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n </p>\n</div>\n", "pdf_content": null, "pdf_links": [], "source": "https://redherald.org/2024/03/15/and-weekly-editorial-shift-government-balances-on-tight-rope/", "type": "article", "title": "AND: Weekly Editorial \u2013 Shift government balances on tight rope \u2013 The Red Herald", "description": "For objective reasons, it is necessary to view opinion polls, conducted by certain organizations that pay for them, with some suspicious, including due to certain methods; however, the last three surveys made public that evaluate the performance of the current government, with similar results, allow us to observe trends.", "modified time": "2024-03-15T22:30:24+00:00", "author": ["T.I."], "categories": ["Featured", "The Americas"], "tags": ["Brazil"], "sections": ["Featured", "The Americas", "Brazil", "English", "pll_65f4cc52d079e"], "source_name": "Red Herald"}
