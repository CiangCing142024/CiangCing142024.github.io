In contrast to other countries, the advanced music was not heard from one or more \"target groups\" mainly from the small bourgeoisie, but achieved the broad masses and, partly led by communists, a not insignificant danger.\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  The members of the Hoola Bandoola Band, who were active between 1970 and 1976, were the most famous representatives of the progg.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"584\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLHMX5o5fAc\" title=\"Hoola Bandoola Band Keops pyramid\" width=\"779\">\n  </iframe>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/puSv_alUo6g\" title=\"Hoola Bandoola band - P\u00e5 v\u00e4g\" width=\"912\">\n  </iframe>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  (Translatable texts on the songs can be found on the Internet)\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  In 1975 it was mobilized throughout the movement to drive a tennis game of the Swedes in the Davis Cup against Chile - which was then under the military dictatorship of Pinochets - to drive the holiday resort of B\u00e5stad to sabotage the game in front of the eyes of all the bon aus. The Hoola Bandoola Band delivered the right fighting song with \"Stopa match\" (\"Stop the game!\").\n </p>\n <p>\n  <iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"584\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mt5EaTMBE6o\" title=\"Hoola Bandoola Band - Stoppa Matchen\" width=\"779\">\n  </iframe>\n </p>\n <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  After the band was dissolved, some members continued individually.
