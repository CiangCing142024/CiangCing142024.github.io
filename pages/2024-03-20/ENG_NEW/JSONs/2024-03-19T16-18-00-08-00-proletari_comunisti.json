The Minister of the Interior\n    <strong>\n     Piantedosi\n    </strong>\n    In fact, he would have developed a plan that provides for \"limited and \n controlled \"to the universities and to place the police at the entrance \n of the classrooms where conferences and appointments are held to block the \n disputes. The indiscretion follows the very hard statements of the \n Minister of Agriculture, as well as brother -in -law of Giorgia Meloni, Francesco \n Lollobrigida, which declared none other than a \"excess of \n tolerance \u00bbtowards disputes could lead to risks \n terrorist in the country.\n   </p>\n   <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n    Do not take measures against episodes such as that of Naples,\n    <strong>\n     in fact he declared Lollobrigida,\n    </strong>\n    \"in the past\n    <strong>\n     then led to terrorism\n    </strong>\n    and its reinforcement up to the episode of Aldo Moro, who, with his \nsacrifice, created such a broad democratic alarm that it allowed us to\n to defeat the brutal phenomenon of subversion.\" Nevertheless \nthe juxtaposition of the events seems fanciful, to say the least, the Viminale \nHe would already be running for cover. To trigger the concern of the \ngovernment\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <a name=\"more\">\n   </a>\n   In fact, they would be a series of meetings that should be held \nin Italian universities in the coming days and which could be \nstrongly contested by the \"pro-Palestine front\" and against Israel. For \nThat reason, according to the rumours made public by the\n   <em>\n    Corriere della Sera\n   </em>\n   , the government would be assumed more stringent security measures\n   <strong>\n    on classroom entrances\n   </strong>\n   where the meetings will have to be held, which from now on could \n also be placed under the lens of the provincial committees for order e \n  public safety in the Prefecture, as well as the nonsense and of the \n Relative technical tables. Given the non -predictable character of these types \n of protests, then, could be\n   <strong>\n    surveillance before conferences increased\n   </strong>\n   , \n  hypothesis that heralds the presence of contingents of the forces \n of the order to preside over the classrooms. For its part, the minister \n of the Anna Maria Bernini University braked the hypothesis advanced by \n Viminale, but he convened a meeting with the rectors for the next \n Thursday, to agree with them the methods of repression of \n protests.\n   <p>\n   </p>\n   <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n    If the measures were to be put in place \npractice, we would be faced with yet another attempt at this \ngovernment to trivialize protests and social demands.
