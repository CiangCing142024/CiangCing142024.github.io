Thus, the work that began in September/2023, is expected to end the month of March/2024.\n </p>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  Celebrations and honors\n </h4>\n <p>\n  Uniting collectives, supporters and residents, the brigade was held on March 9 in order to accelerate the work in force. In addition to the work in the work itself, a collective feijoada was also prepared in the popular school kitchen, activities with children and sweepstakes for those present.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was also a moment of celebration and honors to emphasize the importance of International Proletarian Women's Day, with women of the occupation present, when a pamphlet was published by the Popular Women's Movement.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-171232\" data-id=\"171232\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"826\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_67227137-scaled-e1710877846653-1024x826.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_67227137-scaled-e1710877846653-1024x826.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-171233\" data-id=\"171233\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_67519745-768x1024.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_67519745-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\"/>\n  </figure>\n </figure>\n <p>\n  Finally, but not least, the tribute to the companion Perla. Perla was a woman in the fight, despite her serious health problems (fought lupus), was present in this fight for housing since the beginning, in 2020, when she raised her small canvas shack. Perla has always been present in the school activities, participating in training courses, ensuring the organization and preservation of the school and also showing interest in teaching reinforcement classes for children.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Last January, the partner Perla passed away after contracted Covid, a picture that complicated her health problem already affected by Lupus. Mother of 4 children, Perla left her small shack, who over these years, with a lot of effort, turned into a masonry house, but, more than that, left the example for so many other women who are in the fight for the fight for home. Therefore, to remember this great companion, the school was named \u201cPopular School Perla Albuquerque Lima\u201d.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-171229\" data-id=\"171229\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"824\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_50727169-1024x824.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_50727169-1024x824.jpg\" width=\"1024\"/>\n  </figure>\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-171230\" data-id=\"171230\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"1024\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_67222529-768x1024.jpg\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image_67222529-768x1024.jpg\" width=\"768\"/>\n  </figure>\n </figure>\n <h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\n  And the mayor?\n </h4>\n <p>\n  While residents build their housing infrastructure and struggle more and more for dignity, the mayor, in an election year, promised to have the electricity poles install in the occupation, which currently still has very precarious lighting. The promise was made last year, on the first day of the exhaustion works, giving it a period of 15 days, but, as expected, the people are still without the promised posts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The mayor doubts the intelligence and capacity of the organized people: while promising worlds and funds in the hope of getting votes, it maintains in court a process of repossession of the land where the occupation Luiz Gomes was established.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/pb-ocupacao-no-interior-da-paraiba-realiza-brigada-de-obras-no-dia-internacional-da-mulher-proletaria/", "type": "article", "title": "PB: Occupation in the interior of Para\u00edba holds works brigade on the International Day of Proletarian Women - The New Democracy", "description": "Residents of the occupation Luiz Gomes in Campina Grande, with the supporters supporters, made a brigade to finish the work to implement water pipes and thus enable quality access to water for all.", "modified time": "2024-03-19T16:51:33-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-19T16:51:33-03:00", "author": ["Comit\u00ea de Apoio \u2013 Campina Grande (PB)"], "categories": ["Nacional"], "tags": ["luta por moradia"], "sections": ["Nacional"], "link-section": "nacional", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
