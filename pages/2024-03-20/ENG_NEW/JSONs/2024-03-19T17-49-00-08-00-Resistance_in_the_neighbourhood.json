Dozens of police officers were in front of the courthouse gates, blocking almost anyone who tried to enter the courts to see their own people, with the exception of only a few (!) parents, after being scrutinized. It is clear that they are trying to create a climate of terror and persecution against students fighting to overturn the law.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The gathering was attended by Student Associations, organizations and collectives of Thessaloniki and slogans were heard against the persecutions, for the overthrow of the Pierrakakis law against which students have been fighting for 2 and a half months.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Students released you early in the afternoon, followed by a dynamic course in the city center that ended up in the FA. The trial got postponement for the end of March.\n </p>\n <p>\n  They do not terrorize us!\n </p>\n <p>\n  We continue the struggle for the overthrow of Pierrakakis law through our student clubs!\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u03a3.\u039c."], "labels": ["\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac", "\u03bd\u03b5\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_93.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
