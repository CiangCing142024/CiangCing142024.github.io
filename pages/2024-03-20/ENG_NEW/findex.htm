  Hannover | 19.03.2024 | On March 18, the political prisoners and the Solidarity Day, Rote Hilfe (Red Aid) and Atif Hannover, including many revolutionary democratic institutions, including a march was held.
 </p>
<p>
  In the speech made in the name of Atiif, it was emphasized that as long as there was the imperialist capitalist order, there would be persecution and exploitation, that those who resist against it were always and that the prisoner oppressed were important to be the voice of the outside. The action, which started at 18.00, ended after about two hours.

  After the march of March 8 in Medellín, which was highlighted for its mass and combativeness, the Mayor's Office of the Antioquia capital took a sign with the face of 8 women who participated in the march, accusing them of vandalism and damage to metroplus stations. Along with this poster several people belonging to the ruling classes such as Federico Gutiérrez and Andrés Julián Rendón, went out to criminalize the fair struggle of popular women on social networks. Some women were also intimidated and retained by the police for having green or purple scarves.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-eca601199a19f6e875f5ab11b1e9d918">
  Some women's organizations have denounced the criminalization of the protest and under the slogans "fighting is not a crime" and "the woman looking for me" have promoted a campaign of denunciation in solidarity with the women indicated. This week they are inviting to paint a fabric and make a complaint. Some of the complaints made by these organizations is the speed with the old state condemns the popular struggle and the inefficiency and null from town.
 </p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a5301aa95fba9a40a25cee6686b7a5b0">
  In addition, within the framework of the month in which the struggle of the working, peasant and popular woman is commemorated, photographic records of a poster of posters and some pints made by revolutionary women have arrived, where the criminalization of the protest is denounced, where revolutionary and communists are claimed, as well as the struggle of the Palestinian people and where they call the organization and struggle of women.

   The dictatorship with 30,000 missing detainees could not achieve its dream. And what was your dream? It is in force in this DNU and in this mega law: iron 30 million Argentines to be poor obedient. Something that remains in Brazil with 20 years of dictatorship that takes you the caipirinha to the sea, which makes a gastronomic in Argentina.
  </p>
<p>
   That is, a social discipline to be able to permanently exploit the people, that is the legal certainty of those foreign investments that Martínez de Hoz dreamed and that dreams of Milei. That is the goal of the DNU. Look how that is shipwrecked in the wave of struggle of these 100 days of government. We started with a small day on December 12, cacerolazos on December 20, march of December 27, unemployment of January 24, new days at the doors of the Ministry of Human Capital, March 8 that was blunt by women , today we are with the 500 route cuts and the entire town in the street is fundamental on March 24.
  </p>
<p>
   That project that in the dictatorship had the focus to suppress, put in jail and make the hundreds of thousands of factory delegates disappear, and that systematically seeks to destroy the popular organization, which seeks to plunge Argentina into that agency and in that submission of the people, hides their head and emerges systematically, and never achieved it, or with genocide.
  </p>
<p>
   Look that Kirschbaum on the weekend said in the analysis of
   <em>
    Clarion
   </em>
   “You cannot live in a permanent crisis situation. The support that the government still maintains cannot be sustained in this way. ” And that is the crisis that is lived now, after the defeat with the vote against the DNU in the Senate, where federalism joined against the decrees. You cannot treat the provinces, that offense generates popular resistance, in a country that is also multicolored. For example, in Santa Cruz there is also anger because the Chinese dam has cut its investment and has thousands in the street; You can mistreat the sugar lords but that will generate problems in the north; You can try to release investments in lithium and mining and you will have problems with some that already have closed businesses.
  </p>
<p>
   That is, he received a new slapping and the DNU fails to approve. That ironing project to millions of Argentines in submissive poverty is shipwrecked with the DNU. And this is the product of this growing struggle of the people, which progresses to generate a political crisis.
  </p>
<p>
   In La Libertad Avanza, the contradiction between Milei and Villarruel exploded. Small theme. In addition there is also that of Zago, president of the block, and now Espert, who is a new president of the block. That is, freedom progresses itself is complicated. The pro remained among those who say that you have to merge with lla, that they cannot hesitate because all their fate would be tied to Milei, and those who say that it has many possibilities of failing and if the entire liberal project is stuck, the entire liberal project resists the Fusion and sought to share the government, but Milei does not give rise, and is co -opting figures like sorry. That is, the pro is left. In the UCR Lousteau based on the unconstitutionality of the decree he voted against and together with Manes, he would add 11 votes against deputies but the radical governors are negotiating with the government.
  </p>
<p>
   In the popular field there is also a debate, a part is wrongly poses that you have to do as with the pear, wait for discontent to mature and we will weaving an electoral braid and a part that goes out with everything to resist.
  </p>
<p>
   Do not give him time, you have to stop it, because there is another exit for Argentina, this was also in debate since that time of the coup. Of course, if another policy is applied. Today you asked, if it is another policy, will it be another government? Yes, if it is another policy, it will be necessary to achieve it with another government. You once asked me this question, when the criticisms of Alberto Fernández's policy were raised, and he said, "well, changing the course", because that government could be changed to the course; But these are not, these are determined, every time they receive a stumble they accelerate.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    De Renzis:
   </strong>
   These is the other way around, the government must be changed so that the course does not follow.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Arnoldo Gómez
   </strong>
   : First, you have to stop it, stop the DNU, and on the basis of twisting your arm, then see how it follows.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    De Renzis
   </strong>
   : I have the idea that they are operating with great intensity in deputies, because they do not want another failure, which would be very overwhelming a new failure.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Arnoldo Gómez
   </strong>
   : If you add all the votes of the PRO and Freedom Avanza are 77, of the UCR they say add 23, according to how the senators voted, they would be in 100 votes; If you add Jaldo, Espert and Misiones, they can reach 115 votes. On the other side, Unión for the Homeland has 99 votes, plus 11 that the radicals of Manes and Lousteau would contribute we would be in 110, plus the 5 of the FIT, the 2 of Santa Cruz, Natalia de la Sota, you have to see Stolbizer and Lilitos add up 120. There is very even the thing. They would need 129. Therefore, the issue of pressure in each town is not secondary here on how their deputies vote. Today's 500 cuts are significant in that direction. And on March 24 that is resonant to locate the hand of those hesitating votes in Parliament.
  </p>
<p>
   That is why they are in doubt, because they cannot receive such a defeat. They negotiate to turn votes. And they doubt. Then they are also in the dilatar tactics, that is, that it is not discussed, does not vote, and on that basis the DNU is still in force. A DNU that has the rejection of the Senate and fails to be discussed in deputy? Can the current DNU make legal certainty possible, iron the people and achieve investments? It is very indebble that.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    De Renzis
   </strong>
   : Meanwhile, no matter how weak it is valid and takes advantage of, for example, the prepaid.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Arnoldo Gómez
   </strong>
   : Of course, it has damage capacity. Although the goal of ironing for years the people are already injured.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    De Renzis
   </strong>
   : It is not legally well located, but in the meantime it harms.
  </p>
<p>
<strong>
    Arnoldo Gómez
   </strong>
   : Therefore, you have to repeal it. That is, we must not stop, you have to go to a blunt March 24. It is a very positive step that the CGT conveters and gathers with the two CTA and social movements. On this basis, advance and give continuity with an active strike and federal march.
  </p>
<p>
   Then there are some wrong positions of some sectors, which raise two acts. Most will come out and overflow the square, this is growing day by day and the active national unemployment has to come to repeal the DNU.
  </p>

<strong>
   March 18 - the day of solidarity with political prisoners - in honor of the communist and revolutionary prisoners
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  March 18 is the international day of solidarity with political prisoners. Red help was founded by the Comintern in 1920, and declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the founding of the parish municipality, as "the international day of solidarity with political prisoners" and devoted it to the political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity is expressed with political prisoners around the world.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   "The philosophers have only
   <em>
    interpret
   </em>
   the world different; But what it depends on is to
   <em>
    change
   </em>
<p p="">
<p>
     The reactionary Indian state has blocked over ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent the war.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, even though he has sentenced his punishment. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed people from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons.
    </p>
<p>
     The fears of the ruling classes of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class hatred they feel against them are so great that they ruthlessly prevent the communists and revolutionaries they hold trapped in open violations of their own laws from leaving the prisons. The murder of chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the head of PCP, who lost health after 29 years in isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary health measures were not implemented, is very important to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred as the imperialists and the servile owners of The ruling system feels. Those responsible for chairman Gonzalo's death burned and even destroyed his body.
    </p>
<p>
     The communist and revolutionary prisoners in the prisons strive to meet the requirements of the Class Fight, with the risk of their own lives by challenging the boundaries of the conditions in the prisons. They refuse to capitulate and hesitate to resist all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against the prisoners, in order to be the prisoners' voice outside the walls, we must support their struggle during the detention conditions as part of the class struggle.
    </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      The communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Supporting the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Let's make the communist and revolutionary prisoners 'resistance and struggle for our own, let's be the prisoners' voice!

<p>
  At a ministerial meeting, today, the country's agent, Luiz Inacio, fired against Jair Bolsonaro: “If three months ago when we talked about coup it seemed only insinuation, today we are sure that this country was in serious danger of having a blow due to From the 2022 elections. And there was no blow not only because some people who were in charge of the Armed Forces did not want to do, they did not accept the president's idea, but also because the president is a cowardly. He did not have the courage to execute what he planned, he was in the house crying almost a month and preferred to escape to the US than to do what he had promised, in the expectation that abroad the blow could happen because they funded people in Gate of the quarters to try to stimulate the blow. ”
 </p>
<p>
  Although it is exactly his description of Bolsonaro, Luiz Inácio Claudio consciously in the fight against coup. Although it does not save on the rank of the high military mandates who opened openly for the institutional rupture, the truth is that Luiz Inacio Apazigue views thick and conciliates with those for whom the armed forces should be spun of “democracy” - and therefore spun from its restriction or suspension.
 </p>
<p>
  Let's look at the current commander, Tomás Ribeiro Paiva, treated by Luiz Inacio as noble democratic figure. On January 18, 2023, ten days after the fateful January 8 - when hundreds of “green chickens” promoted invasion in the Praça dos Três Powers - the general was caught “analysis of the political situation” in a meeting with his subordinates. At the time, Thomas was a military commander of the Southeast.
 </p>
<p>
  In his exhibition, the general begins by evaluating the outcome of the elections: "Unfortunately it was the result that, for most of us, was unwanted but happened." Thomas argues that, despite this, we need to follow life.
 </p>
<p>
  Later, referring to January 8, he said: “Here the deplorable and unfortunate scenes. We gave the guy a tool to call a terrorist. ” The "guy" was Alexandre de Moraes, elected Archirrival for Bolsonaro himself. “This is vandal, this is crazy, it is expensive that has come into a fanatic spiral that does not support itself. What did you produce? Anything. The guy shit in the Supreme Chair. What does that change? Changes no fucking. ” Outraged, the general continues: “What a childish thing, dumb, they [the 'green chickens']
  <strong>
   have delivered a huge saved to a narrative that we are seeing that it is being established now
  </strong>
  ”. Later, he concludes: “On the 8th, we had an unacceptable event under any circumstances. Vandalism. Projected the negative image of Brazil in the world and, from a strategic point of view,
  <strong>
   Strengthens the opponent
  </strong>
  . Then it gave problem. ”
 </p>
<p>
  As it turns out, General Tomás Paiva, who won the notorious title of General Democrat by arguing that politics and barracks should not mix, does just that in his lecture. Why did you reveal your frustration with the fact that the "green chickens" have discredited the cause of military intervention, now called "terrorism" by this "huge narrative that is being established now"? Doesn't that look like an explicit political position of an active high officer - being a crime according to the military regulation? And after all, who is the opponent favored strategically? It would be the left - or what the general identifies as “left”? Now, but wouldn't the army be a "state institution", "apartisan"?
 </p>
<p>
  The current army commander goes further and complains about those who intended to occur military intervention at that time. “Impossible to do. We saw the consequences of this. You saw the worldwide repercussion. Imagine if we had taken it for an adventure? We would not survive as a country; The
  <strong>
   currency would explode
  </strong>
  . We were going to take a
  <strong>
   Economic blockade never seen
  </strong>
  . You were going to be an outcast, and our people were going to suffer the consequences. Would have
  <strong>
   blood on the street
  </strong>
  .
  <strong>
   Or you think the people were going to stay at home
  </strong>
  . It wasn't going to happen. We would dive the country into chaos. ” As can be noted, what moves its objection is not the defense of the noble cause of “democracy”, so loved by Tomás Ribeiro Paiva, but the lack of international support (
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/ex-chanceler-do-mexico-afirma-que-usa-persuadiram-militares-brasileiros-a-nao-unirem-se-a-bolsonaro-em-8-de-janeiro/">
   The US State Department had pronounced itself in April that it would not accept scam and would impose economic sanctions
  </a>
  ) and justification in the face of internal public opinion, or more exactly, fear of raising revolutionary resistance to total military intervention.
 </p>
<p>
  It remains to ask: What if these variables did not exist? Would Tomás Ribeiro Paiva and his "legalist" peers consider the hypothesis of dismissing a military coup now if the masses were undergravation and if he had the consent of the US State Department? Or would Tomás Ribeiro Paiva staged the role of Castelo Branco, the liberal ultrarectionary general who, in a week, swore loyalty to the government of Jango and, in the other, headed the first military government following the 1964 coup, which would later be swallowed by far right?
 </p>
<p>
  Luiz Inácio, committed to electorally polarizing Bolsonaro, is forgetting to take care of his own rear. More dangerous than Bolsonaro, they are the generals of the high command.

<p>
  On March 20, public servants in the municipality of Caieiras will carry out a general stoppage against salary reduction that reaches up to 20%. The mobilized servers will also perform a demonstration to the Caieiras City Hall, requiring improvements to the category.
 </p>
<p>
  With a many -year salary lag, Caieiras public servants at the end of February suffered another attack with the withdrawal of qualification bonus, which guaranteed an increase of 10% in the salaries of professionals with technical level and 20% to professionals with level higher. In response to the attacks, public servants mobilize to recover their rights.
 </p>
<p>
  As in Caieiras Public Servants of São Paulo also started their journey to fight the constant attacks, on strike since 13/03, public servants have held protests in front of the city that brought together thousands of workers. The tendency is for more municipalities to unify in strikes in defense of their salaries.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The Paris commune has conquered immortality as one of the most glorious pages of the international working class, being the first essay of the proletarian revolution and the taking of the political power of the State.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  On March 18, 1871, the working class and the Paris workers took arms abandoned by the Monarchical Army of Napoleon III, which had recently been defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. The second French empire, bastion of European reaction and obscurantism, was then the weakest link in the chain of domination of the oppressive classes against the proletariat. Here are some general notes that allow us to understand why.
 </p>
<ol>
<li>
   The second French empire formed after a coup d'etat of the monarchical army in the midst of the French political crisis. This is important because it tells us how the power of the bourgeoisie arose in the midst of restorations and counter-reclaimes amid hard class struggle between monarchy and bourgeoisie.
  </li>
<li>
   The monarchical-absolutist state was in an increasingly deep structural crisis amid its military defeats and the development of capitalism in Europe and the United States.
  </li>
<li>
   Within these military defeats, the people of Mexico can proudly count the copy of the National Liberation Fight against the Second French intervention, devised by Napoleon III who sought to strengthen politically and militarily the self -proclaimed “2nd Mexican empire” by Maximiliano de Habsburg with the support and money from European monarchies. The exemplary defense of the Peoples of Anahuac fighting in guerrilla columns next to the Republican Army of Juárez, Díaz, Zaragoza, Colonel Máximo Pineda and other outstanding characters in national history, managed to expel the invader in June 1867 after great battles such as the of May 5, 1862 in Puebla and on September 5, 1866 in Juchitán de Zaragoza, Oaxaca.
  </li>
<li>
   The Franco-Prussian war fought between two monarchical and warrior empires (France and Prussia, today Germany) between July 19, 1870 and May 10, 1871 deepened the crisis of the second French empire; The French bourgeoisie took power and restored the third republic in command of Adolfo Thiers, who continued the war without hearing the feeling of the soldiers emerged mostly from the working classes. The French army was defeated by the Germans in March 1871.
  </li>
<li>
   This was the unequivocal call that summoned the proletariat and the Parisian workers to take in their hands the torch of the proletarian revolution, expropriating the weapons abandoned by the French National Guard and recruiting for their cause the children of the working class dressed in military uniforms with military uniforms that aspired to peace, bread and freedom.
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="has-text-align-justify" p="">
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Terrified, the European monarchies and bourgeoisie understood that the Paris Commune contained within itself the germ of the destruction of private property in the means of production. Something that even the Prussian Empire agreed on. All of them, without exception, gave economic and military aid to the French monarchy and bourgeoisie to reorganize a White army with troops of their own and borrowed to crush the Commune. On May 21, 1871, the reactionary military counteroffensive began with more than 150,000 mercenary soldiers against a proud and defiant proletariat, which promptly erected barricades to fight street by street.
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Men, women, children, young and old, the entire proletariat rose up heroically and bravely like a veritable Red Army, striking back every blow and inflicting severe casualties on the White Army until the last barricade that managed to stand until May 28, 1871. It is estimated that the number of massacred is around 30,000 comrades, many of whose names have been lost to history. In his memory, and paying homage to 147 people shot in that place, the wall of the comuneros was built in the Pere-Lachaise Cemetery.
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   From the Paris Commune it is important to remember the great heroes of the proletariat, many of them members of the workers' government who were shot in the cemetery while shouting Long live the Commune!
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Today we want to highlight the fellow Eugene Pottier, worker poet, author of the most beautiful of the works of the literature entitled: La Internacional, which has been musicalized by another worker, Pierre Degeyter, and has become the hymn of war of the proletariat and oppressed peoples around the world.

   The Great Lenin tells us:
   <em>
    “This song has been translated into all the languages of Europe, and not just from Europe. Whatever the country in which a worker with class consciousness is, whatever the fate that fate will hold, no matter how much a stranger, without a language, without friends, far from his home country, can find comrades and friends, can find comrades and friends with the family chorus of the international ”.

   The peoples of Mexico must proudly know that our great national liberation struggle against the second French intervention is historically linked to the heroic struggle of the French proletariat, serving as an external factor for its triumph in March 1871.

<p>
  In a clearly persecutory process, the peasant leader Paulo Sérgio Costa de Araújo, one of the leaders of the Marielle Franco Community, was arrested on March 5, accused of being part of a "criminal organization", after denouncing torture against peasants and pointing out links between the civil and military police with the landowner Sidnei Sanches Zamora who, according to the peasants,  They have intensified their attacks on the land where the workers reside.
 </p>
<p>
  The peasants of the community, who live in the south of Amazonas, say that the agrarian conflict has intensified in the region in recent months, having suffered several attacks by gunmen in conjunction with civil and military police forces. The community is home to about 200 families, who began occupying the area in 2015.
 </p>
<p>
  Following the last offensive of the estate, where community leaders were kidnapped and tortured, Paulo Sérgio would have denounced to journalists not only torture and kidnapping, but also that the peasants would have caught Zamora in an illegal wood extraction scheme in the region.

<p>
  A few days after the cowardly attack, Paulo was arrested by order of Judge Danny Rodrigues Moraes, of the 1st District Court of Lábrea, accused of commanding a "criminal organization". In the text of the judicial decision that led to the arrest of the activist, the judge even stated, to justify the urgency of the arrest that: "(...) Paulo not only prepares for the invasion of the farm's posts, but also for the possibility of a possible massacre against the employees of the farm. (...) Paulo Sérgio is known for being 'busty', 'dangerous' and that 'he would have the courage to suckle on jaguars and leave the facts [sic] hungry'.
 </p>
<p>
  Before the arrest, however, in an interview with the Amazônia Real portal, the peasant leader said that Zamora would have great influence among the local authorities: "He [Sidnei Zamora] has an area of 10,400 hectares of pasture alone, but he does not want to give up the forest area. There, the farmer has a lot of influence peddling with the police of Boca do Acre [municipality in Amazonas], with the police of Acre," the activist said.

  About the community built by the peasants, the leader states: “He has the support of the authorities. And he has the greatest hatred for the name of our community to be Marielle Franco. There he is the owner of the situation. To register a complaint against him, no one can. ”
 </p>
<p>
  Paulo Sérgio still complements, reiterating his commitment to the righteous struggle for land: “Here is a city without law. Send who has money, obeys who does not have. Only I don't have [money] and I don't even want to obey. I will not obey the law of terror, ”he says.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the CPT's lawyer, Afonso Chagas, who attended the custody hearing where the indefinite detention was maintained: "We are prepared for everything, including that, if there is a denial in court, we immediately appeal to the Superior Court of Justice (STJ). Paulo is arrested for leading a criminal organization, that is, the people who fight for the right to land are criminalized again, when the land is public", concludes Afonso.
 </p>
<p>
  The superintendent of INCRA in Amazonas, Denis da Silva Pereira, reiterates that the area, in fact, belongs to the Union. According to him, after a cartographic study, INCRA identified that the area, which has about 48 thousand hectares, is within the Gleba Novo Natal and is vacant land.
 </p>
<p>
  The landowner in question, Zamora, who claims to be the owner of the land, would never have proven with any title the authorities in question, even being asked several times on the issue. The man, of São Paulo origin, would have declared in 2010, to have at least 3 farms in the Acre region and at least 30,000 heads of cattle, and even composed a landowner who traveled to China to increase the export of his “Green/ecosustainable meat” for the country.

<p>
</p>
<p>
   Young people, especially women, are being victims of a derogatory and stigmatizing label: "the ninis" (young people who neither study nor work); With this remote we are characterized by lazy, lazy, lazy ...
  </p>
<p>
   This narrative that persecutes us and points out is one of the many crimes of capital and, although it is not new, today is more frequent in family dinners, on social networks and in the media.
  </p>
<p>
   At the same time, this is an issue that young people do not speak, for two reasons: it is not well understood why our aspirations in this society fail; And because recognizing this failure is not easy and is painful. The ability to understand why capitalism frustrates our aspirations will acquire it after overcoming narcissistic subjectivism, which prevents us from studying reality.
  </p>
<p>
   According to a study by the Universidad del Rosario "Approximately 3 out of every 10 young Colombians between 18 and 29 years old are in the NEET group" This study also reveals that in the departments where unemployment, underemployment and reactionary war abound: Atlántico, Bolívar, Boyacá, Caldas, Caquetá, Casanare, Cauca, Cesar, Córdoba, Huila, Guajira,  In Magdalena, Meta, Nariño, Risaralda and Sucre, the percentage of women who neither study nor work exceeds 75% compared to men; which further aggravates their condition of subjection, and increases or creates greater risks to their lives.
  </p>
<p>
   Among the main reasons why young people do not have access to formal work or education are: low wages, precarious working conditions, temporary or hourly contracts, the terrible school education that the poorest receive in overcrowded public schools or colleges, the absence or little offer of public universities and university institutions, etc.  the high cost of the products necessary to sustain a student, the mental illnesses generated by the crises of capital, among others.
  </p>
<p>
   And this happens all over the world, but it is exacerbated in oppressed countries like ours, since capital needs an industrial reserve army, because thanks to this army it can lay off workers if they organize or stop production, since they have thousands of hands ready to take the abandoned place; Added to this, and it is something recurrent, it can make us fight for the same position, weakening the strength of our class.
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, this reserve army can link it to the armed forces that are at their service or criminal gangs, strengthening capitalist and imperialist businesses that benefit from drug trafficking.
  </p>
<p>
   All these conditions give oxygen to the overproduction of capital, increase the oppression over us, giving the imperialists and the national bourgeoisie magnanimous profits without the need to make large investments in education or technological development; In addition, encouraging young people who do manage to study to seek to migrate to another country that can guarantee them a better lifestyle, placing their knowledge and their labor force at the service of imperialism, building the rope with which they oppress their classmates.
  </p>
<p>
   And this is so, because the modern causes of unemployment in young people are related to the overproduction and automation of work that displaces work force and displaces the young people of the working class towards misery, since the intensity of our work increases, and at the same time closes jobs.
  </p>
<p>
   But this is not to say, in any sense, that technological advances are to blame; No, the main problem lies in the fact that this technology is not at the service of our class, far from it – as some nationalists would say – because of the link to the productive sector of poor migrants, which displaces the local workforce. No, these migrants are our classmates and the enemy is capital that uses them against our interests.
  </p>
<p>
   Imperialism, in alliance with the Colombian bourgeoisie, imposes policies that have turned our country into an industrial complex in which only cheap labor is bought, mainly young; In which, in the division of international labor, it is the production of psychotropics, the extracted of natural resources, where education only seeks speech and submission, leaving us few options. All these policies only benefit the bourgeoisie.
  </p>
<p>
   But before this panorama, what to do? In the first place, it is necessary that youth be thought of political organization as the basis and the principle of the transformation of its reality, to go to collective action from revolutionary youth organizations, to the party organization. Fundamental then for this, it is to know at what stage the revolution is in Colombia, and this begins to accept that there is no truly revolutionary party that organizes the people in search of popular power, so the young people who are affected must be added to the efforts of the Communist Workers Union (MLM) for the creation of the Revolutionary Party in Colombia.
  </p>
<p>
   Secondly, understanding that the armed struggle is not the struggle of a small group of men and women who decide to make small blows. No, it is the people's fight in arms, led by their party. The party sends to weapons, and the interests of the masses monitor, press, compose and finance the party.
  </p>
<p>
   And the armed struggle is not a whim, it responds to the awareness that the only possible way to defeat our enemies is by non -peaceful means. Therefore it is essential that young people begin to seriously investigate the reason for the failure of the guerrillas of our country, the experiences of the popular survey of 2021 and the subsequent overflow of the revolutionary struggle, and mainly requires that we study the
   <em>
    Program for the Revolution in Colombia, the Military Line for the Revolution in Colombia and the Mass Line
   </em>
   of the Communist Workers Union (MLM).
  </p>
<p>
   We must create cells and those cells must be disciplined in the study, which is the one that guides the practice, and the practice is the one that complements the study. Time is short and the strongest, skillful and great minds of our class are needed to deepen the successes and correct errors.
  </p>
<p>
   We, the youth, must organize the revolution, and this can only be achieved by concentrating all forces against the main enemies of the people, learning from the revolution together with the masses, proving in the heat of the struggle who does accompany us on this hard and just path of the transformation of society and the construction of a new tomorrow.
  </p>
<h5 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">

   Although at first glance the march of the International Women's Day seems to be dominated by bourgeois feminism, it is necessary and very important to mention that a part of the 8M mobilization in Bogotá was attended by a differentiating factor. Combativity and belligerence cannot be denied, the challenging attitude in their voices and the numerous assistance of women who left from the Ministry of Labor to the Plaza de Bolívar, however, the limitations that to this movement that to this movement cannot be denied It imposes bourgeois feminism.

   During the march of March 8 in Bogotá, a small but significant block of women and men could be seen manifesting with a combative and revolutionary character, in which activists of the workers' revolution also participated. With slogans that go beyond the just demands in general against patriarchy, against violence, femicides, abuse, beyond the demands of equality and some choirs against men; The speech of this block recalled that the capitalist system is the cause of oppression to women and made the call for women's claims to aim against the double exploitation suffered by workers, economic freedom, the recognition of their work Also at home, the political participation of women independently and especially for the organization of their struggle in a revolutionary female movement.
  </p>
<p>
   From the independent bloc convened by activists of the Revolutionary Women's Movement (MFR) it was recalled that women for their emancipation must march under the red flag of the proletariat, that proletarian women are willing to continue in the organized struggle, the memory of Palestinian women murdered by Zionism and imperialism was recalled, as well as that of important revolutionaries such as Bathsheba Espinal and Clara Zetkin,  among others. At the same time, she handed out a considerable amount of written propaganda, almost the only one seen at the march, which included the MFR's Platform of Struggle, as a proposal for unity in the organization of the Women's Committees.
  </p>
<p>
   Another of the elements that highlighted this block was the participation of men; The men who share in practice the struggle of women from their position of husbands, children, parents, couples, fighting companions and mainly, like their class brothers. This participation, until now vetoed by feminism, also highlights the importance of the fight must be elbow between men and women, while demarcating a new trend in these mobilizations.
  </p>
<p>
   Undoubtedly, the participation of this red component in the march of the city, is a great advance in the construction of another type of female movement and demonstrates the need for a revolutionary direction for it. The call is to form women's committees in all regions and in all sectors, the flag of women's emancipation must be lifted and directed by the labor movement, remembering that it is precisely in this movement where it has the origins this commemoration. So, this task is raised to proletarian women, but also to students, peasants and all women in the popular sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   We greet from here those workers who welcomed the call and set out to organize participation in the march and motivate them to continue this work, because we know that very soon, this embryo of the new revolutionary female movement demonstrated in Bogotá, will grow in the main Cities and villages of the country, we can see red blocks in all marches and both slogans, as the flags will become a flow of flows of thousands of women for their emancipation of oppression and exploitation of capital and against imperialist capitalism.

     The Paris Commune, proclaimed on March 18, 1871, represents a significant chapter in the history of the workers' movement. It was the first social rehearsal of the revolutionary proletariat to seize political power, unleashing a civil war against the exploiters, establishing an embryonic form of direct workers' democracy. Not only was it a significant revolutionary action in itself, but it also provided a practical model for the future of the proletarian struggle.

     This government emerged spontaneously during the Franco-Prussian war, as a response to general discontent against the bourgeoisie, which had triggered war and exercised a mediocre defense of the homeland. The commune was chosen on March 26 and proclaimed two days later, implementing policies to meet the immediate needs of the laborious masses and dissolving the old state of the exploiters.

     The measures adopted by the commune included the abolition of the permanent army and the police, the democratic and revocable election of the officials with workers' salaries, and the separation of the Church and the State. These acts demonstrated how the masses solved in practice the problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a dictatorship for the oppressive classes, with the democratic exercise of the exploited and oppressed masses.

     The Commune-type state is characterized as a new type of state that negates the bourgeois state. Their power comes from the direct initiative of the masses from below, replacing the repressive institutions with the general arming of the people and replacing the bureaucracy with electable and removable officials. It serves the proletariat as the ruling class to exercise its dictatorship over the former oppressors and exploiters, but at the same time, it is the beginning of the negation of any state.

     The women, since the beginning of the revolution on March 18, were fundamental in the defense of the city, facing government troops and demonstrating their firmness not only in support work, but with weapons in the barricades; especially during the last week. The women of the commune were not limited to a traditional "feminist movement", but were actively involved as workers and this could be seen in the organization of committees, clubs, cooperatives, such as the Union of Women for the defense of Paris founded by Louise Michel.

     The military defeat of the commune occurred thanks to the alliance of the Prussian forces that helped to fence the city and the forces of Thiers that were nourished by the liberation of the prisoners in the hands of Prussia, defeat helped by the naive benevolence of the leaders workers who did not take the rapid and urgent measures to “expropriate the expropriators” as was the Bank of France, measures that gave the necessary time and the resources for the reaction to be lifted and joined internationally.

     Despite its fall on May 28, 1871, the commune of Paris left historical teachings that still guide the praxis of the revolutionary detachments of the working class and its real parties. The lessons of the commune are mandatory and their understanding and application is decisive for the communists in the world, especially after the experiences of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia and China and its temporary defeat.

  Referring to those made to the Palestinian flags, the pennants of the YDG and the Union of Struggle, and especially the hate attacks revealed by the Lubuni, YDG said, “Determining an attitude on the Istanbul Newrozu held in Yenikapı, and the necessary criticisms on our experiences and direct experiences It is a necessity in the dimension of events to do and take a self -critical attitude. ”
 </p>
<p>
  The continuation of YDG's statement titled iz Our evaluation of what happened in Istanbul Yenikapı Newrozu ”is as follows:
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   ‘The day full of enthusiasm and hope was wanted to be overshadowed by provocations’
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  “It is necessary to discuss a number of important issues from the Palestinian flags to the flams of our institution and the Union of Struggle, and especially the hate attacks that are revealed to the lubunias. We will try to summarize all of them by setting up the issues in place.
 </p>
<p>
  All of the statements made so far, including the statement of the Newroz Organizing Committee, regarding this process, which started with hate attacks against LGBTI+s and did not stop until almost the end of the rally, are inadequate and have a content that is limited to each institution's own place and experiences, and does not see its own responsibilities. The issue boils down to the provocations of a group calling themselves National Kurds, a very small minority in the rally. However, the problem is much more rooted ideologically and practically than this, despite the fact that this group has engaged in endless provocations wherever they go.
 </p>
<p>
  Newroz on the day of resistance of the oppressed with the broadest participation and enthusiasm compared to the past years has been the target of direct and indirect attacks of the system. This enthusiastic and hopeful day was wanted to be overshadowed by provocations.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   ‘Inadequacy has opened a historical wound in all of us’
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The aggression of the rally in the area of the LGBTI+s in the area with the rainbow and trance flags of the national Kurds initiated hate attacks on LGBTI+s, and these attacks in the rally by taking into consideration many Kurdish young people independent of this group, the crime grew. As soon as the attacks begin, few officials from the Organizing Committee, YDG, Partizan, SMF, Halkevleri, BDSP, EKA, December feminist collective activists and young people from young to older people developed a hundreds of patriotic, ownership attitudes and attackers. tried to prevent. However, the fact that hundreds of people were barricaded against aggressive groups during the process was not enough to keep LGBTI+safely in the field and could not end psychological and physical attacks. As a matter of fact, the fact that LGBTI +'s had to abandon their own Newroz areas in this way, such a helpless and insufficiency of those who advocate LGBTI+has opened a historical wound in all of us.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   ‘The Passing Committee and the Patriotic Movement of the Patriotic Movement’
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The fact that the Organizing Committee and the patriotic movement did not address the problem in an organized manner despite the hate attacks that came to light and that they passed over as quietly as possible is the source of the failure to prevent these attacks and to create a safe space.
 </p>
<p>
  While LGBTI ’+lasa hate attitude continued on one side, those who carry Palestinian flags in many points in the rally faced the threatening discourses of small small groups, and the Palestinian flags were tried to be downloaded. In this chaotic and tense environment, the pennants of the Union of Struggle in the Turkish Revolutionary Movement leaders of the Turkish Revolutionary Movement of Deniz Gezmiş, which is supposedly burned on the hostility of Kemalism and the so -called cases of “Kurdishness” on the same fire, this Turkish state collaborator group by the group of trans and rainbow flags by the group side by side For our Kurdish name on which our name was written on it.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   ‘Collaborative Group Provocations Responsible’
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  It is responsible for the provocations that the collaborative group of M. Kemal, who should call them national Kurds with their actions and collaborative attitudes, but should call them the Unionist Kurds in the region in which they are located in the region where they are located. In these provocations, those who actually involve the accounts are among the ones that will be accountable, but there is a order that they should wait at the moment. Our anger, hatred, hands and eyes are on our primary enemy that organizes these hostile attacks. Every other hostility towards the public has to wait for the order of formation from the Turkish judge classes to a fundamental way, changing this order depends on the activities of these collaborative groups.
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
<strong>
    ‘We are a problem that we are trying to give, but we cannot, but we will give self -criticism’
   </strong>
</p>
<p p="">
<p>
<strong>
     ‘We have to grow up with every social subject and create opportunities for organizing’
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The choice here is not simply whether or not to create spaces, but the future is everywhere being built by those who raise the line of resistance of today. LGBTI+s are escalating the struggle to establish their existence and identity, and the future will inevitably result in the acceptance of this, everyone will have to renew themselves by adapting to it. The question now is whether to be on the side of what is to come, to fight against the dominant system, its status quo and its building blocks, and to grow and renew with it. It is full of examples of the decline of the Turkish revolutionary movement, and especially of our organization, by not being able to overcome the blockage experienced by those who have conservatively stepped on the same memorization with its historical past. If we want to move forward and achieve our goals, we have to grow with every social subject that meets resistance and create opportunities for organization.
   </p>
<p>
    As in the case of Yenikapi Newroz, reconciling with the back offers a massive ground to provocation attacks, which cannot be prevented from the attacks. When the work reaches this point, it does not even need to be at that point of the Turkish state itself.
   </p>
<p>
    Although all this and the attacks have not been prevented, the fact that the provocations come across the self -reaction of the mass wherever they go and the mass reaction, the strongest grounds of the struggle against the system are, and how large the tendency of the mass is to the right. The place and hope we need to return to our direction are here.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     ‘We invite the Kurdish National Freedom Movement and the Organization Committee to give a more consistent self -criticism’
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, we did not succeed in preventing the provocational attacks in this Newroz, but we are aware that the state will not stop in this regard, and as long as we succeed in educating and advancing the ideological struggle, ourselves and the masses, through possible contradictions, beyond simply demanding violent accountability, its provocations, whatever their form, will result in an attempt. Otherwise, the masses, who are instrumental in the crimes of sworn collaborators, whose numbers are very, very few, will not be able to be drawn from the wrong path they are in. Regardless of ideological and political progress, only violence and attempts to prevent it at the time of the incident are instrumental in tightening and interlocking the provocative line holders. For this reason, in order to distinguish between those who build the wrong path and those who enter it by mistake, we need to put before us a long-term and multifaceted ideological struggle, and other means of struggle must be added to it.
   </p>
<p>
    At all these points, it gives our self -criticism in terms of our responsibilities, especially LGBTI+'s target of the attack, which has become the target of the attack in every field, expressing that we will continue to be with the Kurdish National Freedom Movement and the Organizing Committee in terms of its own responsibilities We invite you to give.

  Federal Education Minister Bettina Stark-Watzinger sees schools in Germany, who is responsible for preparing young people for the war. "Overall, society has to prepare well for crises - from a pandemic to natural disasters to war",
  <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/krieg-schule-vorbereitung-katastrophenschutz-stark-watzinger-1.6466076">
   postulated the FDP politician
  </a>
  About the Funke media group. “Civil protection is immensely important, it also belongs to schools. The goal must be to strengthen our resistance. "

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  According to the government's will, even the youngest children are now to be subjected to paramilitary lessons in the study of the enemy and trained in appropriate defensive measures. "Knowing the threats to freedom and dealing with the dangers" is what modern liberal politician German calls today. According to Stark-Watzinger's will, this should not yet become a separate school subject, but rather learning content.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  What exactly this means for schools remains unclear, because school lessons are actually not a matter of the federal government, but the countries. However, the advances towards more centralization, that is, more power and powers for the federal government, less for the countries, are clear in all possible aspects. Federalism in itself is an obstacle to German imperialism in its striving to develop into a superpower, imposed by the western Allies after the Second World War.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  But even in the countries you are not idle on this front. The Bavarian state government is already planning to make the school attendance of youth officers binding as part of a change in the law. Simplified, the German soldiers specially trained for this should take over the tasks of political education in the lessons and, for example, explain which tasks of the Bundeswehr. It is particularly important that this has nothing to do with recruits, because the Bundeswehr career consultants and not the youth officers are responsible for this.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  The former State Secretary for Integration in North Rhine -Westphalia and today's member of the Bundestag Serap Güler from the CDU

   the fanfares sound
  </a>
  . With her faction colleague Kerstin Vieregge, she presented a so -called concept paper for the Bundeswehr. The two Union politicians call for mandatory school visits to youth officers from the 9th grade. But not only that. In addition, every student should have seen a barracks from the inside once in his school days.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  The NRW-FDP also wants the youth officers to stir the drum much more often at schools. For the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group, Marc Lürbke, the only question is whether this happens with coercion or "voluntary". In contrast to his colleagues, Lürbke, however, becomes clear in a different aspect: In any case, the Bundeswehr has to get more opportunities in addition to participating in the lessons.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  Teachers 'unions and also student representatives generally oppose the initiative of the militarization of the schools, but the German Teachers' Association explicitly had explicitly in school lessons immediately after the plans of the Federal Minister of Education.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  "The Ukraine War creates a new awareness of military threats, which must also be conveyed in schools," said Association President Stefan Düll. “I expect the Federal Minister to now seek a conversation with the educational ministers in the federal states. A declaration of intent is not enough, now in political lessons on the Ukraine War and the pan-European, even global threat situation, must be taught. ”A clear announcement, not only for a military customer 2.0, but unacided concrete preparations for a new case Barbarossa.

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  Of course, all this is also happening in the light of the fact that the number of temporary and professional soldiers, as well as voluntary conscripts, has not been able to

  . There are currently around 180,000 active German soldiers, and by 2031 this number is expected to rise to well over 200,000. But the recruitment of young talent by the German army is apparently not progressing.

  Campaign Against State Repression (CASR) Press Conference cum Public Gathering on Political Prisoners and Wrongful Incarceration of Hem Mishra, GN Saibaba, Pandu Narote Prashant Rahi, Mahesh and Vijay Tirki
 </h2>
<p>
  On 18th March 2024, Campaign Against State Repression (CASR), a joint platform of 35+ organizations celebrated the ‘International Day of Solidarity with Political Prisoners’ by holding a public gathering cum press conference titled “Life in
  <em>
   You
  </em>
  Cell: Political Prisoners and Wrongful Incarcerations” at Press Club of India, Delhi. The event was to mark the acquital and prison experience of cultural activist Hem Mishra and his family, after the Bombay High Court’s verdict cleared him of all charges along with Delhi University professor Dr. GN Saibaba, journalist Prashant Rahi, Adivasi activists Vijay Tirki, Mahesh Tirki and Pandu Narote. The event started with 2 minutes of silence for Pandu Narote who died in prison due to neglect of his medical conditions by the authorities at the young age of 33.
 </p>
<p>
  From Delhi University’s department of political science and member of Forum Against Corporatization and Militarization (FACAM), Dr. Saroj Giri started the conference by pointing out how the arrests and imprisonment of political prisoners like Hem Mishra is not a matter of legal victories or individual political parties. Instead, Giri believes that it is because Hem Mishra raised the issues of corporate loot of natural resources, displacement of Adivasis, caste-based oppression and the exploitation of workers and peasants, that he was imprisoned. Saroj Giri said, “the electoral bonds case has exposed that all parties trying to maintain the facade of electoral democracy are allies in using the labour of workers and the resources of Chhattisgarh as ATMs for their class rule. Voices like Hem Mishra who opposed this were silenced.”
 </p>
<p>
  Hem Mishra’s father, Mr. K.D. Mishra spoke next, discussing the experience of Hem’s family during the ordeal of his false incarcerations. He discussed how legal procedures were violated when his son was abducted by the police and how his disability was ignored. He discussed how his son was always interested in fighting for the interests of the people. He said, “my son has a disability that restricts the usage of his hand. We made a lot of effort to get it treated when he was young but in jail, even getting him medicine was difficult. All we heard was that our son was a Naxalite, a Maoist which supposedly made him worse than any other criminal. My wife said he was fighting for the interests of the people and was fighting for a noble cause but it took a long time for me to accept it.”
 </p>
<p>
  St. Stephen’s College, DU professor and ex-Delhi University Teachers Union (DUTA) President Dr. Nandita Narain brought up how even those who defended the interests of political prisoners, like Prof. Hany Babu who was a member of the Committee for the Defense and Release of G.N. Saibaba and Rona Wilson of the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP) who both find themselves in prison under the charges of being associated with the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) under the fabricated Bhima Koregaon-Elgaar Parisha case. She also argued that merely carrying Maoist literature and raising the demand for Jal-Jangal-Jameen (Our Water, Our Forest, Our Land) does not make one liable for arrest under UAPA. She said, “we are students, scholars, educators. Reading and carrying Maoist literature is no crime but our right, for we must study all thoughts, ideologies and philosophies and come to our understanding.”
 </p>

   Hem Mishra talked further of how he was continuously moved from one jail to another, making lawyers inaccessible to him and draining his family of its limited finances by forcing them to find new lawyers in different jurisdictions. Inside the closed
   <em>

   cell’s spartan conditions where political prisoners are often kept in isolation, even the jail staff appealed to the police authorities and judges to remove Hem out of the

    Hem’s mother spoke next, tearfully bringing up her ordeal during his incarceration. She said, “we are people of the Himalayas. We did not come here to have our son be labeled a terrorist and an enemy of the state. I am only happy that the decade of harassment has ended.”
   </p>
<p>
    Veteran lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan addressed the press next, highlighting how agencies like the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have been given extra-legal impunity under the current government to criminally loot the country and file fabricated cases against activists who fight against all this. “Political prisoners are stuck in this situation due to the draconian UAPA law being used against them where bail becomes an exception and jail becomes the rule, even when one is not guilty,” he said.
   </p>
<p>
    Democratic rights activist Devika Menon followed suit, condemning draconian laws like UAPA and upholding the demand for release of all political prisoners. She harkened back to United Nations resolutions and covenants which guarantee rights to political prisoners but have not been realised in Indian society. She recalled the words of Prof. R.S. Rao, adding, “rights are determined by people and for the people. They cannot be conditional in a country claiming to be a democracy.”

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024. CURRENT:  15 FEBRUARY - 15 MARCH 2024             2.13M 95% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 677,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 876,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 578,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 96,000 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security PROJECTED:  16 MARCH - 15 JULY 2024             2.23M 100% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 1,107,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 854,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 265,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 0 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security    IPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY ANALYSIS   15 FEBRUARY - 15 JULY 2024   Published on 18 March 2024IPC Global Initiative - Special Brief IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC global initiative and do not necessarily reflect the views of stakeholders in Palestine. This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action. This is because some households may be in Phase 2 or even 1 but only because of receipt of  assistance, and thus, they may be in need of continued action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1. Missions planned, facilitated and denied, October 2023 to Mid-February 2024. Source: OCHA Map 2. Distribution of IDPs staying in Collective  Centres. Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men. Some women are now resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, such as scavenging for food under rubble  or in dumpsters.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF16Area Governorate % of total Gaza populationURB LZ SAG LZ % of governorate HHs with kcal gaps indicative  of IPC 5 % of area (northern/southern) with kcal gaps  indicative of IPC 5Estimated % of population in the LZ  (URB) Very Poor (24% of the LZ population)  Survival Deficit (SD), Indicative IPC Phase Poor (33%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (41%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (4%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Estimated % of population in the LZ  (SAG) Very Poor (32%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Poor (37%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (25%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (7%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024)Northern Gaza North Gaza5% 100%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 50% N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 100,0%Gaza5% 94%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 56%86%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 584%,  Phase 549%,  Phase 4100%Southern Gaza Deir al Balah (or  middle Gaza)10% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferred To be inferred based on Khan Younis and Deir al Balah assumptions  and convergence of other data higlighting where and to what  extent conditions resemble Rafah vs. Northern GazaKhan  Younis21% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferredRafah59% 97%33%  survival  deficit,  Phase 432%  survival  deficit,  Phase 445%  survival  deficit,  Phase 427%  survival  deficit,  Phase 43%13%  survival  deficit,  100%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival  deficit,  89%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10% survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10,0% SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024)simulation -  Rafah invasion 59% 97%67% 64% 63% 54% 3%42% 31% 0% 0%  Phase 5 Phase  5 Phase 5 Phase  5Phase 4 Phase 4 Phase 1 Phase 1<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF17 NUTRITION SITUATION Inadequate dietary intake According to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster in December  2023-January 2024,61 in North Gaza, 98 percent of the children (47 observations) included in the analysis had consumed  two or fewer food groups in the 24 hours preceding the survey. Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18.

Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

Source: Various - reanalysis  conducted by the Global Smart Team<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF27 Mortality The analysis could not benefit from representative evidence of non-trauma mortality as intended by IPC Protocols (Crude  Death Rate and Under Five Death Rate). The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah. The wider  besiegement of the Gaza Strip would intensify.Conflict would rapidly escalate, including  the onset of a new, wide-ranging, and large- scale ground operation throughout Rafah  Governorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  intense and frequent armed actor clashes, and  a large increase in bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip would  intensify. Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion. This collapse  would heavily constrain humanitarian operations  through reducing access and inhibiting the ability  to conduct critical activities like distributions,  especially to the most vulnerable population  groups. The United Nations presence within the  Gaza Strip, including offices and storage facilities,  would be particularly impacted, including by  violence and looting. The loss of social cohesion  would involve the loss of most remaining socially- based coping, such as receiving food or cash  through social networks outside of immediate  family.Already strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and  a wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information.

       Ten 
  prison police officers were arrested on charges of 
 torture, abuse of office and abuse of authorities on two prisoners in prison 
  of Foggia
      </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
      Two prisoners would have been pounded 
 On 11 August 2023 in the prison of Foggia. After the beatings, according to what 
  emerged from the investigations of the prosecutor, the arrested agents would have 
 predisposed and signed deeds
      <span>

</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
     false aimed at hiding the 
 violence carried out and to prevent hospital diagnosis from being issued 
  for the injuries reported by the two prisoners. For this reason, the ten 
 agents in question are also accused of omission of office deeds, 
 damage, bribery, ideological falsehood committed by an audience 
 official in public documents, suppression, destruction and concealment of 
 real acts.
     <p>
</p>
<p>
      During the investigations they would also have been accepted too 
 threats and promises of retaliation through which the suspects 
 they would have forced the victims to sign false minutes of 
 declarations in which they provided a very different version of the facts from 
 the one then ascertained by the investigations. The arrested agents would have done 
  so that the two victims, despite having reported obvious injuries after 
 the violence, they attest to having injured themselves in other ways and that there is no 
 had been no aggression by the authorities within the 
 Prison of Foggia.
     </p>
<p>
      The ten arrested agents are currently in precautionary custody 
 in prison and everyone must answer, in various capacities, torture, abuse 
 of authority, abuse of office and omission of office deeds, as well as 
 of suppression, concealment and destruction of real acts.

<strong>
   På 8. mars forsøkte provokatører i Oslo og i Sandefjord å bruke arbeiderkvinnenes internasjonale kampdag til å støtte folkemordet staten Israel begår i Gaza.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In Oslo, a pro-Israeli group showed up to spread charges of abuse against Israeli women of the Palestinian national resistance movement. This is nothing but an attempt to legitimize the Gaza genocide, by dehumanizing the Palestinians and portraying them as animals that must be eradicated to secure the state of Israel. They spread the same old reactionary notion that it is not right to rebel. This provocation was confronted and

  </a>
  of hundreds of 8 Marstog participants.
 </p>
<p>
  In Sandefjord, two people showed up with an Israeli flag. It has been reported that they were confronted and stopped. The Zionist flag was seized and lit by masses. According to reports from bourgeois media and pro-Israeli groups, one of the provocateurs was beaten and kicked by several people. He was then sent to the hospital in Tønsberg, where he had to be one day with great head and neck pain - according to those who support the Gaza genocide, this was a "brutal attack".
 </p>
<p>
  What is the most "brutal," allegedly knocking up a reactionary pro-Israeli activist, or killing more than 31,000 people, including more than 12,000 children?

   Every hour
  </a>
  siden 7. oktober er 15 personer drept i Gaza – seks av dem barn og 12 bygninger er blitt ødelagt. Dette skjer fortsatt, og palestinerne blir presset inn i en mer og mer desperat situasjon. Befolkningen på Gaza blir tvangsforflyttet til et mindre og mindre område, under tung israelsk bombing og beleiring, med en økende desperat mangel på mat og rent drikkevann. Barn har allerede begynt å dø av sult og alt peker frem på et kommende sprang i omfanget av folkemordet, eller en tvangsforflytning av befolkningen i Gaza til Egypt.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialistene kommer ikke til å gjøre noe for å stoppe folkemordet. Deres internasjonale lover, definisjoner av krigsforbrytelser og forbrytelser mot «menneskeheten», er ikke verdt papiret de er skrevet på, så fort de ikke tjener imperialistenes egne interesser. Støtte til det palestinske folket og fordømmelse av folkemordet blir slått hardt ned på av imperialistiske stater og lakei-statene deres i den tredje verden, til og med i de arabiske landene.
 </p>
<p>
  Yankee-imperialismen er den politiske, økonomiske og militære hovedstøtten til folkemordet, og det er deres interesser staten Israel i hovedsak tjener. Russisk imperialisme vil fokusere på sin angrepskrig mot Ukraina og de vil unngå en regional krig i Midtøsten. Kinesisk imperialisme vil forsøke å dempe den tilspissede situasjonen i Rødehavet, ettersom Jemens angrep mot Israel og imperialistene er en trussel mot de kinesiske økonomiske interesser. Tysk imperialisme, som til ingens overraskelse gir full støtte til folkemord, har etablert Israels sikkerhet som Tysklands «raison d’état» – et juridisk begrep som betyr at dette spørsmålet står over alle statens lover og all moral. Norsk imperialisme er tilsluttet krigen på Israelsk side, gjennom sin militære deltakelse i imperialismens operasjoner i Rødehavet, og den bidrar politisk til folkemordet ved å fordømme den palestinske motstanden.
 </p>
<p>
  The Lacei regimes in Palestine's neighboring countries, and several other Arab countries where the people show tremendous support and solidarity with the Palestinian people, has no more than empty words to support what Palestine. Several of them hit hard on solidarity demonstrations, such as Jordan, where the rulers use

   tear gas
  </a>
  And rebel police against the people to protect the Israeli embassy. Egypt does the same, and is also involved in the blockade of Gaza. The Israel-excited Quisling Government in the West Bank led by Mahmoud Abbas has even shot Palestinian masses protesting against the Gaza genocide. Their crimes against the people include
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/palestinian-authority-cracks-down-on-protests-over-israel-gaza-attacks">
   The murder of 12 -year -old Razan Nasrallah
  </a>
  , which was shot by the forces of "the Palestinian autonomous authorities".
 </p>
<p>
  The Palestinian people continue their heroic resistance after decades of Israeli siege of what has become the world's largest concentration camp. The Palestinian armed national resistance front continues the military fight against the occupier. Israel has not been able to destroy the fighting will of the Palestinian people or their armed forces. Northern Israel and Israeli goals in the occupied Golan heights are constantly shot with racks of Lebanese Hezbollah. The Government of Yemen, called the "Houthi militia" by the imperialists, strikes hard battles against Israel and imperialism in the Red Sea. The world's people and especially the Arab people support the Palestinian people with powerful solidarity markings and actions.
 </p>
<p>
  International Communist Federation - IKF writes the following in its statement in support of the Palestinian People's Invincible Armed National Resistance Camp October 8, 2023:
 </p>
<p>
  "No cruelty or terror from the State of Israel will be able to stop the heroic resistance, but will increase the wrath of the world's people, who will rise to fight them until they are drowned in the sea.
  <strong>
   Dare to fight, dare to win! ”
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The anger of the world's people cannot be tamed, and will only grow stronger as long as the state of Israel continues to develop its genocide in Gaza. Should one feel safe if you publicly support or legitimize genocide? Should those who politically, economically or military contribute to genocide feel safe? The world's people will not forget the crimes committed by the imperialists and their lackeys! No resistance to this genocide is for "brutal"!
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   It is right to rebel!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Proletarer, verdens undertrykte folk og nasjoner, foren dere og kjemp mot imperialismen og alle dens lakeier!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Dead over the intruder! Live the Palestinian people's armed national resistance struggle!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Ned med den imperialistiske krigen! Leve de nasjonale frigjøringskampene!
  </strong>

Israeli on Gaza, in the Meloni government the voices of those who would like to
 Use the opportunity to impose

     A repressive vine tour also within the universities

    . The Minister of the Interior
    <strong>
     Piantedosi
    </strong>
    In fact, he would have developed a plan that provides for "limited and 
 controlled "to the universities and to place the police at the entrance 
 of the classrooms where conferences and appointments are held to block the 
 disputes. The indiscretion follows the very hard statements of the 
 Minister of Agriculture, as well as brother -in -law of Giorgia Meloni, Francesco 
 Lollobrigida, which declared none other than a "excess of 
 tolerance »towards disputes could lead to risks 
 terrorist in the country.
   </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    Do not take measures against episodes such as that of Naples,
    <strong>
     in fact he declared Lollobrigida,
    </strong>
    "in the past
    <strong>
     then led to terrorism
    </strong>
    and its reinforcement up to the episode of Aldo Moro, who, with his 
sacrifice, created such a broad democratic alarm that it allowed us to
 to defeat the brutal phenomenon of subversion." Nevertheless 
the juxtaposition of the events seems fanciful, to say the least, the Viminale 
He would already be running for cover. To trigger the concern of the 
government

</a>
   In fact, they would be a series of meetings that should be held 
in Italian universities in the coming days and which could be 
strongly contested by the "pro-Palestine front" and against Israel. For 
That reason, according to the rumours made public by the
   <em>
    Corriere della Sera
   </em>
   , the government would be assumed more stringent security measures
   <strong>
    on classroom entrances
   </strong>
   where the meetings will have to be held, which from now on could 
 also be placed under the lens of the provincial committees for order e 
  public safety in the Prefecture, as well as the nonsense and of the 
 Relative technical tables. Given the non -predictable character of these types 
 of protests, then, could be
   <strong>
    surveillance before conferences increased
   </strong>
   , 
  hypothesis that heralds the presence of contingents of the forces 
 of the order to preside over the classrooms. For its part, the minister 
 of the Anna Maria Bernini University braked the hypothesis advanced by 
 Viminale, but he convened a meeting with the rectors for the next 
 Thursday, to agree with them the methods of repression of 
 protests.
   <p>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    If the measures were to be put in place 
practice, we would be faced with yet another attempt at this 
government to trivialize protests and social demands. The 
"pro-Palestine front" thus becomes a label that transforms into a
    <strong>

 With the mass of hundreds of people, mainly students, this morning in the courts, solidarity with the 49 arrests of Saturday, was held in the courts, despite being Clean Monday.
 <br>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The terror effort continued today. Dozens of police officers were in front of the courthouse gates, blocking almost anyone who tried to enter the courts to see their own people, with the exception of only a few (!) parents, after being scrutinized. It is clear that they are trying to create a climate of terror and persecution against students fighting to overturn the law.
 </p>
<p>
  The gathering was attended by Student Associations, organizations and collectives of Thessaloniki and slogans were heard against the persecutions, for the overthrow of the Pierrakakis law against which students have been fighting for 2 and a half months.
 </p>
<p>
  Students released you early in the afternoon, followed by a dynamic course in the city center that ended up in the FA. The trial got postponement for the end of March.
 </p>
<p>
  They do not terrorize us!
 </p>
<p>
  We continue the struggle for the overthrow of Pierrakakis law through our student clubs!

   Gadchiroli District, March 19, 2024:
  </strong>
  Four cadres of the CPI (Maoist), including Mangi-Indravelli Area Committee secretary Vargeesh from Telangana, were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in Kolamarka hillocks under Aheri tehsil of Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district early on Tuesday.
 </p>
<p>
  Police had credible intelligence inputs that some members of the CPI (Maoist) Telangana State committee have crossed Pranahita river to carry out subversive activities ahead of the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, police sources revealed to the press today.
 </p>
<p>
  Joint teams of local police and the Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF) Quick Action Team personnel launched a search operation in Kolamarka forest area late on Monday. One of the team members came under fire from the Maoists, leading to an exchange of fire in Kolamarka hillocks in the early hours of the day, police sources stated.

  : “In the early hours of Tuesday, our teams came under indiscriminate fire from cadres of the Maoist party while conducting a search operation in the Kolamarka mountains near Repanpalli, which promoted a response from our men.”
 </p>
<p>
  The bodies of four Maoists were recovered and an AK-47, a carbine, two country-made pistols, Maoist literature, and other items were seized from the spot, the Gadchiroli SP commented.

  It will take place today, March 19, the judgment of the request for the defense of the popular activists for annulment of the processes. Motivated by the existence of evidence produced by an illegal infiltration, the appeal occurred after the first instance of the 23 political processes of the June 2013 days and the fight against the World Cup in 2014.
 </p>
<p>
  Popular movements, class organizations and lawyers entities report that illegal evidence has not yet been taken from the process. As part of the complaint, a demonstration is being called at 13h in front of the trial, the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice.
 </p>
<p>
  One of the calls for the demonstration, carried out by the Brazilian Center for Solidarity with the Peoples (Cebraspo) has a summary of what the process represents:
 </p>
<p>
  “Absurdly convicted in the first instance to penalties that reach 7 years in closed regime, by an contaminated process of illegalities and that does not have any evidence against any of the processed, this process and its sentence is not only intended to criminalize the 23 activists but the right of manifestation and free organization. The Brazilian Center for Solidarity to Peoples calls all the democrats and entities in defense of the rights of the people to position themselves in defense of 23, and against the criminalization of the popular struggle. ”
 </p>
<p>
  The hearing will take place in the e. Seventh Criminal Chamber - Music Alley 175 - Blade 4 - Room 205. It can also be accompanied through the

 </p>
<p>
  The New Democracy newspaper will continue to cover this fight against the criminalization of the popular struggle.

 As a racing move we call on Thursday 21/3/2024 at 6:30 pm In the lions all teachers and all unions in a complaint gathering
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  1) All political persecution against teachers that is ongoing.
 </p>
<p>
  2) The arrests of the 49 students of the School of Positive Sciences of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, who have been brought to the courts with heavy charges because they are fighting against the establishment of private university.
 </p>
<p>
  In detail from the press conference in Athens by: Trade Unions &amp; AMP; Movements collectives - neighborhood movements
 </p>
<p>
  Recently, a trade union and political persecution industry has been opened against teachers. All over the country are utilized all administrative and judicial mechanisms to find militant teachers to find hostages in disciplinary and courtrooms. Various reactionary provisions of the Civil Service Code are utilized as well as the anti -union legal framework passed in recent years (Chatzidakis, Georgiadis Laws, etc.)
 </p>
<p>
  Specifically there are:
 </p>
<p>
  4 persecutions (disciplinary and criminal) for participating in the mobilization of ELME Piraeus (with ADEDY workstation) against the PISA exams.
 </p>
<p>
  2 criminal and disciplinary persecution of teachers for "inappropriate out -of -service behavior", due to participation in mobilizing the anniversary of the murder of 15 -year -old Grigoropoulos, based on the (Hunting inspiration) prohibitions in the pandemic.
 </p>
<p>
  3 Criminal Persecution of Teachers for the Mobilization of ELME Piraeus against the Piraeus Government Guardian fiesta in favor of private schools and for mobilizations of the Association at the Piraeus GRN offices. In this lawsuit made by the Piraeus Piraeus, he is also the president of the Piraeus Labor Center who participated and supported the mobilization.
 </p>
<p>
  2 Disciplinary persecutions (referral from the Piraeus GGM) for "malicious criticism of the Head of Authority", on the occasion of public (!) Criticism in the policies of the Ministry.
 </p>
<p>
  1 Primary Primary Education Prosecution in Thessaloniki because it was involved in mobilizations against auctions.
 </p>
<p>
  1 disciplinary prosecution of a colleague (SAD) from the Directorate of Secondary Education of Imathia for "his behavior at the General Assembly of E' ELME-Th on 4/5/2022 at the 1st High School of Stavroupoli", of which at that time he was a member and participated in the General Assembly.
 </p>
<p>
  3 referrals to the Regional Education Disciplinary Office of colleagues in Athens for their participation in the Strike-Abstinence by Mentors-Coordinators announced by the educational unions.
 </p>
<p>
  Among all this at times colleagues are called to apology to the training departments for written explanations, are threatened with SAD, are called to police departments because they participated in a strike (Rethymnon).
 </p>
<p p="">
<p>
   It is a fact that all these persecutions are part of the overall blow to the action of unions, the right to demonstration, strike and mobilization.
  </p>
<p>
   It is not only about persecuted but all workers, youth, the people who want to resist policies that hit and dismantle rights in work, education, health.

  The CIEP of the neighborhood of Vista Alegre, in Barra Mansa, has been without light for more than four months, according to complaints from residents of the region made to the correspondent local
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  . The complaint was initially made during a brigade of the Volta Redonda Support Committee in the Barra Mansa region, and confirmed by a visit by the CIEP correspondent.
 </p>
<p>
  In an interview on March 7, students of the third year denounced the damage of lack of light to training. Added to the problems of teaching itself, caused mainly by the application of new high school (neither) at school, students suffer from the lack of perspective on the professional future. According to them, neither prevents a robust curriculum that allows students to enter the university, and the lack of light harms the rest that could be used. Some school officials, aware of student problems, did not give interviews on the grounds that they were forbidden to speak.
 </p>
<p>
  Responsible for students concerned about the formation of their children sought answers in the city, but were answered with the old justification of the “lack of funds”. According to residents, bureaucrats would also have tried to blame the maintenance for Light, the company responsible for electricity in the city. The company, in turn, puts responsibility in the City Hall, leaving the population with the impression of being tied hands and with no prospect of action to solve this problem.
 </p>
<p>
  Disregard with education does not only affect students, but also teachers. This is visible by the decision of SEPE - RJ (State Union of Education Professionals of the State of Rio de Janeiro) for the strike in 2023. During the mobilization, they reported wages far below the salary floor compared to other states of Brazil .

       The Red Socorro, founded by the Comintern in 1920, declared on March 18, the day of the foundation of the commune of Paris, as “International Day of Solidarity with political prisoners” in 1923 and dedicated it to political prisoners.

        In each period of history there has been great resistance to the exploitation and oppression systems in which we have lived for miles of years, and a high price has been paid for it.

</span>
<span style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<span style="vertical-align: inherit;">
<span style="vertical-align: inherit;">
        To each fight against the dominant exploitation and oppression systems, to each resistance, the reaction of the ruling classes has been similar: destroy any movement that is directed against its existence to ensure its existence and, above all, those to destroy those who

        The other dimension of the intolerance and aggression of the ruling classes against the popular revolutionary, communist and democratic movements is to ensure that the oppressed popular masses remain silent and do not dare to rebel.

<p>
  Today, 19/3, the scheduled discussion of the appeal of the Supreme Court's appeal against the 5 -member Court of Appeal for the 11 fighters from Turkey was held. The prosecutor of the headquarters, without further oral arguments, called for the appeal to be upheld. The two defense lawyers of the fighters, representing some of the defendants who were all absent, verbally developed their legal and real arguments to respond to the prosecutor's proposal. Related documents submitted and will be deposited on both sides.
 </p>
<p>
  The courtroom was full of solidarity - following a call from the Solidarity Committee set up for support and irrevocable acquittal of these militants - who were in support of them. It is noteworthy that for all other cases that were being tried only the lawyers involved and a few parties were attended, and the expanded presence of audience was completely felt by the court headquarters.
 </p>
<p>
  Then everyone gathered outside the Supreme Court building, opened banners and red flags and shouted slogans in Greek and Turkish. Members of the KKE (M-L), which participates in the Solidarity Committee, were attended throughout the procedure, both inside and outside the courtroom. The monthly hunger strike of the two People's Front fighters ended today, and the three prisoners in prison continue indefinitely.
 </p>
<p>
  The assessment of the outcome of the trial is directly related to the relationships between the ruling classes of the two countries and their expression in today's phase, as well as the aspirations of the US and the EU. It depends on the forthcoming visit to Mitsotakis to the neighbor but also whether the Greek government wants to make another "gift" to Turkish in view of the aforementioned summit or qualify for the issue of "crawling", keeping the fighters hostage.
 </p>
<p>
  From the beginning this prosecution was purely political, it continues to be and apparently the Supreme Court's court ruling will be exactly the same.
 </p>
<p>
  Reject the appeal! To acquit all the fighters irrevocably!
 </p>

    Europe is first and foremost a geographical concept, but

Not only geographical but economic-social concepts. As Engels said to
At the end of the nineteenth century and Lenin reaffirmed himself, after 1905, Eastern Europe is not
not a geographical concept but an economic-social one. This needs to be brought forward
because we are going to encounter this reality when dealing with the agrarian problem in Europe,
In addition, there are differences in degree between countries and also within countries.
In each country, there are regional differences in this problem, which are more marked in different countries.

 agricultural farms of the EU generalize about the disappearance process 
 of small agriculture for the benefit of the large in capitalist countries

    Problem is that, in many cases, the 
 classification or determination of the agricultural structure is done as if in the EU 
 27 There was a single economic world in agriculture, without differences from 
 development of capitalism, based on this, sometimes the 
 agrarian companies not for their investment and accumulation of capital, but for their 
 size measured in hectares. This leads to the true 
 agricultural producers, workers and small farmers, with the capitalists 
 that invest their capital in agriculture.

<strong>
   The UN Relief Organization for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) reports that more children should have been killed in Gaza over the past four months, than total in conflicts throughout the world over the last four years. They point out that more than 12,300 children have been killed in Gaza.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Philippe Lazzarini, commander of Unrwa, calls the numbers of killed children "staggering" and states that this war is a war on children, and against the children's childhood and future. He has referred to UN figures showing that 12,193 children were killed in war in the world between 2019 and 2022, while the health authorities of the Gaza Strip have reported that more than 12,300 children have been killed in the Palestinian area since October 7, 2023.
 </p>
<p>
  As of March 17, al-Jazeera reports that more than 13,000 children have now been killed, and the genocide is intensified when 1.5 million people in Gaza are now threatened by famine. Already, children of hunger die every day, while Israel blocks the importation of food and other necessities. Emergency aid is unloaded on trucks at the border of Gaza, but is denied by the Zionist State.
 </p>
<p>
  Unrwa also reports that relief workers are killed and injured in the war. They have lost more than 160 employees as a result of the war against Gaza. Israel has accused Unrwa of having Hamas members among its employees who participated in the attack on October 7, which has led to a number of countries, including the United States, withdrawn the support of UNRWA. This shows that Israel targeted not only attacks the Palestinian people with bombing homes and hospitals, and also exposes 1.5 million people to starvation, but that they also targeted all forms of emergency aid, including UN-Bistand. All the time under the protection of the Security Council member the United States, who systematically closes its veto unlike his lackeys in Israel.

   In the late evening of yesterday, various patrols of the Carabinieri Radiomobile Operational Unit carried out home searches at the home of three Si Cobas unionists, arrivals in the front row in the fight against the Maxidi of Belfiore: Asmerom ZemenFe and Abbas Mohsan of the national executive and Florina Ghiorghita of the national coordination.

   All three companions were seized by cell phones and their respective SIMs, considered "body of the crime", relating to the strikes started from June last year to claim the actual and integral application of the CCNL freight and logistics transport in the warehouse of the GDO of Belfiore, and which in recent weeks has produced 17 days of strike and garrisons outside the gates following the will of the new supplier (the Manhandwork Cooperative) not to recognize the SI Cobas, largely majority among the workers.

   The main charges, needless to say, are the usual: private violence, resistance to public officials and road blocking as well as "revised and corrected" by the new security decree of the Meloni government.

   Evidently the Prosecutor of Verona, who issued the search mandate, intends to use the seizures of the personal goods of our companions as an intimidation tool in order to stop the strikes outside the Maxidi warehouses and the protests of the workers who have developed in these weeks also on the-sales points, reaching the point of expressing assessments of merit on the rightness or not of the strikes: an all political judgment that should exhate from the role and tasks of a power of attorney ...

   As far as we are concerned, we strongly report this yet another repressive and intimidating act towards our organization, and we reiterate once again that the legitimacy of the strikes decide are not the courts nor the owners, but the workers: those workers who in the Strike put their wages and their jobs at stake in order to eliminate exploitation, hunger wages and anti -union reprisals.

 State has expanded his powers for years now. Above all, to the 
 police and other security bodies have been conferred wide 
 rights, while the fundamental rights have been more and more 
 Violato. In the current Rondenbarg case, the judiciary is 
 Avenged for losing his face at the top of the G20 and the same 
 time wants to further limit the right of meeting. Also 
 From the outside, the left events resemble more marches

 Even if the government representatives like to be photographed at

    The 
 German State is hitting the Turkish and Kurdish left structures 
 with even greater severity. Unfortunately, this is almost 
 unknown by the public. With an artificial accusation of terrorism (§ 
 129b), people are imprisoned over and over again, even if 
 They are not personally accused of a crime. The alleged 
 belonging to PKK (Kurdistan workers' party) or al 
 DHKP-C (Turkish revolutionary organization) is sufficient for 
 several years in prison, making Germany the tyrapy of 
 Erdogan.

 An entire system of discrimination is created, there are prisons of

 People are in prison for crimes against property. Among them 
 There are almost no wealthy tax switches, because they often come 
 offered them agreements while the "small fish" go to 
 prison. This is an expression of class justice. In 
 prison, detainees are exploited in miserable conditions for a few

    The

 police and other security bodies have been conferred wide 
 rights, while the fundamental rights have been more and more

 Avenged for losing his face at the top of the G20 and the same

    The 
 German State is hitting the Turkish and Kurdish left structures 
 with even greater severity. Unfortunately, this is almost 
 unknown by the public. With an artificial accusation of terrorism (§ 
 129b), people are imprisoned over and over again, even if 
 They are not personally accused of a crime. The alleged 
 belonging to PKK (Kurdistan workers' party) or al 
 DHKP-C (Turkish revolutionary organization) is sufficient for 
 several years in prison, making Germany the tyrapy of 
 Erdogan.

  The government's persecution industry is expanding against teachers and workers with dozens of lawsuits and civilizations throughout Greece and with a special way against Piraeus teachers, upgrading the settled indictment.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The dismissal of the EKPA employee, the prosecutions of the president of the Piraeus Labor Center, to the president of PENEN, and even Mitsotakis' recent statements about the deletions of the students who occupy a continuation of the political and trade union industry and is an integral part of the industry. Public and political life. It is clear that the system has one goal alone. To put the resistance, the claim, the struggle to illegally. To put in illegality the class union and political action, to crush democratic rights and political freedoms, but also any collective racing expression against the anti -populist anti -labor policy of the system.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  They want a school adapted to the labor and social medieval times that attempt to impose. They want to prepare the youth for modern slaves of capitalism. They want teachers to work without rights, with their head bent, aligned and obedient performers of their class reactive policy.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The government is stepping up persecution at a time when it is escalating the attack on training with a host of bills and cutting off private universities, facing the fair struggle of students and students with the intensity of state terrorism and repression. With prosecutors, with arrests of students, with the state mechanism of directors and rectors in the campaign of threats, strokeing demonstrations, with military -type repressive interventions at universities to evacuate the democratic determinations. Asylum.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  The government and the system are sending a message to the "enemy" people that anti -populist politics will pass with "fire and iron". How the only "regularity" is the profitability of local and foreign capital. In this regularity they want to subdue the people by unlawful student and student occupations, farmers 'blocks, workers' strikes, defense of popular housing, gatherings, demonstrations, trade unions and political action. For this reason, the system intensifies the policy of fascism, equipped the repressive mechanisms, is fortified by a number of laws that abolish democratic rights.
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
  In this context, teachers are persecuted by a system that is scared and runs to prevent the accumulated rage and indignation of the people, workers and youth not turning into a struggle, a popular uprising for the right to study, at work, in Freedoms, in life. They are afraid of the power of popular, workers and youth struggles. They know that the right of the struggle is more powerful than state violence, that the popular struggle can fear their real nightmare. They don't scare us, they don't terrorize us. We continue on the road to the relentless and incompatible fight with high fists.

<strong>
   Our comrades in Socialist Revolution write about changes in the requirements for military service in Denmark, and warn of preparations for interimperialist attack war.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  They write about the Danish Armed Forces' provision to remove the minimum requirement requirement (155cm) and requirements for BMI. The changes in the requirements were justified by the fact that up to 50 per cent of those who attend session are rejected. The changes come in addition to an initiative to double the number of conscripts by including women. Danish imperialism, through bourgeois media, will present it as a feminist initiative, and push it through as a grip on equality. Both the removal of requirements for military service and inclusion of women in the military is the attempt of Danish imperialism to prepare for new imperialist conflicts and attack wars that they will participate in as part of NATO.
 </p>
<p>
  It is also easy to see similar measures in Norway, where bourgeois media and a Breit range of bourgeois parties are trying to introduce military service for all young people who leave high school. Again, the reasons for this are that "we must increase readiness" and that we are in "demanding times". As in Denmark, many of the bourgeois parties agree with the proposal, from Red to the Progress Party. This, in addition to the military exercise "Cold Response", and new agreements on new American bases in Norway show how willing the imperialists are to recruit more people to waste in interimperialist attack wars, in service of bourgeoisie and Yankee emperialism.

  According to the testimony of Mauro Cid, the reserve general Braga Netto directed Lieutenant Colonel to seek money from the Liberal Party (PL), chaired by Valdemar Costa Neto, to pay the military of the army's “special forces” military (OS special forces ”(OS
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  black) for manifestations of green chickens in Brasilia.
 </p>
<p>
  The money was initially requested Cid by Rafael Martins de Oliveira, one of the "special forces" scammers who was responsible for organizing the participation of
  <em>
   kids
  </em>
  Black in the Bolsonarist demonstrations. According to messages collected on Cid's cell phone, Oliveira requested CID R $ 100,000 and guidelines of “places for the demonstrations”, as well as confirmations “if the armed forces would guarantee the permanence of people on site”.
 </p>
<p>
  Cid, in turn, went to Braga Netto to seek the source of money, which guided him to search the PL. Netto, at the time candidate for vice president on Bolsonaro's plate, worked exactly at the headquarters of the PL. As a logistics head of some party operations, the general had a room and a team of their own. In this position, it is likely that if Netto gave this guidance, some certainty had that the association would provide the money.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  The role of the military 'special forces'
 </h4>
<p>
  It is now known that the “special forces” of the Army played an important role in the far-right coup joint, especially in logistical and operational support to the manifestations of green chickens.
 </p>
<p>
  Force, considered as “elite” in the reactionary army, specializes in irregular operations, including sabotage and insurgency actions. There are several suspicions that point to the participation of the “Special Forces” in the second Bolsonada of 8/1, especially at critical moments such as the opening of the hatch and preparation of the material for the green chickens enter the building. Images show that, on the day, Balaclava figures (dress that is part of the “special forces” uniform), played a role on the front line and directly guided some actions.
 </p>
<p>
  Other evidence of the participation of the military of the “Special Forces” in the coup joint are Cid's own messages. In addition to the request of money by Martins, other conversations reveal that the military was used by Bolsonaro assistants in the organization of acts and the organization of the coup culmination. Message exchanges with the egress of the “Special Forces” Bernardo Romão Correia Neto also proved that Neto was responsible for articulating a meeting with several “special forces” in residential buildings in Brasilia and in the writing of the “Charter to Commander of the army of higher officers of the Brazilian Army active ”, signed by hundreds of officers and intended to press the then Commander Freire Gomes for the institutional rupture.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Who are and where are the rest?
 </h4>
<p>
  Both the letter and the “Special Forces” meeting raise important questions about the investigation. For the Federal Police, it is essential to find out who played the military's trip to Brasilia. This is important, but it may not be the most crucial.
 </p>
<p>
  Another issue of paramount importance, perhaps even greater, is the very identification of these military. Who are the special forces who attended the meeting in Brasilia with members of the coup core? Where are they today? And how many were exactly, and who they are, the
  <strong>
   Official High
  </strong>
  Who signed the letter for the institutional break in November 2022, a document that, when issued, the army sought to demoralize it by the initiative of “reserve people”? It is known that two of the writers were colonels, then active:
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/altos-oficiais-da-ativa-redigiram-carta-para-pressionar-comandante-do-exercito-a-ruptura-institucional-aberta/">
   Giovani Pasini and Alexandre Bitencourt
  </a>
  . Cid, Oliveira, Romão Correia Neto and Braga Netto may have helped, the first three of the active. Which others? What about those who signed? Freire Gomes has already stated before, without evidence, that the military has been identified and punished, but other evidence shows that this is not entirely true: General Estevam Theophilo, for example, a member of the Bolsonarist Center, said he did not punish the subordinates who They signed the letter beyond a "drawing attention for the breaking of hierarchy."
 </p>
<p>
  These are questions to take into consideration. After all, it is already known that those of the military summit that denied participating in the institutional rupture
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/luiz-inacio-deveria-se-preocupar-com-os-generais-legalistas/">
   They did not do so for an unchanging principle, but for the lack of support from the United States (USA) and the fear of a revolutionary uprising of the masses against the coup
  </a>
  . Today, they continue to intervene in national political life, as the “moderating power” who understand that they are (as Freire Gomes himself admitted, in the letter signed by the three commanders in 2022).
 </p>
<p>
  In more burning scenarios, at different variables to international levels, and under new pressures of most of those who supported the rupture and continue in the barrack, what will be the choice of the new commander?

  On March 3 there was a protest against the destruction of the natural environment committed by the organizers of the Stock Car automobile event, such as the cut of dozens of trees on the Esplanade of Mineirão Stadium near the Federal University of Minas Gerais (MG). Protesters report that R $ 20 million have already been spent by the city of Belo Horizonte to hold this sporting event that has strong commercial appeal. The local correspondent
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  He was present and collected complaints from representatives of social organizations and personalities who promoted the protest.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Cleiton Aguiar, researcher and professor at UFMG:
 </h4>
<p>
  “Stock Car around Mineirão will undermine scientific research at UFMG […] studies on sleep, rare diseases, cancer, vaccine development, other brain diseases such as Alzheimer's are widely affected with this event. There are millions of reais of public money invested in this type of research that is at stake. Most experimental research is done with rodents, rats and mice, which are night animals, sleep during the day. Most laboratory research are rats, which have high sound sensitivity. Stock car cars generate many noises. […]. The Stock Car event takes several days between training and the race itself. It will be several days of sleep deprivation of these animals. The scientific tests that are underway will be widely impaired. Will be years of research lost… ”

<p>
  “They are trying to build a temporary use race track. The Belo Horizonte Master Plan establishes that Autodrome is licensed and has a normative deliberation of the Municipal Environment Council that includes a racing activity as an activity of great environmental impact, defining that more than 10,000 square meters of useful area is an race track large.
 </p>
<p>
  Here, taking the area of Mineirão, 85 thousand square meters, that is, they want to build an race track without going through due environmental licensing process, in a size that is
  <strong>
   eight and a half times and a half
  </strong>
  The limit to consider itself large. No studies of locational alternatives. When you are going to do any environmental feasibility analysis, the first thing you do is a study of locational alternatives to see possibilities to receive that venture, with reduced environmental impacts, and we have options, having much less impact.
 </p>
<p>
  They chose to pass in front of the University Hospital, a hospital area, and placed the point of more noise of the stock car, which reaches almost 110 decibels, in front of the veterinary hospital. The contract allows the surrounding roads to be cleared for 19 days every year (5 years). Why not do at Pampulha airport? There is an opposite straight line of almost 3 kilometers that would receive the best stock car in Brazil

  “Here we have domestic animals that walk around here, birds that are already used to, 1500 birds that make this dormitory area, 138 species, and one of them is in world extinction. Why did she stop here? Because she got a safety, a comfort. […] We would like them to present a management plan with the animals. […] The counselors (Comam, Municipal Council of the Environment) did not want to make a technical visit on site. Our question is: What's the problem? What impediment would this visit bring? So we want the transparency and presentation of the documents we ask for the Coman counselors.

  “We plant fruit trees throughout the metropolitan region and we go against what the city is doing with the suppression of trees. While we have more than 5,000 trees planted, the city is destroying 73 trees that do not even plant 2,500 will have the same benefit. These trees here are over 30, 40 years old. If you cut such a tree and plant a seedling that represents a branch, the benefit will not be the same. It will take a long time for them to grow, if they survive, that the city is making planting out of the period. ”

 </h4>
<p>
  “There are studies on the technical non -viability of the construction of a car post on site precisely by the width of the track, because it does not support the public that the stock car expects to receive, by the topography itself, would not be the most appropriate place. In Belo Horizonte there are other more appropriate places that were not even considered as possibilities.

<p>
  Supported by popular movements, the residents of the Luiz Gomes occupation in Campina Grande made, on March 16, a brigade to finish the work to implant water pipes and thus enable quality access to water for all.
 </p>
<p>
  On the night of the same day there was also a victorious celebration of the International Day of Proletarian Women with Speech, Gived and a great tribute to the companion Perla Albuquerque Lima, resident of the deceased occupation just over a month ago, naming the popular school with its name.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Project
 </h4>
<p>
  Last year, residents of the Luiz Gomes occupation, with the support of CDP-CG (Campina Grande Popular Defense Comment), the Metropolis Observatory and the Green Campina Collective, were able to approve a project to implement the sewage and water through from the NGO Habitat to Humanity Brazil.
 </p>
<p>
  The NGO provided a project based on the purchase of materials and hiring some essential services for the progress of the work, but since the main direction of the money was the purchase of materials, it was necessary that the residents and supporters of Occupation unite forces, working together to improve their housing conditions. Thus, the work that began in September/2023, is expected to end the month of March/2024.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Celebrations and honors
 </h4>
<p>
  Uniting collectives, supporters and residents, the brigade was held on March 9 in order to accelerate the work in force. In addition to the work in the work itself, a collective feijoada was also prepared in the popular school kitchen, activities with children and sweepstakes for those present.
 </p>
<p>
  There was also a moment of celebration and honors to emphasize the importance of International Proletarian Women's Day, with women of the occupation present, when a pamphlet was published by the Popular Women's Movement.

<p>
  Finally, but not least, the tribute to the companion Perla. Perla was a woman in the fight, despite her serious health problems (fought lupus), was present in this fight for housing since the beginning, in 2020, when she raised her small canvas shack. Perla has always been present in the school activities, participating in training courses, ensuring the organization and preservation of the school and also showing interest in teaching reinforcement classes for children.
 </p>
<p>
  Last January, the partner Perla passed away after contracted Covid, a picture that complicated her health problem already affected by Lupus. Mother of 4 children, Perla left her small shack, who over these years, with a lot of effort, turned into a masonry house, but, more than that, left the example for so many other women who are in the fight for the fight for home. Therefore, to remember this great companion, the school was named “Popular School Perla Albuquerque Lima”.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  And the mayor?
 </h4>
<p>
  While residents build their housing infrastructure and struggle more and more for dignity, the mayor, in an election year, promised to have the electricity poles install in the occupation, which currently still has very precarious lighting. The promise was made last year, on the first day of the exhaustion works, giving it a period of 15 days, but, as expected, the people are still without the promised posts.
 </p>
<p>
  The mayor doubts the intelligence and capacity of the organized people: while promising worlds and funds in the hope of getting votes, it maintains in court a process of repossession of the land where the occupation Luiz Gomes was established.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Mexico, a wide and lively campaign is currently developing into a boycott of the upcoming presidential elections of the old Mexican state taking place on June 2nd.
  <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/13/mexico-avances-sobre-el-boicot-contra-la-farsa-electoral/">
   The comrades of the democratic and revolutionary website Mural Periodico write about the peculiarity of the Mexican election campaign in a report on the activities of the activities.
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the election campaign, the election campaign as a central venue for contradictions and power is between the various political groups of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, comprador bourgeoisie and large landowners also lead to violence between these parliamentary groups. The comrades report this since the start of the pre-campaign on November 6th last year there were a total of 23 murder of politicians from the bureaucrat capitalist-large state. Another proof that the factions of the ruling classes and their political staff are only concerned with personal power for their own interests and the elections are not held in the least in the interests of the people in order to advance the country.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Meanwhile, some powerful and combative actions against the election propaganda of the old Mexican state and the parties of the large bourgeoisie and large landowners took place as part of the election boycamping.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Chiapas in the south of Mexico, an attack on a building of the electoral authority occurred on February 21. In the attack, the building was thrown at stones and Molotov cocktails, which led to a fire inside the building which partially burned and set furniture on fire. This led to a large -scale deployment of the state police and the national guard as well as the fire brigade.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img alt="wahlboykottmexiko2" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko2.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko2.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Mexican state of Oaxaca, various propaganda actions against the elections took place on March 4 during a major mobilization with over a thousand participants. In this way, participants of the demonstration of the various parties remove and brought the walls to the boycott of the elections. The distant voting propaganda was then under the slogans "Elections are not the solution, the solution is the revolution!" And "does not vote, prepare for the fight".
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img alt="wahlboykottmexiko3" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko3.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko3.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the capital of the country, Mexico City, as part of the struggle for the tenth anniversary of 43 students, actions were carried out by police officers, in which the association of rural teachers and teaching students only expropriated a pick-up of the state electricity concentrate CFE And then with this pick-up, while severe fighting with the military and city police, broke a goal from the presidential palace.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<img alt="wahlboykottmexiko1" src="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko1.png" srcset="https://demvolkedienen.org/images/Mexiko/2024/wahlboykottmexiko1.png"/>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  These powerful and brutal actions are not only an expression of the deep crisis in which bureaucratic capitalism and the old Mexican state are located, but also reflects the soul of the election boycott. The boycott of the elections refuses to legitimation to the old system and answers the question of how change can instead go to the fact that the popular masses, led by the revolutionaries, have to fight against the old system with revolutionary violence. This applies not only to the conditions in Mexico, but is a strategic question which applies to every country in the world, regardless of whether it is an oppressed nation or an imperialist nation.

  At the beginning of March, the UFPE Rectory, represented by Rector Alfredo Gomes, signed an agreement with the Military Institute of Engineering (IME), which aims at the advancement of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security. The project also founded a course for this objective, which will begin in early 2025. Although promoted with the “development” discourse of IME and the university, the project serves to deepen the performance of the reactionary army at the university.
 </p>
<p>
  Rector Alfredo Gomes emphasizes the “importance of jointly building partnerships to strengthen such strategic and important areas for Brazil”, while the dean of the Military Institute of Engineering emphasizes the character of this partnership: “It is part of a strategic action of DCT (Department of Army science and technology), aiming at the most effective participation of the
  <em>
   in various regions of the country
  </em>
  ”.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Specific moment
 </h4>
<p>
  The new step for the greatest military presence at the university does not occur in isolation. The reactionary armed force received other recent incentives in the state, such as the construction of the Pernambuco Sergeant School, supported by the federal government.
 </p>
<p>
  The greatest militarization occurs concomitantly to the advancement of the peasant struggle in the state. In the municipality of
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/posseiros-da-mata-sul-pernambucana-defendem-suas-terras-e-rejeitam-acordos-com-latifundio/">
   Jaqueira, for example, squatters has resisted bluntly to the offensive of the landlord
  </a>
  . On the stairs, important peasant protests
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/pe-moradores-de-escada-fecham-br-101-no-terceiro-dia-seguido-apos-pm-executar-campones/">
   blocked roads after the execution of a peasant by a PM
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  In universities, the military presence can be seen as a threat to the development of the student struggle, especially if taken into account the constant demonstrations of support of the combative student movement to the fields in the field, from peasants, to indigenous and quilombolas.

</strong>
<strong>
<sup>

</strong>
<strong>
<em>
    , at 2 p.m., at Place du Peuple in Saint-Etienne (42) for an event to commemorate the Paris Commune!
   </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The reactionary wave that has engulfed the country since the 1990s continues to grow, leaving the “people of the left” speechless. The absolute domination of a clique of lobbyists over the media leads us to believe that the entire country has sunk into reactionary, anti-Enlightenment and anti-emancipation ideas. The manipulation of History is an old technique of the ruling to try to transform the present in their image.
  <strong>
   Current and past policies inevitably pave the way for fascism and war. We can only be worried about the warlike
  </strong>
<strong>
   tone
  </strong>
<strong>
   s of the “
  </strong>
<strong>
   first of the
  </strong>
<strong>
   citizens” and his henchmen, while tensions between nuclear powers are growing.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The economic crisis, impoverishment, the march towards war, reactionary and racist policies deserve a clear response from all that this country has of democrats, progressives, humanists, trade unionists, associations, activists,
  <strong>
   all those who think that the emancipation of the human race is not an old thing of the 20th century, but the future of the 21st.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The history of the workers’ and people’s movement is strewn with armed feats. Our entire social system, our democratic freedoms, are the result of the struggles of the past. The future of the country is only the fruit of today’s struggles and tomorrow. The only guarantor of political and social rights is the people.
 </p>
<p>
  We, citizens, left-wing activists, trade unionists, progressives, humanists, believe that we need historical benchmarks, milestones to be part of a much longer process than the ephemeral tweets of current politicians. We could cite the Great French Revolution, the struggles for the Republic and June 1848, the People’s Front and the Resistance, but of all these dates one particularly serves as an inerasable, temporal mark, because its heart is marked with that of the eternity,
  <strong>
   we want to talk about the Epic of the Commune!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  It was the first republic of workers in the country and in the world, it abolished the army, separated the State and the Church, gave education for all, new rights to the working class, and it saved the honor of the country sold to the Prussians by the Versailles. The political emancipation of women was the work of the Commune. Real democracy was put in place, with revocability of elected officials at all levels and direct consultation of the people. The Commune was profoundly internationalist, the French citizen was the one who found himself in the universal ideals carried by the Commune.
 </p>
<p>
  The current government is of the same caliber as those from Versailles: republican and democratic in form, ultra-reactionary in substance. Continuing the long work of destroying the public good (public enterprises, social system, education, pensions, health, etc.), he wants to call into question the achievements of the Resistance more than ever.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   To commemorate the Commune is to commemorate the
  </strong>
<strong>
   unreclaimable
  </strong>
<strong>
   , the event which made all the
  </strong>
<strong>
   powerful
  </strong>
<strong>
   of Europe tremble, which resonated throughout the world as a new era, that of the Universal Republic of Workers, that of the emancipation of human
  </strong>
<strong>
   kind
  </strong>
<strong>
   , that of bread and peace.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   The Commune is not a dead idea, it is a future to be reconquered, an expanding ideal which we must all seize, today, as the antithesis of this Republic which defiles its fundamental principles.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Long live the Commune !
  </strong>

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024. CURRENT:  15 FEBRUARY - 15 MARCH 2024             2.13M 95% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 677,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 876,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 578,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 96,000 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security PROJECTED:  16 MARCH - 15 JULY 2024             2.23M 100% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 1,107,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 854,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 265,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 0 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security    IPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY ANALYSIS   15 FEBRUARY - 15 JULY 2024   Published on 18 March 2024IPC Global Initiative - Special Brief IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC global initiative and do not necessarily reflect the views of stakeholders in Palestine. This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1. Missions planned, facilitated and denied, October 2023 to Mid-February 2024. Source: OCHA Map 2. Distribution of IDPs staying in Collective  Centres. Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Challenges in use of cash, since 7 October 2023 and January 2024. Source: Cash Working Group Figure 10. Quantity of Diesel and Domestic Gas imported per day. Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men. Some women are now resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, such as scavenging for food under rubble  or in dumpsters.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF16Area Governorate % of total Gaza populationURB LZ SAG LZ % of governorate HHs with kcal gaps indicative  of IPC 5 % of area (northern/southern) with kcal gaps  indicative of IPC 5Estimated % of population in the LZ  (URB) Very Poor (24% of the LZ population)  Survival Deficit (SD), Indicative IPC Phase Poor (33%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (41%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (4%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Estimated % of population in the LZ  (SAG) Very Poor (32%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Poor (37%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (25%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (7%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024)Northern Gaza North Gaza5% 100%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 50% N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 100,0%Gaza5% 94%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 56%86%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 584%,  Phase 549%,  Phase 4100%Southern Gaza Deir al Balah (or  middle Gaza)10% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferred To be inferred based on Khan Younis and Deir al Balah assumptions  and convergence of other data higlighting where and to what  extent conditions resemble Rafah vs. Northern GazaKhan  Younis21% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferredRafah59% 97%33%  survival  deficit,  Phase 432%  survival  deficit,  Phase 445%  survival  deficit,  Phase 427%  survival  deficit,  Phase 43%13%  survival  deficit,  100%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival  deficit,  89%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10% survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10,0% SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024)simulation -  Rafah invasion 59% 97%67% 64% 63% 54% 3%42% 31% 0% 0%  Phase 5 Phase  5 Phase 5 Phase  5Phase 4 Phase 4 Phase 1 Phase 1<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF17 NUTRITION SITUATION Inadequate dietary intake According to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster in December  2023-January 2024,61 in North Gaza, 98 percent of the children (47 observations) included in the analysis had consumed  two or fewer food groups in the 24 hours preceding the survey. Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF20 Nitrate levels already exceeded 150 mg/litre  in most areas of the Gaza Strip, which made  the water undrinkable, given the World Health  Organization (WHO) acceptable limit of 50  mg/litre.  In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

Source: Various - reanalysis  conducted by the Global Smart Team<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF27 Mortality The analysis could not benefit from representative evidence of non-trauma mortality as intended by IPC Protocols (Crude  Death Rate and Under Five Death Rate). The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah. The wider  besiegement of the Gaza Strip would intensify.Conflict would rapidly escalate, including  the onset of a new, wide-ranging, and large- scale ground operation throughout Rafah  Governorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  intense and frequent armed actor clashes, and  a large increase in bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip would  intensify. Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion. This collapse  would heavily constrain humanitarian operations  through reducing access and inhibiting the ability  to conduct critical activities like distributions,  especially to the most vulnerable population  groups. The United Nations presence within the  Gaza Strip, including offices and storage facilities,  would be particularly impacted, including by  violence and looting. The loss of social cohesion  would involve the loss of most remaining socially- based coping, such as receiving food or cash  through social networks outside of immediate  family.Already strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and  a wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

  Partizan.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Our people,
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  As a result of our general policy regarding the electoral process, our evaluations of the developments and the negotiations, we have concluded: we declare to our people that we will protest the election on the grounds that sufficient conditions are not met in Dersim, where we have the condition to participate in the election in favor of the DEM Party [The Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party], and that approaches that are incompatible with the interests and expectations of the people are dominant here. We do not support any candidate. We see that the reaction that our people have been showing openly for a while, sometimes expressed through action, is appropriate, and that an organization based on this reaction is a basic necessity. We consider it our duty to do justice to this reaction in our work.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   THERE IS NO GROUND FOR COMMON AGREEMENT!
  </strong>
</p>
<p p="">
<p>
   We acted with this understanding during the election process in Dersim. First of all, we want this to be known. We were open to negotiations until the last moment, expecting joint work, and we even had to make a request in this direction. The findings and opinions we will present here are shared as a result of the somehow forced meetings we had with our friends.
  </p>
<p p="">
<p>
    Our evaluation of the developments and discussions in this process will explain the reason for the stance we have taken.
   </p>
<p>
<strong>
     LET FRIENDS SEE IN ALLIANCE
    </strong>
</p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
      This issue is important because it shows that the basis of the alliances in question is far from revolutionary, democratic principles and understanding, and these alliances are insincere. The coming together of these understandings does not concern the development of the struggle and obtaining permanent results. It is disconnected from the real agenda and problems of the people. Therefore, it is far from developing a solution. It searches for solutions to problems within the system without touching the system. It should be known that the source of the problem is the system itself. A radical solution to the problems is impossible without drying up this resource. That is why, to date, these institutions have not been able to develop a consistent democratic policy in municipal elections and even in “municipalism”.
     </p>
<p>
      The same result exists today. These understandings, which generally hold the people responsible for every failed practice, have always lagged behind the people, and of course still do today. Our people analyze events and facts more clearly and draw conclusions. The alliance components are tied to each other with a thread. There is an alliance shaped by coercion and “necessity to win”. “Friends should see it while shopping”, our people see the content of this alliance and clearly show their reaction. Of course, it is debatable to what extent it will affect the election results. In conclusion, this reaction is appropriate and justified.
     </p>
<p>
      Alliance talks are always drowning in candidacy debates and turning into a fight over just this issue. Of course, every political movement can nominate candidates and present them to the alliance. If they are going to enter the elections with an alliance, this issue, namely the candidate issue, cannot be left out of discussion. However, candidates should be the last topic to be discussed in discussions; firstly, it should be understood about the reasons for coming together and what will be done for what purpose. However, this is not what we see in the alliance established in Dersim, it was acted through a bargaining method in which narrow group interests were decisive. It is clear that the revolutionary struggle will not develop and the masses will not be able to organize with these understandings. On the contrary, this situation leads to degeneration in ideology. It deepens the separation from the public.
     </p>
<p>
      In order to understand what we have stated above, let’s take a look at the events that took place between the institutions as far as we know about the situation that has developed so far during the local elections process.
     </p>
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p p="">
<p>
         The name “Partizan” represents a certain line and historical accumulation. The group included in the alliance has broken away from it. We reiterate that addressing this group under the name “Partizan” is unprincipled and incompatible with friendship. We will continue to criticize and reject this wrong attitude in every environment and platform we are in.
        </p>
<p>
<strong>
          We
         </strong>
<strong>
          call,
         </strong>
</p>
<p>
         It is clear that this alliance of forces that have lost the trust of the people, formed without self-criticism to the people of Dersim and without being held accountable for these negativities, has no future. We did not have an understanding of being a part of alliances based solely on the possibility of winning elections. We share with the public that we have drawn a clear line between ourselves and this alliance, which neglects to take a sincere and honest stance even though a strong and necessary self-criticism is required and it is faced with an intense reaction from the people of Dersim in particular. We call on all our people to take a stand against these wrongs, apart from their election choices, and to be a part of our insistence on a revolutionary attitude and line.

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024.

This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1.

Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men.

Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF20 Nitrate levels already exceeded 150 mg/litre  in most areas of the Gaza Strip, which made  the water undrinkable, given the World Health  Organization (WHO) acceptable limit of 50  mg/litre.  In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

Source: Various - reanalysis  conducted by the Global Smart Team<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF27 Mortality The analysis could not benefit from representative evidence of non-trauma mortality as intended by IPC Protocols (Crude  Death Rate and Under Five Death Rate). The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah.

Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

  As part of the genocide being developed in Gaza by the State of Israel the people are suffering from rapidly increasing starvation. According to a recent
  <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_Gaza_Strip_Acute_Food_Insecurity_Feb_July2024_Special_Brief.pdf">
   report
  </a>
  1.1 million people, half of the population of Gaza, are experiencing “catastrophic food insecurity”, the 5th and last phase of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). The whole population in Gaza, 2.23 million people are facing high acute food insecurity. The rest of the population is mostly in phase 4 “emergency” while some are in phase 3 “crisis”.

  In northern Gaza, the acute lack of food is far exceeding the threshold of famine, acute malnutrition has likely exceeded the threshold, and deaths from starvation are likely soon reaching the threshold of famine. According to a UN official the situation is headed toward more than

  Since the 7
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of October 2023,
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">
   every hour
  </a>
  in Gaza 15 people are killed, six of them children, 35 people are injured and 12 buildings are destroyed. In total at least 31,726 people have been killed by the State of Israel since the beginning of the current genocidal campaign. More than 73,792 people have been injured, more than 8,000 are missing, and half of Gaza’s homes have been destroyed or damaged.
 </p>
<p>
  While the imperialists are acting as if what is going on in Gaza is some kind of natural disaster, where the only thing they can do is try to give a little aid, what is happening is no mystery. Even officials of the Yankee-dominated UN
  <a href="https://twitter.com/UNHumanRights/status/1770068341551452168">
   imply
  </a>
  that the State of Israel is using starvation as a weapon of war.
 </p>
<p>
  The laws of war, which the imperialist regularly negate it unless it fits their interests, are clearly defined and well known to any soldier in any army. Grave breaches of these laws are considered war crimes.
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciv-1949/article-55">
   Article 55
  </a>
  of the Fourth Geneva Convention states clearly that the State of Israel is responsible for the needs of the people under its occupation:
 </p>
<p>
  “
  <em>
   To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population; it should, in particular, bring in the necessary foodstuffs, medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  The facts about the situation in Gaza stated above shows clearly that the State of Israel is committing a war crime by breaking this law.
 </p>
<p>
  On the 26
  <sup>
   th
  </sup>
  of January the International Court of Justice (ICJ) made a
  <a href="https://icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20240126-ord-01-00-en.pdf">
   preliminary ruling
  </a>
  , which stated the following:
  <em>
   “The State of Israel shall, in accordance with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II of this Convention.”
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The British NGO Oxfam has
  <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/israel-government-continues-block-aid-response-despite-icj-genocide-court-ruling">
   denounced
  </a>
  that despite the ICJ ruling the State of Israel is still deliberately blocking aid to Gaza. Among the ways the State of Israel is: blocking aid is creating choke points by only allowing aid via two crossings; imposing a bureaucratic inspection system which delays trucks for 20 days on average; and rejecting necessary supplies such as fuel, generators, protective gear and communication equipment, claiming that they can be used for military purposes.
 </p>
<p>
  By not only neglecting to provide the occupied population with nessesary supplies, but also blocking other parties from doing so, the State of Israel is also committing a war crime by breaking Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. This article requires States to “
  <em>
   allow the free passage of all consignments of medical and hospital stores
  </em>
  ” intended only for civilians and “
  <em>
   the free passage of all consignments of essential foodstuffs, clothing and tonics intended for children under fifteen, expectant mothers and maternity cases
  </em>
  ”. Paragraph 2 of
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-70">
   Article 70
  </a>
  of the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions broadens this obligation: “
  <em>
   The Parties to the conflict and each High Contracting Party shall allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of all relief consignments, equipment and personnel provided in accordance with this Section, even if such assistance is destined for the civilian population of the adverse Party.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  Paragraph 1 of
  <a href="https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/api-1977/article-54">
   Article 54
  </a>
  the Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions defines using starvation as a weapon of war as a war crime: “
  <em>
   Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited.
  </em>
  ”
 </p>
<p>
  Furthermore Paragraph 2 of the Article states that: “
  <em>
   It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party,  whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.
  </em>
  ” In Gaza 83% of groundwater wells are
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">
   reported
  </a>
  to not be operational.
 </p>
<p>
  While ignoring the obvious war crimes committed by the State of Israel, the imperialists, acting like this is a natural disaster, tries to give the impression that they want to help the people of Gaza with insufficient measures such as their air drops. When these do not
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2024/2/28/palestinians-rush-into-the-sea-as-aircraft-drop-aid-into-gaza">
   fall in the sea

  </a>
  after failing to deploy parachutes, they are still a drop in the ocean for the starving Palestinians. German imperialism has
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/german-air-force-makes-first-aid-drops-over-gaza/ar-BB1k06rq">
   deployed two transport aircraft
  </a>
  for dropping aid in Gaza, however the aircraft can only carry 18 tons each. This is less than the capacity of a truck which carries around 20 tons. While the population of Gaza needs around
  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/21/1232605200/humanitarian-aid-gaza-israel">
   500 trucks
  </a>
  of aid each day, only 2,874 trucks entered Gaza in February, less than 100 per day. The current trend is that the amount of aid is decreasing.

Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and  the latest evidence confirms that Famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime  between mid-March and May 2024. CURRENT:  15 FEBRUARY - 15 MARCH 2024             2.13M 95% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 677,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 876,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 578,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 96,000 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security PROJECTED:  16 MARCH - 15 JULY 2024             2.23M 100% of the population   analysed People facing high   acute food insecurity   (IPC Phase 3 or above) IN NEED OF URGENT  ACTIONPhase 5 1,107,000 People in Catastrophe Phase 4 854,000 People in Emergency Phase 3 265,000 People in Crisis Phase 2 0 People Stressed Phase 1 0 People in food  security    IPC ACUTE FOOD INSECURITY ANALYSIS   15 FEBRUARY - 15 JULY 2024   Published on 18 March 2024IPC Global Initiative - Special Brief IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC global initiative and do not necessarily reflect the views of stakeholders in Palestine. This analysis  factors in all data and information available up to 10 March 2024 and does not take into account the latest developments on the ground. Key Drivers Restricted humanitarian access Extremely limited humanitarian access to and within the  Gaza Strip continues to impede the safe and equitable  delivery of life-saving multi-sector humanitarian assistance  critical for Famine prevention and response. This includes  severe limitations to the supply of goods as well as basic  services.Hostilities Hostilities continue to involve the besiegement of the  entire population and widespread, intense and sustained  ground and air operations and clashes. This has caused  over 31,000 deaths and injured 73,000 people, displaced  about 1.9 million people, damaged or destroyed over half  of the buildings, and devastated assets and infrastructure  indispensable to survival, including across the food, health  and water systems.Current Acute Food Insecurity | 15 February - 15 March  Projected Acute Food Insecurity | 16 March - 15 July<br/><br/> According to the most likely scenario, both North Gaza and Gaza Governorates are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine)  with reasonable evidence, with 70% (around 210,000 people) of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe).   Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the northern governorates for humanitarian organizations  and commercial trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely limited food availability, access,  and utilization, as well as access to healthcare, water, and sanitation. The famine threshold for household acute food  insecurity has already been far exceeded and, given the latest data showing a steeply increasing trend in cases of acute  malnutrition, it is highly likely that the famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded.   In North Gaza,  acute malnutrition (by Mid-Upper Arm Circumference - MUAC) moved from a pre-escalation estimated of 1 percent to 6.8  – 9.1 percent in January and 12.4 to 16.5 percent in February (weighted for children 6-59). Acute malnutrition (by MUAC)  among children 6-23 months old increased in the same period from 16.2 percent to 29.2 percent. The upward trend in  non-trauma mortality is also expected to accelerate, resulting in all famine thresholds likely to be passed imminently.   The southern governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC  Phase 4 (Emergency). However, in a worst-case scenario, these governorates face a risk of Famine through July 2024.  The entire population in the Gaza Strip (2.23 million) is facing high levels of acute food insecurity. From mid-March to  mid-July, in the most likely scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict including a ground offensive  in Rafah, half of the population of the Gaza Strip (1.11 million people) is expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC  Phase 5), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale. This represents an increase of 530,000 people (92  percent) compared to the previous analysis. Between the current and the projection period, around 400,000 more people  are expected to slide into IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The rest of the population faces Emergency (IPC Phase 4) (854,000  people, 38 percent of the population) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population).  The escalation of the hostilities has caused widespread damage to assets and infrastructure indispensable to survival.  About 50 percent of buildings - and more than 70 percent in the northern governorates - have been damaged or  destroyed. This has included dwellings, shops and infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, as well as water, sanitation  and other facilities. Assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or  severely damaged, extremely limiting the functionality of the food system.  From a pre-escalation average of 500 trucks a day of which 150 carrying food, in the period between 7 October 2023 to  24 February 2024, only 90 trucks per day, of which only 60 carrying food, entered the Gaza Strip. Consequently, virtually  all households are skipping meals every day and adults are reducing their meals so that children can eat. In the northern  governorates, in nearly two thirds of the households, people went entire days and nights without eating at least 10 times  in the last 30 days. In the southern governorates, this applies to one third of the households. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF3 CURRENT SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (15 February - 15 March 2024 ) Population table for the current situation: 15 February - 15 March 2024 Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

At 5,900 residents per square kilometre, one of the  most densely populated areas in the world even before the concentration of most of the population in only one of five  governorates, the Gaza Strip population is extremely reliant on the cross-border movement of goods and utilities like  electricity and water.  In 2022, the Gaza Strip faced an unemployment rate of nearly  45 percent 1 and, by September 2023, the poverty rate was at 60  percent 2, among a population that included nearly 70 percent of  refugees. 3 Due to severely constrained livelihood opportunities,  in 2022, over half of the population was relying on humanitarian  assistance as their main income source and about one-third on  casual labour, 4 with 70 percent of the population food insecure. 5  Conflict . As of 14 March 2024, the ongoing hostilities have  reportedly caused nearly 105,000 casualties within the Gaza Strip  – nearly 5% of the total population. 6 This includes over 73,000  people injured, about half of them women and children, and  over 31,000 deaths. The escalation of hostilities within the Gaza Strip began with  heavy bombardment on 7 October 2023. 7 On 27 October, major  ground operations and clashes reportedly began within the Gaza  Strip. 8 These started in the northern governorates and continued  through 23 November, with a humanitarian pause from 24  November through 30 November. 9 Hostilities subsequently  resumed at high intensity, with major ground operations and  bombardment by air, land, and sea. This included the continued  expansion of a ground operation in Khan Younis Governorate,  centred on Khan Younis city. 10 Another large ground operation began in Deir al-Balah  Governorate on 24 December 2023, 11 expanding across multiple  though not all refugee camps and urban areas in the governorate.  These operations were accompanied by continued clashes  among armed actors. Clashes in the northern governorates, especially some neighbourhoods of Gaza city like Zeitoun,  re-escalated in late February 2024. 12 Bombardment by air, land, and sea of all areas of the Gaza Strip has continued  throughout this period, intensifying particularly before and during major ground operations. Humanitarian access.  Conflict continues to place severe limitations on the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver  life-saving food, nutrition, health, water, hygiene, sanitation and other life-saving assistance to the besieged population.  Commercial traffic is similarly impeded. Humanitarian access, and the ability of the most vulnerable populations to access  and participate in humanitarian activities safely is highly limited and uneven across the Gaza Strip. Once humanitarian  assistance and commercial goods enter the Gaza Strip, onward access to the northern governorates is extremely limited  and unavailable for extended periods, while access is relatively higher for the southern governorates, particularly Rafah  Governorate. While there has been improvement in access to the Gaza Strip relative to early October 2023, including  the opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing in Mid-December 2023, access to the Gaza Strip continues to fluctuate and  remains insufficient for meeting the basic needs of the overall population.  Severe limitations and attacks on humanitarian staff and assets forced major providers of humanitarian food and other  assistance to the northern governorates to suspend convoys to these areas, including the World Food Programme, on  20 February. 13 Since the previous IPC analysis on the Gaza Strip in December 2023, access denial increased significantly,  especially in the northern governorates. In January 2024, only nine humanitarian missions to the northern governorates  were facilitated, dropping to six missions in February. 14 Figure 1. Casualties in the Gaza Strip reported by the  Palestinian Ministry of Health as of 14 March 2024.  Source: Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF5 According to OCHA, constraints on humanitarian action throughout the Gaza Strip include direct strikes with explosive  weapons on humanitarian convoys, detention of humanitarian staff, road closures, checkpoints, and related blockages  or delays on main transportation corridors. Swarming of humanitarian convoys subsequently increased, including at  several hotspots throughout the Gaza Strip, such as immediately  after crossing Wadi Gaza into the northern governorates.  Physical access constraints further limit the movement of  humanitarian and commercial traffic, including road damage  from bombardment and traffic of heavy military vehicles as well  as the accumulation of an estimated 12,000 metric tons of debris  that may take up to four years to fully clear. 15  Displacement and Movement Restrictions. Displacement  continues to be driven by conflict. An evacuation order was  issued to the entire population residing north of Wadi Gaza  (1.1 million people) on 13 October, 16 followed by orders and  accompanying maps indicating to move as far south as Khan  Younis Governorate. 17 After the humanitarian pause on 24- 30 November 2023, new evacuation orders covering at least   30 percent of the entire Gaza Strip were issued. 18 The unilaterally  declared Al-Mawasi “Humanitarian Zone” was first announced  on 18 October 2023, however, humanitarian agencies did not  agree to the establishment of such zones. 19 The proposed area  has limited pre-existing services, with OCHA reporting there is  “almost no sheltering capacity” . 20  In addition to the closure of some of the main transportation corridors within the Gaza Strip, other movement restrictions  have also been announced, including a ban on movement from southern to northern governorates. 21 Additional  restrictions imposed on populations affect livelihoods and food access, such as a de facto prohibition on fishing and  movement within one kilometre of the border fence, which covers a significant proportion of farmland. 22 The movement  of livestock together with displaced populations has not generally been reported and livestock abandonment is likely  high.Map 1. Missions planned, facilitated and denied, October 2023 to Mid-February 2024. Source: OCHA Map 2. Distribution of IDPs staying in Collective  Centres. Source: Shelter Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF6 As new evacuation orders are issued alongside with continuation of bombardments  and ground operations, Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are constantly moving  in search of safety. Most of them have moved south, largely to Rafah Governorate. 23  The population in Rafah has increased about five-fold as a result, rapidly rising from  276,000 pre-escalation to over 1.3 million as of February 2024. A large proportion of  the displaced population is from Gaza and North Gaza Governorates, which have  seen their population decrease by 84 percent and 75 percent respectively. 24 Rafah Governorate, which spans over 65 km 2, now hosts around 1.3 million people. 25  In Rafah, there are 35 UNRWA shelters hosting 882,800 people and another 30  informal shelters hosting 506,300 people, 26 corresponding to over 30 percent of  the population staying in shelters. The formal shelters managed by UNRWA are  overcrowded with severely limited access to safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene  (WASH) and other services. People in informal shelters face even more difficulties  accessing health, food and non-food services. The lack of Non-food Items (NFIs)  provision in informal settlements has led people to set up makeshift shelters and  tents, which are subject to flooding on rainy days, further exacerbating the suffering  of displaced people. 27  Damages . Destruction and damage of buildings, particularly from bombardment  by air, land, and sea, is evident in all governorates of the Gaza Strip. According to  the recent satellite assessments, by late February 2024, at least 54 percent of all  buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely damaged or destroyed. The largest scale  destruction is in Gaza Governorate where more than 73 percent of buildings are  estimated to be destroyed, followed by North Gaza (70 percent), Deir al-Balah (44  percent), Khan Younis (52 percent) and Rafah (28 percent). 28 This has included  dwellings, shops and various types of infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, and  other public buildings, as well as WASH infrastructure and storage facilities, among  others.  Food Availability Production . The escalation of hostilities and mass  displacements have caused food shortages and  unavailability throughout the Gaza Strip as the food system  and agriculture value chains have collapsed or are marginally  surviving through the informal market. A significant portion  of agriculture land, encompassing orchards, greenhouses,  and farmlands has suffered extensive destruction. According  to the UNOSAT, the percent of damaged agriculture land  has increased from 25 percent to 60 percent, between  November 2023 and January 2024.29  Extensive damage has been inflicted on the local food  system, including agricultural infrastructure. More than 300  home barns, 100 agricultural warehouses, 46 farm storages,  119 animal shelters, 200 farms, as well over 600 wells used for  irrigation have been destroyed, amongst other agriculture  facilities.30 According to the FAO damage assessment of  February 2024, damage to wells was found to be most  concentrated in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates; and  in some areas, all the wells were damaged. Additionally, over  26 percent (336) of all greenhouses have been damaged  across all governorates. The governorates with the highest Map 3. Gaza Damage Mapping  26.02.2024.

Source: UNOSAT, 2023-2024<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF7 damage are Gaza (55 percent), North Gaza (48 percent), Khan Younis (35 percent), Deir al-Balah (20 percent) and Rafah  (16 percent). The Governorate of Khan Younis had the largest area of damaged greenhouses (149 hectares), followed by  Rafah (89 hectares). More than 40 percent (6,694 ha) of all croplands has been damaged since 7 October, with the highest reported damages  in Gaza (55 percent, 1,941 ha), Deir al-Balah (51 percent, 1,408 ha), North Gaza (45 percent, 1,402 ha), Khan Younis (33  percent, 1,492 ha) and Rafah (25 percent, 451 ha) Governorates. In terms of cropland type, 41 percent of irrigated land, 43 percent of orchards and 42 percent of rainfed land have been  damaged.31 The hostilities have not only led to the destruction of agricultural assets and infrastructure, they also resulted  in the displacement of populations away from agricultural land and constrained access for agricultural activities. Other assets and infrastructure necessary for food production and distribution have also been destroyed or severely  damaged, extremely limited the functionality of the food system. Although some local production, primarily of vegetables, is still ongoing, it is very  limited. Lack of access to land and destruction of crops are compounded by a lack of  access to essential agriculture inputs (fuel, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides).  Most livestock were abandoned during the large-scale displacement in October 2023.  Remaining livestock are being slaughtered or sold due to the lack of fodder and water  or due to the need for cash or other resources. Similarly, poultry lack animal feed, and  the availability of poultry meat and eggs is reduced throughout the Gaza Strip.  The comparison among the preliminary reports from the FAO Loss and Damage  assessment and the baseline figure from the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics  (PCBS), shows about 70 percent of livestock and other animals have been lost since 7  October 2024. Fishing production is largely halted due to the damage of boats, lack  of fuel and security/safe access. Some fishing is still happening, but it is only available  to those who still possess equipment and have access to fuel.  Food security assessments indicate32 that, due to the lack of food availability, some  households are resorting to eating wild foods. These range from mallow ( khebbayze  in Arabic) to unconventional food sources such as animal fodder and other unsafe  foods. Figure 2. Overview of the damage to agricultural land and infrastructure due to the conflict in the Gaza Strip as of 15 February  2024. Source: FAO<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF8 Imports . Between January and September 2023, a daily average of 150 food trucks entered the Gaza Strip. Between  8 October 2023 and 9 March 2024, this number decreased to an average of 65 trucks per day33 and the availability of  food commodities has dramatically declined. Since the escalation of the hostilities, the number of trucks allowed into  the Gaza Strip has been severely restricted, reducing the inflow of humanitarian assistance and preventing the entry of  commercial goods completely until 8 December 2023. Since then, there was an initial increase in the flow of food and  non-food commodities, facilitated through the opening of a second border crossing (Kerem Shalom).  However, in February, the flow of commodities decreased again and has been intermittent from late January through  February. The month of February in particular saw major variations highlighted in figure 3. The entry of humanitarian and commercial trucks into Gaza is significantly limited to the southern governorates, mainly  Rafah. Conversely, there are very few items reaching the northern governorates and other areas in the rest of the south of  Gaza Strip.34 OCHA estimates that less than 5 percent  of all the food trucks have reached North Gaza and  Gaza Governorates in the past four weeks, while 45  percent remained in Rafah and about 50 percent  reached Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. An in-depth  analysis of the border crossing manifest allowed to  generate approximate kilocalories values per truck  and per unit of analysis then distributed per area,  using information provided by OCHA and the Food  Security Sector. This reveals that in most days, the  quantity of food translated in kilocalories entering  in Gaza has been extremely below the requirements  in North Gaza Governorates, and mostly half the  requirements in Rafah. The only areas appearing to  have benefited from an almost sufficient amount  of kilocalories (although irregular) are in Khan  Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates (with higher  quantities in the later). This may suggest that most Figure 3. Reanalysis of food-only trucks entering Gaza through Kerem Shalom and Rafah border crossing. Source: UNRWA Figure 4. Reanalysis of the Kcal availability per unit of analysis.  Source: UNRWA, Gaza Supply and Dispatch  <br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF9 requirements in Rafah. Based on truck entries into the Gaza Strip from 21 October 2023 to 3 March 2024, the proportion of  average kilocalories per day (using a 7-day rolling average) has been consistently below the daily kilocalorie requirements  (calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender), with the exception of a short period of  time around mid-January.  A survey conducted by the World Food Programme (WFP)35 highlights that interviewed shop owners are faced with a  significant shortage of basic food items, with 81 percent indicating depletion. Furthermore, 19 percent highlighted that  the available food items are in short supply, and not expected to last more than a week. The formal market has been  heavily impacted with a non-functioning supply chain, and severely damaged shops. Consequently, the informal market  has surged. Informal markets, provide 1 or 2 types of foods (canned foods mainly), and are supplied by the beneficiaries  of assistance (selling or bartering). The WFP market monitoring indicates that most respondents have stocks inferior to 1  week or inexistent for the vast majority of the food commodities, with the exception of vegetables. All respondents have  exhausted dairy products.36 Despite the presence of at least a hundred bakeries in northern Gaza, few are able to operate due to significant challenges.  The main obstacle is the persistent shortage of flour, other bakery inputs, and fuel. In early January, WFP began supporting  12 bakeries in Rafah and Deir al-Balah.37 Access Market functionality. Informal markets now dominate both food and non-food item transactions across the Gaza Strip as  formal markets have collapsed following the depletion of stocks and damage to primary places of business. Selling and  buying is mostly taking place in the street along with potential barter activities. People, and more particularly vulnerable  groups, are increasingly facing protection risks to access markets with the lack of social order and high levels of food  insecurity. There is a risk associated to transporting and carrying food in the street, especially in Northern Gaza and  Gaza Governorates where people have resorted to going out in groups to buy food and/or carrying knives to protect  themselves. The scarcity of items is driving food prices up and reducing household purchasing power. The overall Consumer Price  index (CPI) was approximately 49 percent higher in December 2023 compared to the onset of the conflict; the CPI for  food and soft drinks was 76 percent higher.38  Food aid.  The flow of humanitarian assistance into and across the Gaza Strip continues to be severely disrupted. Between  1 January and 12 February 2024, 51 percent of aid missions planned for the north of Wadi Gaza and 25 percent of  those planned for the areas requiring coordination south of Wadi Gaza were denied access..39 In February, the UN and its  humanitarian partners planned only 24 missions to areas north of Gaza, of which six (25 percent) were facilitated. This  stands in stark contrast to January, when 61 missions were planned to the north, with nine (15 percent) facilitated.40Figure 5. Stocks availability at shops as of 21 January (% of respondents). Source: WFP<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF10 Based on data from UNRWA,41 the maximum number of trucks entering daily from both the Kerem Shalom and the Rafah  crossings was 300 (compared to an average of 500 daily pre-escalation), approximately 70 percent of these trucks carried  food or a mixture of food and non-food items. On 20 February 2024, WFP decided to suspend its food aid deliveries to  northern Gaza as a result of chaos and violence.42 On 5 March, a 14-truck food convoy, the first by WFP to the north since  it paused deliveries on 20 February, was denied access after a three-hour wait at the Wadi Gaza checkpoint and then  looted on its way back.43  On 7 March, 11 food trucks from private sector were allowed to enter. In total, from 5 February to 5 March, 10-15 food  trucks were allowed into the Gaza Governorate to feed about 300,000 people (less than 1 Kg per person for a full month).  Given the spread of the conflict, restrictions on movement and the displacement of the population, the humanitarian  space is constantly decreasing, and humanitarian food assistance is being distributed unequally among areas.  Airdrop operations of food aid along the Gaza Strip coastline began on 26 February 2024. Airdrops mainly consist of  ready-made meals that do not require cooking methods and are of high nutritional value. However, they are erratic,  small-scale, cover a limited geographic area, and are primarily accessible to populations located near the coast, including  those physically able to recover food pallets and packages from the sea in a context of heightened civil unrest. Airdrops  without ground coordination are also dangerous and falling assistance may strike civilians, as occurred on 8 March when Figure 6. Food CPI in Gaza Strip (December 2022 - December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS Figure 7. Inflation rate (September 2023 vs. December 2023). Source: WFP/ PCBS<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF11 OCHA reported that five civilians died.44 In  light of this, airdrops account for a negligible  share of the humanitarian food security  assistance in the Gaza Strip compared to  what is trucked in overland. Cash Assistance.  The functionality of cash  assistance in the Gaza Strip is limited. As of  15 February 2024, cash actors had delivered  emergency multi-purpose cash assistance  to over 125,000 households (over 828,000  people) since the onset of the conflict.45  According to the most recent Cash Post  Distribution Monitoring,46 about 71 percent  of the respondents reported that the cash  assistance received helped them to either  access urgent/basic items and services  needed. Most expenditures were on food (89 percent), followed by medicines, debt repayment, water and hygiene  products, and transportation. In Rafah, cash liquidity is a significant challenge47 because of the high number of displaced  individuals and the logistical difficulties banks face in transferring cash. Poor electricity supply and connectivity are also  affecting the ability of financial service providers to make cash accessible.   Figure 8. Planned aid missions by month. Source: OCHA  Figure 9a.

Challenges in use of cash, since 7 October 2023 and January 2024. Source: Cash Working Group Figure 10. Quantity of Diesel and Domestic Gas imported per day. Source: UNRWAUtilization  Before the escalation of hostilities, electricity was unreliable and only available for a few hours each day. The lack of  electricity negatively affected all aspects of life, including food safety, and made it almost impossible to operate food  processing units effectively.48 The main water and electricity networks, fuel and food supplies are now almost completely  suspended.49 Frequent communication blackouts make it extremely challenging to coordinate the distribution of aid,  and let people know how to access it, and when.  The complete electricity blackout that began on 11 October 2023 continues, with only limited electricity generated  inside the Gaza Strip from generators and solar panels. Hostilities in the Gaza Strip continue to prevent the delivery of fuel  to the Gaza power plant, which remains non-functioning, and block cross-border electricity distribution.50 This severely  impacts all aspects of daily life, including the processing and storage of food, pumping and distribution of drinking water,  treatment of wastewater, and the functionality of telecommunications and financial systems. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF13 The lack of electricity and damage to telecommunication systems has also limited the ability of populations to  communicate and access information like evacuation orders or humanitarian assistance delivery. There have been rolling  telecommunication blackouts since 7 October, with several lasting around one week.51 Fuel was not permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from 7 October until 15 November 2023. UNRWA reported that for only  the bare minimum of critical services in which it is involved, 160,000 litres per day of diesel fuel are needed. This minimum  requirement, which is still insufficient for a full restoration of humanitarian operations and other basic services, has been  met only about 10 percent of days from 7 October through 9 March. No fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip from  20 December 2023 through 7 January 2024, a period of new or expanding major ground operations, including in Deir  al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates. From 24 January through 6 March, fuel was permitted to enter the Gaza Strip  only on alternative days.52 Even once inside the Gaza Strip, the onward movement of diesel fuel faces the same extreme  challenges as other humanitarian and commercial goods, with little fuel reaching the northern governorates. Regarding fuel to North Wadi Gaza, two (10 percent) of 21 planned missions were facilitated. Both deliveries were  facilitated to a single hospital, leaving other hospitals and WASH facilities without fuel. For fuel to areas South of Wadi  Gaza, 15 (71 percent) of 21 planned missions to areas requiring coordination were facilitated. A total of 300,600 litres were  delivered. However, convoys to Nasser hospital were denied access five times in a row. Fuel shortages in hospitals force  them to cease most operations and may lead to preventable deaths.53 About 250 tons of cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip per day on average from January to August 2023.54 Daily entry into  the Gaza Strip from 24 November 2023 through 10 March 2024 has consistently been roughly 30-40 percent of that pre- escalation amount.55 This has further challenged the ability of the Gaza Strip population to cook food that they are able  to access, presenting challenges to physical and biological utilization. As of January-February 2024, nearly 80 percent of  the population in all governorates reported using firewood as their primary cooking fuel, covering any form of wood  available. Around 10-15 percent of the population across governorates reported burning waste as their main cooking  fuel, while almost no respondents reported using cooking gas. Between 7 and 10 percent of respondents reported  that there was no cooking fuel available.56 This is a particular concern as these populations face major challenges with  consuming food that they may still have access to, in particular flour.  Stability Continued conflict and worsening acute food insecurity and nutritional status also contribute to civil unrest, which  further lowers the stability of all food security dimensions. Civil unrest is a major challenge to the delivery of humanitarian  assistance and to humanitarian staff, and hampers their ability to reach the people in need as well as for the most  vulnerable to access and make full use of assistance.  Recent deaths related to the airdrops and swarming of the trucks entering the Gaza Strip are key evidence of the level  of desperation and acute hunger among the people of Gaza. These also show that even a minimal degree of order to  facilitate access to food and other essential supplies, such as medicines, cannot be guaranteed, given the absence of  civil authorities or organized police. Social cohesion in Gaza is strained, exposing the most vulnerable, such as children  - particularly those who are unaccompanied, women, the elderly, the chronically ill and people living with disabilities to  extreme levels of food and water deprivation.   Food Security Outcomes The most recent WFP survey relied on data collected through Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) between  6 December 2023 and 19 February 2024. The number of observations were: For North Gaza and Gaza Governorates: 104  observations; for Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates: 369 observations; for Rafah Governorate: 892 observations.  Households were randomly selected from a master list of 320,000 WFP pre-conflict beneficiary households representing  80 percent of the total pre-conflict population in the Gaza Strip. Overall, 10,320 households were selected and called.  Of them, 1,365 respondents completed the questionnaires (success rate of 13.3 percent - in line with the 10 percent  to 20 percent typical of CATI analyses in the region), while 19 (0.2 percent) answered the call but hung-up and did not  complete it. The rest did not answer.57<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF14 Food Consumption Score (FCS). According to the survey, most households across the Gaza Strip have inadequate food  consumption with almost 88 percent of households in the North reporting Poor Food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 4 and 5, Emergency and Catastrophe) and 9 percent reporting Borderline food consumption (indicative of IPC  Phase 3, Crisis). An additional disaggregation of the FCS ‘poor’ category (&lt;14) shows that in the North Gaza Governorates,  36 percent of the respondents are not even able to eat cereals daily. In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah around 53 percent of  households reported poor consumption and 31 percent reported borderline consumption, among them 11 percent had  a value below 14. In Rafah, around 48 percent of households reported poor food consumption and 31 percent reported  borderline consumption of which 5 percent had a value below 14.58 Across all governorates, the food consumption  gaps are clear as most households are unable to consume cereals daily. In the north, the mean number of days of cereal  consumption is 4.4 per week, in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates and Rafah Governorate the mean number  of days is 5.14 and 5.15, respectively. Consumption of protein rich food is extremely low in Northern Gaza at 0.33 days a  week and a little over one day a week in the rest of the Gaza Strip.  Reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Results from reduced coping strategies index indicates that nearly 100 percent of  respondents in the Gaza Strip are engaging in extreme coping strategies. The indicator assesses the frequency with which  households resorted to coping strategies that altered their consumption patterns such as reducing meals, restricting  consumption by adults for children to eat, and borrowing food, in the previous week to cover gaps in their consumption.  Household Hunger Scale (HHS). An increase in the proportion of households facing extreme food consumptions gaps is  observed across all analysed governorates when compared with November 2023 data. About 84 percent of households  in Northern Gaza (Gaza and North Gaza) experienced ‘very severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), while  8 percent of households reported ‘severe hunger’ , indicative of IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Compared with the previous  survey round, the deterioration has been significant. In November the proportion of households with ‘very severe hunger’  was estimated at 40 percent showing a doubling of households facing extreme food consumption gaps indicative of IPC  Phase 5 (Catastrophe). In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, 57 percent of households reported experiencing  ‘very severe hunger’ , while 24 percent reported to experience ‘severe hunger’ , compared with November 2023 when only  22 percent of households faced ‘very severe hunger’ . In Rafah, the proportion households reportedly experiencing ‘very  severe hunger’ was 56 percent and 21 percent reporting ‘severe hunger’ .59 Livelihood coping. Some indirect evidence on livelihood coping mechanisms was collected focusing on emergency  strategies contextualised for the very specific conditions of Gaza. The data indicates the highest use of extreme coping  strategies in the North with 18 percent of households reporting that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, while  12 percent reported begging for food. As estimated 3 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food, and 18 percent  reported gathering wild foods. Around 23 percent reported looting food from debris, and 74 percent indicated that  they sought food outside their shelter, facing potential security risks. In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, the reported  proportions were similar: 24 percent of households reported that they bartered/exchanged clothing for food, and in  Rafah the proportion was 27 percent. Around 7 percent in Khan Younis, Deir al-Balah and Rafah Governorates reported  begging for food. An estimated 1.8 percent reported scavenging due to lack of food and 15 percent gathering wild foods.  Around 5 percent in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, and 6 percent in Rafah Governorate reported looting  food from debris. Finally, 65 percent of the households in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates, and 59 percent in  Rafah Governorate reported that they sought food outside their shelter facing potential security risks. The survey detected  a high level of non-applicable strategies, which might indicate the pure exhaustion of these coping mechanisms.  Household Economy Approach (HEA) Outcome Analysis (OA): Preliminary HEA Outcome Analysis was made available  by FEWS NET for this IPC analysis. For the northern governorates (North Gaza and Gaza urban area), for the period of  February – August 2024, all the wealth groups categories living in these governorates are expected to face high level of  Survival Deficits (SD), indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). The SD is calculated compared to a survival threshold  defined as the amount of food and cash income needed by the households to meet the 2,100 Kcal per day per person. This  also include the cost of preparing and consuming food plus any cash expenditure on water for human consumption.60  The only exception in these results appear for the Better Off (BO) wealth group living in the Semi Agriculture Gaza (SAG)  livelihood zone with livelihoods more related to crops sales, livestock sales or self-employment, that will experience SD  Indicative of an IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), at the limit of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For Southern Gaza, the level of  deficit for the projected period of April – August 2024 for the households living in urban areas (URB livelihood zone), will  be indicative of an IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). For the households living in this governorate with livelihoods more related  to agricultural labour, crop and livestock sales or self-employment, (SAG livelihood zone) – that represent a small portion  of the population living in this governorate -, the Very Poor and the Poor wealth groups will face SD indicative of an IPC <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF15 Figure 11.

This last  deficit is calculated compared to a Livelihood Protection basket that include all the sources of food and income needed  for the households to maintain their local livelihoods.  Gender lens.  Food insecurity has a multidimensional impact on women, as it not only relates to unequal access to,  distribution of, consumption of, and control over food, but it also has long-term health and safety risks.  UN Women data  shows that the escalation in food insecurity has also increased the vulnerability of women to food insecurity. More than  4 out of 5 women (84 percent) interviewed by UN Women report that their family eats half or less of the food they used  to before the conflict  began, with mothers and adult women being those tasked with sourcing food, yet eating last,  less, and least than everyone else. Moreover, 4 in 5 women (84 percent) in Gaza indicate that at least one of their family  members had to skip meals during the past week. In 95 percent of those cases, mothers are the ones going without food,  skipping at least one meal to feed their children. Nearly 9 in 10 women (87 percent) report finding it harder to access food  than men. Some women are now resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, such as scavenging for food under rubble  or in dumpsters.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF16Area Governorate % of total Gaza populationURB LZ SAG LZ % of governorate HHs with kcal gaps indicative  of IPC 5 % of area (northern/southern) with kcal gaps  indicative of IPC 5Estimated % of population in the LZ  (URB) Very Poor (24% of the LZ population)  Survival Deficit (SD), Indicative IPC Phase Poor (33%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (41%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (4%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Estimated % of population in the LZ  (SAG) Very Poor (32%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Poor (37%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Middle (25%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase Better Off (7%) SD, Indicative IPC Phase SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 1 (FEBRUARY - AUGUST 2024)Northern Gaza North Gaza5% 100%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 50% N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 100,0%Gaza5% 94%85%,  Phase 585%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 555%,  Phase 56%86%,  Phase 587%,  Phase 584%,  Phase 549%,  Phase 4100%Southern Gaza Deir al Balah (or  middle Gaza)10% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferred To be inferred based on Khan Younis and Deir al Balah assumptions  and convergence of other data higlighting where and to what  extent conditions resemble Rafah vs. Northern GazaKhan  Younis21% 99% N/A N/A N/A N/A 1% N/A N/A N/A N/ATo be  inferredRafah59% 97%33%  survival  deficit,  Phase 432%  survival  deficit,  Phase 445%  survival  deficit,  Phase 427%  survival  deficit,  Phase 43%13%  survival  deficit,  100%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival  deficit,  89%  liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 30%  survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10% survival/ liveli - hoods  pro- tection  deficit,  Phase 10,0% SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024) SCENARIO 2 (APRIL - AUGUST 2024)simulation -  Rafah invasion 59% 97%67% 64% 63% 54% 3%42% 31% 0% 0%  Phase 5 Phase  5 Phase 5 Phase  5Phase 4 Phase 4 Phase 1 Phase 1<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF17 NUTRITION SITUATION Inadequate dietary intake According to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster in December  2023-January 2024,61 in North Gaza, 98 percent of the children (47 observations) included in the analysis had consumed  two or fewer food groups in the 24 hours preceding the survey. Among the main food groups reported, breastmilk was  mentioned for 39 children (83 percent), and eggs for 17 (36 percent). The consumption of all the other food groups,  such as legumes, vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables, other vegetables, grains, meat and dairy products, had almost  completely disappeared from their daily diet, indicating an extremely worrying situation in terms of diet quality. 95  percent of the pregnant and breastfeeding women had consumed two or fewer food groups the previous day. The  main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables, grains and eggs. This situation highlights critically  insufficient micronutrient intake before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both women and the  development of their infants.  In Khan Younis, 90 percent of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women consumed two food groups or  fewer in the last 24 hours. For young children, the food groups most frequently mentioned were breastmilk and eggs,  while grains, pulses and eggs were the food groups most frequently mentioned for pregnant and breastfeeding women.  In Deir al-Balah, 86 percent of young children had eaten two or fewer food groups during the day before the survey, while  only 3 percent had consumed five food groups. The food groups most consumed were breastmilk, followed by eggs and  grains. Among pregnant and breastfeeding women, 67 percent consumed only one food group the day preceding the  survey, while 26 percent consumed two food groups. Pulses, grains and other vegetables were the food groups most  frequently mentioned by respondents.  In Rafah, 88 percent (UNICEF) – 89 percent (CATI) of young children had consumed two or fewer food groups within the  past 24 hours, breastmilk, eggs and grains were the main food groups consumed by young children. Only 3 percent had  eaten more than two food groups in the last 24 hours.  Infant and young child feeding practices Neonates face deteriorating nutritional status if mothers are unable to breastfeed due to stress, poor mental health and/ or inadequate breastfeeding privacy, and lack of counselling and support by healthcare providers.62 Further, the high pre- conflict prevalence of formula use among Gazans (58 percent among under six-month-old infants) raises concerns with  regards to potential supply disruptions. Under poor WASH conditions, keeping formula water, teats, and bottles sterile  is very challenging. These disruptions can result in increased incidence of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases, both  of which further exacerbate malnutrition. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is projected to average between 25  percent to 35 percent under a ceasefire scenario (lower than the pre-conflict baseline of 42 percent, reflecting ongoing  disruptions including overcrowding and worsened mental health), falling to 20 percent to 30 percent under a status quo  scenario and 5 percent to 15 percent under the escalation scenario. These disruptions have enduring consequences on  infant and child health. Based on interviews that WFP conducted with eight key informants (four interviews were held  on 11 January, and the remaining interviews were conducted on 22-23 January), widespread weight loss, diseases, and  malnutrition prevail due to insufficient food supplies, intensifying the health crisis in the Gaza Strip.63  Health There are now only four hospitals and two clinics remaining in Gaza Governorate and two hospitals and two clinics in  North Gaza. All of them operate at a very low level and information on the health status of children under five is close to  absent. The survey conducted did not reach a minimum sample allowing exploitation of the information.  In Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates, according to the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis, more  than 97 percent of children under five reported having had one or more diseases in the past two weeks. 56 percent  of the children under five had experienced Acute Respiratory Infections within the past two weeks, 70.5 percent had  experienced diarrhoea, and 82.3 percent had had a fever. This shows the extremely critical health conditions children  face, exposing them to high-risk nutritional deterioration. Trends from WHO corroborate these findings, showing a 55  percent increase in diarrhoea cases in children under five between November-December 2023. While the three hospitals  in the Governorate of Deir al-Balah were still operational in late November, nine of the 16 Primary Health Care Centres  (PHCCs) were no longer functioning, seriously impeding access to health services. On average, 0.49 litres of drinking water <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF18 was available per person per day in the households surveyed, which is far from the minimum humanitarian standard (2L/ person/day).35 The scale of needs is staggering with 100 percent of the 49 households in need of food and hygiene items,  78 percent in need of water, 69 percent shelter, and 65 percent health assistance.  In Rafah, the Nutrition Vulnerability and Situation Analysis also shows extreme health conditions with almost 93 percent  of children under five having one or more disease within the past two weeks, 79 percent had had a fever and 56 percent  had experienced vomiting. The level of diarrhoea is extremely critical with 70 percent of children under five having had  one episode in the past two weeks, and almost 60 percent having ARI (Acute Respiratory Infection).64  Since mid-October, 388,200 cases of acute respiratory infections have been recorded, along with 246,000 cases of diarrhea  and 3,300 cases of bloody diarrhea, 84,000 cases of skin rashes, 12,000 cases of Acute Jaundice (including confirmed  Hepatitis A).65 As per OCHA, 1.9 million IDPs face at high risk of communicable disease due overcrowding of IDP sites and  lack of access to proper water sanitation and hygiene facilities.66 In Gaza, cases of Hepatitis A have been confirmed in  January 2024 and WHO warned that inhumane living conditions will enable Hepatitis A to continue to spread.67  Health system functionality.  In February 2024, attacks against healthcare facilities, infrastructure and services continued  resulting in 58 percent of the hospitals are not functioning in the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates  (75 percent of the hospitals not functioning). According to the Health Cluster, as of 5 March 2024, only 2 hospitals and  no Primary Health Care Centres were fully functioning; 14 hospitals and 20 Primary Health Care Centres were partially  functioning; while 23 hospitals and 62 Primary Health Centres were not functioning. Only 141 medical points in shelters  were available, while 264 informal, public and UNRWA shelters did not have a medical centre available.68 In the northern governorates, hospitals have been offering limited maternity, trauma, surgery and emergency care services.  They also face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive  care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water.69 In Deir al-Balah  and Khan Younis, according to OCHA, since January 2024, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – were at  risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. In  Rafah, 5 hospitals are still functioning. The influx of IDPs migrating to Rafah has overwhelmed the bed availability in hospitals,  leading to insufficient capacity to meet the healthcare needs of the population. There is also high need for primary health  services in informal shelters hosting IDPs. The continued besiegement around some hospitals is significantly affecting their  case management capacity. Referring patients outside of Gaza remains a challenge, as the waiting list continues to grow.70 In addition, people are unable to effectively access healthcare due to the lack of laboratory equipment and reagents  needed for accurate diagnosis and testing.71 The risk to public health is intensified due to an acute scarcity of hygiene  materials and adequate sanitation infrastructure. Persistent anecdotal reports of Hepatitis A cases in Gaza, as recorded  by UNRWA and the Health Cluster, highlight ongoing concerns. Limited access to proper WASH facilities is hindering  prevention of diseases. The high number of surgeries and procedures has led to increased demand for anaesthetic and  analgesic medications which are in short supply. Blood and blood products in hospitals are needed for emergencies and  medical procedures to ensure that patients receive timely transfusions.72  Figure 1. Gaza disease surveillance Source: WHO, Health Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF19 UNRWA stocks of medicines continue to decrease, with around 15 days’ supply remaining overall and one week’s supply  of insulin; some items may run out sooner based on needs at shelters. Therefore, there is an urgent need to restock  medical supplies given the depletion of stocks in the local market. Stocks of fuel and medicines continue to be at risk  of depletion halting UNRWA operations at the health centres. Essential medicines and other critical medical supplies  remain difficult to bring into the Gaza Strip due to strict control of allegedly dual-use items at border crossings and wider  challenges with importing controlled drugs. As basic and specialty healthcare services in Gaza continue to deteriorate,  an increase in excess deaths due to traumatic injuries that would otherwise be survivable with timely and appropriate  care is expected.   In December 2023, UNICEF delivered 962,550 doses of essential vaccines, including for measles, pneumonia, and polio.  Opening of stabilization centres for acute malnutrition cases with medical complications are also planned notably in Tal  as Sultan (Rafah) and another in one of the field hospitals.73 Heightened insecurity and limited access to health facilities  continue to present major challenges for partners to respond and partner operations continue to be negatively affected  by the displacement of staff, social stresses and telecommunication challenges.74   Water, sanitation, and hygiene  Prior to the escalation of hostilities, the majority of the water supply in the Gaza Strip came from groundwater sources  and the rest (around 20 percent) from desalination plants and cross border pipelines. The over pumping of groundwater  in Palestine led to severe water pollution and salinization, especially in the Gaza Strip. More than 97 percent of the water  pumped from the coastal aquifer in the Gaza Strip did not meet the water quality standards set by WHO (PCBS and PWA,  2021).75 Figure 13.

Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF20 Nitrate levels already exceeded 150 mg/litre  in most areas of the Gaza Strip, which made  the water undrinkable, given the World Health  Organization (WHO) acceptable limit of 50  mg/litre.  In 2019, the daily allocation of water  per capita for domestic purposes was 77 litres/  capita in the Gaza Strip.77 Taking the high  percentage of water pollution in the Gaza Strip  and calculating the quantity of water suitable  for human use, the per capita share of fresh  water was 22.4 litres per day.78 Damage to WASH facilities.  Based on satellite  damage assessments on WASH infrastructure  dated 21 February,79 13 percent of all sewage  and water facilities have been destroyed (7  percent and 14 percent respectively), while  in total over 56 percent have been either  destroyed or damaged (13 percent and 34  percent respectively). Another 11 percent are  assessed to have possible damage. Overall, this  assessment identifies 77 facilities destroyed  and 254 facilities damaged, with another 67  facilities with possible damage. Northern  Gaza and Gaza Governorates have the highest  concentration of reported damaged or  destroyed infrastructure.  The functionality of, or access to, the 194  facilities (38 and 156 respectively) that were  found with no visible damage is conditional  to access to fuel and spare parts, which are  in very limited supply, as well as availability  of technicians and access to areas with  these assets. The combined damaged and  conditional access to the remaining WASH  infrastructure is expected to have a profound  impact on the availability of water, water  quality and presence of unsafe water or contaminants for populations in these areas. Water availability and drinking water. Water availability continues to be a major concern across the Gaza Strip. In  February 2024, the water produced from all the water sources in Gaza accounted for only 5.7 percent of the pre-escalation  production levels.80 According to OCHA, only 17 percent of the 284 groundwater wells are operating with limited hours  and 39 wells have been reported as destroyed and 93 as moderately to severely damaged.81 Still according to OCHA,  only one of the three cross border water pipelines is operating, functioning at 47 percent of its capacity. Plans to repair  the non-functioning pipelines face challenges in terms of access, communication, or repair coordination considering the  current context. The United Arab Emirate’s small desalination plant located on the Egyptian side of Rafah, operates at full  capacity, providing 2,400 cubic metres per day, following the construction of a 3-kilometre transmission line. In addition,  only two out of the three main water desalination plants are partially functional, mainly in the southern governorates.82   Water quality appears low due to lack of processing facilities or other way of contamination.  According to another study (sample size of 1,200 people)83 conducted in the Gaza Strip in February 2024, access to water  for drinking, bathing and cleaning, is estimated at 1.5 litre per person per day compared to the 15 litres minimum amount  of water required for survival as per as the international SPHERE standards. Similar results from the WASH cluster rapid  assessment conducted in 41 sites indicate a median value of 2 litres per person per day.84 Water production and distribution is a fuel intensive process and the overall WASH fuel allocation is currently 30,000 litres  per day. From 24 January through 4 March, the WASH sector in the Gaza Strip accounted for 30 percent to 60 percent Map 5. WASH facilities damaged, February 2024. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF21 of all fuel entering the Gaza Strip, with limitations on diesel fuel entry a major impediment to meeting minimum water  requirements throughout the Gaza Strip, especially in the northern governorates.85 In the northern governorates, water supply remains limited and no access to clean water has been reported.86 According  to OCHA, as of 12 January 2024, the combination of water trucking, water from the functional desalination plant, and the  restoration of one of the three main water supply lines on 30 December 2023, has yielded only seven percent of water  production in Gaza, compared with the pre-October 2023 supply.87 In Rafah Governorate, according to the WASH cluster rapid assessment, the majority of the sites rely mainly on water  trucking and piped water in scattered sites, and collective centres rely more heavily on wells.88 More than half of the  sites provide water that is unsafe for drinking (67 percent in collective centres) and only 12 percent can provide water  treatment at source. According to the Euromed study, in Rafah Governorate out of the 15 litres minimum amount of  water a day required as per sphere standard, only 8 litres are available on average across sites (3 litres in collective centres),  with a median of 2 litres per person per day, indicating high level of disparities among sites. Hygiene.  According to the WASH cluster, in Rafah, 61 percent of the sites in collective centres and 71 percent in scattered  sites have no shower89 and the average number of showers per person is about 3,500 in collective centres and 1,050 in  scattered sites. Access and protection of most vulnerable population is also of high concern, with only 12 percent of the  showers being accessible for people living with disabilities and only 24 percent of the sites having separated showers for  women (14 percent in collective centres).  Figure 15. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF22 An NRC assessment90 conducted in nine shelters in Rafah also stated that every assessed location had reported cases of  “hepatitis A, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, smallpox, lice, [and] influenza.”  Solid Waste Management. In terms of waste management, most of the wastewater treatment systems have been  suspended and non-functioning since November 2023, due to damage, lack of fuel/power supply, and lack of  maintenance.91 Regarding solid-waste management, which was already a crucial issue before the escalation, the last  UNRWA update on 16 January states that solid waste management continues in Rafah and Khan Younis Governorates  and partially in Deir al-Balah Governorate, where approximately 45 truck loadings were transferred to temporary sites.92  However, according to the WASH cluster,93 93 percent of the sites (89 percent in collective centres and 100 percent in  scattered sites) have some type of visible waste, mainly solid waste or trash and 68 percent of all the sites present informal  or uncontrolled dumping areas. The accumulation of tens of thousands of tons of solid waste on the streets, around  hospitals, IDP shelters, and various random dump sites, represent high public health risks. The Gaza Municipality also  estimates that approximately 50,000 tons of solid waste remain unmanaged.94Figure 16. Quantity and type of water sources per site. Source: WASH cluster Figure 17. Waste management. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF23 Sanitation. Sanitation situation continues to deteriorate and remains a major issue in all governorates. Despite significant  efforts by UNICEF and its partners to construct family latrines, sanitation coverage remains very low and efforts to increase  coverage are hindered by a lack of cement and other construction materials, including due to constraints on the entry of  items considered to be dual use into the Gaza Strip.95  With wastewater treatment plants non-functioning and many sewage facilities destroyed, especially in Gaza city, flooding  has been a major health hazard through the rainy period as floodwater mixes with untreated sewage in urban areas with  dense displaced populations.96 This is further compounded by the enduring fuel shortage, which impedes the operation  of remaining sewage stations and wastewater treatment plants. According to the WASH Cluster, there is also an increasing  concern about the potential for additional flooding of already contaminated rainwater harvesting lagoons, particularly if  rainfall intensifies. This situation poses a critical threat to both the environment and public health.97 In early 2023, UNICEF  reported that “insufficient safely managed water supply to households, poor sanitation, limited public WASH services, and  risk of flooding expose 1.36 million Palestinians to water-related diseases risks” .98 The situation is exacerbated by continuous restricted access to essential sanitation supplies and services in Gaza.99 The  inability to transport sufficient fuel into the Gaza Strip, and especially to the northern governorates, also significantly  compounds the challenges faced by the WASH response.100  A rapid assessment of displacement sites, including scattered sites and collective centres, in Rafah Governorate was  conducted by the WASH cluster in February 2024.101 63 percent of assessed sites reportedly had access to a sewer  connection (78 percent in collective centres and 36 percent in scattered sites). Few sites reported using buckets/plastic  bags, flush to open drain, septic tank, or flush to elsewhere as a sanitation facility. The median number of persons per  toilet across all sites was 341, though 994 in collective centres and 57 in scattered sites. 80 percent of the 41 sites had  non-functional latrines (74 percent in collective centers and 93 percent in scattered sites). Only 15 percent of sites had  handwashing facilities near latrines. 24 percent of assessed sites offered safe and private latrine access and 51 percent  had separate facilities for men and women. Sanitation facilities in collective centres and informal sites are overcrowded also due to the high number of displaced  populations. According to UNRWA, on average, there are 1,109 IDPs per toilet in shelters in Rafah Governorate, 619 IDPs  per toilet in shelters in Deir al-Balah Governorate, and 1,349 IDPs per toilet in Khan Younis Governorate.102 UNRWA also  reports that there are at least 486 people per toilet in UNRWA shelters in Rafah Governorate.103 Figure 18. Sanitation quantities. Source: WASH Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF24 Figure 19. Sanitation facilities. Source: WASH Cluster Summary of Acute Malnutrition Drivers  According to the Nutrition Vulnerability Study,104 conducted by the Global Nutrition Cluster, over 90 percent of children  aged 6-23 months and pregnant and breastfeeding women are eating two or fewer food groups each day, often those  of the lowest nutritional value. At least 90 percent of children under five have had at least one infectious disease, with 70  percent having had diarrhoea in the previous two weeks. Against a minimum standard of 15 litres per person, 81 percent  of households lack safe and clean water, with average daily household access to water reportedly less than one litre per  person per day. This extreme lack of safe water access is especially concerning for the greater number of infants now  reliant on infant formula than before the most recent escalation. Low clean water availability and access further exposes  young children to infection and subsequently malnutrition. Figure 20: Acute malnutrition drivers. Source: Global Nutrition Cluster<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF25 Nutrition Outcomes There is very limited data on acute malnutrition available in Gaza since the start of the conflict on 7 October 2023. The  only data that is available on acute malnutrition as of 9 Mar 2024 come from Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)  screenings conducted in the three IPC AFI units of analysis, i.e. northern, middle and southern governorates. While some  screenings included children 6-59 months, others almost exclusively measured only children between 6 and 23 months  of age. Additionally, although some screenings contained individual MUAC and age data, others only had MUAC data at  aggregate level. Of the screening data made available for the analysis, one set only included 45 children and therefore  was not considered in the analysis. The remaining screening datasets were analysed as follows: Figure 21. Metadata, MUAC screening results. Source: Various - reanalysis conducted by the Global Smart Team For every screening that contained only aggregate MUAC data on children 6-59 months, first, unweighted prevalence  estimates were calculated for the following age groups: (i) 6-59 months, (ii) 6-23 months, and (iii) 24-59 months. Secondly,  weighted prevalence of MUAC among children between 6-59 months were calculated from the unweighted prevalence  estimates of children 6-23 months and 24-59 months by applying weights of 0.33 and 0.66,105 respectively. Finally, the  weighted prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference  table and the IPC AMN Phases were determined. For each screening that only contained aggregate MUAC data on children 6-23 months, the MUAC prevalence of children  between 23-59 months and weighted prevalence of MUAC among children 6-59 months were estimated using the  following procedure. First, using data from screenings that contained MUAC data on children 6-59 months, the ratio  between the MUAC prevalence of 6-23 months and 24-59 months was determined (this ranged from 3.07 to 9.68).  Secondly, using sensitivity analysis, expected ranges of MUAC prevalence among children between 24-59 months were  calculated using the lowest (3.07) and the highest (9.68) empirically observed ratios. Thirdly, a weighted analysis was  performed, and a range of weighted prevalence estimates of children 6-59 months were obtained. Finally, the weighted  prevalence estimates of 6-59 months were compared with the IPC Acute Malnutrition (IPC AMN) reference table and the  possible IPC AMN Phases were determined.<br/><br/> THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF26 In conclusion:     •   In North Gaza Governorate , MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 2 - 3 (Alert  - Critical) in January, having rapidly deteriorated to an indicative IPC AMN Phase of 4 - 5 (Critical - Extremely  Critical) in February 2024.     •   In Khan Younis Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 3 - 4 (Serious -  Critical) in February 2024.      •   In Deir al-Balah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable  - Alert) in February – early March 2024.      •   In Rafah Governorate, MUAC screenings are indicative of an IPC Acute Malnutrition Phase 1 - 2 (Acceptable - Alert)  in late January – early March.

The data available consisted in death counts issued by the Gaza Ministry of Health  and reported by the Health Cluster, and interview data collected during CATI surveys conducted by WFP . Furthermore, a  study on mortality and public health106 was conducted to inform humanitarian and other decision-makers working on  the Gaza crisis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns  Hopkins University (LSHTM).  The mortality data collected by the Ministry of Health are not disaggregated by area and appears to only be those  attributable to conflict related violence. The WFP CATI survey data results can be disaggregated by area but not by cause  of death. Therefore, no direct measurements of CDR or U5DR after trauma exclusion are currently available. Nonetheless, it worths noticing that the modelled projections published by LSHTM, while considered useful for  indicating the expected direction of travel and scale of the expected excess mortality, the IPC Famine Review Committee  (FRC) found some of the assumptions factored in the study published in early February might have evolved in different  directions, especially regarding food intake estimates and acute malnutrition.   The absence of usable mortality data in  both governorates leaves a high degree of uncertainty on the translation of these acute malnutrition rate into children  and adult mortality in the current period in North Gaza. It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet  translated into 2/10,000/day Crude Death Rate. The likelihood of having surpassed U5DR thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF28 PROJECTED SITUATION MAP AND POPULATION TABLE                                                            (16 March - 15 July 2024 ) Note: A population in Phase 3+ does not necessarily reflect the full population in need of urgent action.

Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.  The Governorates of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, and the  Governorate of Rafah, are classified in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).   During the projection period (16 March - 15 July), in the most likely  scenario and under the assumption of an escalation of the conflict  including a ground offensive in Rafah, half of the population of  the Gaza Strip (1,107,000 people) is expected to face IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), the most severe level in the IPC Acute Food Insecurity  scale. The rest of the population is likely to be either in Emergency (IPC  Phase 4) (854,000 people, 38 percent of the population) or in Crisis  (265,000 people, 12 percent of the population). During this period, the  whole population of the Gaza Strip (2,230,000 people) will face high  levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). North Gaza and Gaza Governorates In the most likely scenario, the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates  are classified in IPC Phase 5 (Famine), with reasonable evidence.  Famine is imminent and likely to occur within the next two months.   In terms of magnitude, 70 percent of the population is likely to be in  IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) and 30 percent in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). Continued conflict and the near-complete lack of access to the  northern governorates for humanitarian organizations and commercial  trucks will likely compound heightened vulnerabilities and extremely  limited food availability, access, and utilization, as well as access to  healthcare, water, and sanitation services. People’s ability to exit the  northern governorates and move to locations with relatively greater  food availability and access is likely to be very limited. Within the north, displacements are likely to remain frequent and  localized; yet conditions in the shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs.  As food stocks or sources (wild foods, livestock, or other types of food  – from domestic stocks, shelters or agricultural assets) will continue to  reduce, food availability is expected to be limited. With the very few  humanitarian and commercial trucks entering these governorates,  it is unlikely that households will be able to restock or stabilize their  food consumption patterns. Due to scarce food availability, the vast  majority of markets are either not functioning or availing very few Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in North Gaza and Gaza Governorates Conflict:  In the most likely scenario, the pop - ulation will likely remain fully exposed and  highly susceptible to conflict. Conflict and  related casualties will likely continue at simi - lar levels to January-February 2024, including  the wider besiegement, neighbourhood-lev - el clearing operations, occasional armed  actor clashes, and a comparable rate of  bombardment (air, land, sea). Basic services  infrastructure will likely remain extremely de - graded, and the proportion of all buildings  damaged or destroyed will likely continue to  steadily approach 100%. Humanitarian access to provide food, water,  medicines, and provision of health and  WASH services:  The northern governorates  are likely to be mostly inaccessible and  intermittently hard-to-reach, given continued  ground operations, bombardment (air, land,  sea), civil unrest, bureaucratic impediments,  and physical obstruction. The humanitarian  space in the northern governorates will  continue to be extremely restricted, thereby  hampering the provision of the necessary  supplies and services to the most vulnerable  population. It will also hamper the capacity  of humanitarian actors to monitor closely  the situation on the ground and to intervene  promptly to provide relief.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue  to worsen, including due to intense and  widespread conflict, largely insufficient  basic service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will increasingly  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance within  the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  remain frequent and localized and conditions  in shelters will continue to deteriorate,  including extreme deprivation of basic needs. food commodities at excessively high prices. As a result, communities’ coping capacity and social cohesion will be further  strained. Social tensions are also likely to increase putting the most vulnerable at higher risk of exposure to violence and  lower access to food. Physical access to markets is also of concern, due to restrictions of civilian mobility and conflict  intensity. Utilization of food resources will also be heavily impacted as seasonal higher temperatures reduce food storage  options in a context of no or extremely limited access to electricity, fuel and/or gas to preserve, process or cook food.  The lack of access to sufficient and safe water, sanitation facilities and health services is likely to increase the risk of cholera  and the spread of infectious diseases impacting people’s nutrition and health status and increasing mortality from non- trauma related causes. The restoration of public services will be a major challenge given that the majority of WASH  facilities and infrastructure are damaged or destroyed. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF30 FRC analysis of acute malnutrition trends A detailed analysis of the drivers (risk factors) for acute malnutrition and the available data on nutritional status was provided by  the Global Nutrition Cluster report on Nutrition Vulnerability in February 2024.7 Based on this report and their own analysis the  IPC Analysis Team concluded that the key driver of acute malnutrition in the North Gaza governorate was the highly inadequate  dietary diversity in Children 6–23m, with 79% consuming ≤2 food groups, 8 and also in Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women,  with 95% consuming ≤2 food groups. The main food groups mentioned were non-vitamin A rich vegetables (24 affirmations),  grains (20) and eggs (17). This situation highlights critically insufficient diet diversity and micronutrient intake before and during  pregnancy and breastfeeding, which can affect both the women and the development of their infants. Infant and Young Chil - dren Feeding practices are highly constrained by the lack of resources and health seeking behavior is also highly constrained.  Interviews conducted by the FRC with key informants and a review of available reports confirmed that the situation in the  northern governates during the current analysis period was similar to that reported by the Analysis Team. The health and WASH  situations are also considered separately belo w. Figure 23: Trends in GAM by MUAC Prevalence in North Gaza (children aged 6-59 mo.) Within the IPC unit of analysis, MUAC screening data9 was available from the North Governorate but not from Gaza City. The  available data was collected as part of a vaccination programme and measurements were only taken from children aged 6-23  months. The FRC explored different methods for using this data to estimate the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in children aged  6-59 months. This was a necessary step to allow the classification of malnutrition according to IPC Phases. To provide a starting point for the trend analysis the prevalence of GAM by MUAC in North Gaza in 2023, before October 7th,  was estimated at 1%. This is consistent with previous studies.11 Age-adjustment of the MUAC screening data resulted in a GAM  by MUAC prevalence in January 2024 of 6.8% to 9.1%. By February this had risen to give a range of 12.4% to 16.5%, indicating a  very steep increase in the incidence of acute malnutrition in children 6-59 mo. To estimate what the prevalence would be at the  time of the current analysis in March 2024, two nowcasting scenarios were examined.  Given the extremely poor situation regarding the drivers of malnutrition, the best-case scenario was that there had been a  continued linear increase in prevalence, while the more likely scenario was that the rate of increase would have followed the  observed trend and have increased further in the time since the February screening. These two scenarios were then applied to  the high and low estimates for age-adjusted GAM by MUAC prevalence, resulting in the four dotted lines shown in Figure 2. This  analysis indicates that in all scenarios the GAM by MUAC prevalence had passed the IPC Phase 4/5 threshold (Critical/Extremely  Critical) in the current analysis period. Given the current trajectory in MUAC prevalence data it is clear that the Famine threshold  for acute malnutrition prevalence, measured using weight-for-height Z-scores, may have already been crossed or will be crossed  imminently. These data were collected exclusively in North Gaza governorate.Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including due to lack of humanitarian access and  inadequate delivery of critical supplies, as well as a decline in the functionality of the few remaining health centres. The risk  of infectious diseases will likely continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall health environment.  In line with the Famine Review Committee findings, people’s livelihoods and food consumption are likely to continue  deteriorating, resulting in more than two thirds of the population (70 percent) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Acute Malnutrition will increase at a high pace as already observed in the past few weeks (current period) and  mortality levels will likely breach the Famine thresholds (extremely critical) - by the end of May 2024.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF31 Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates These Governorates are projected to remain in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency), though with half of the population (300,000  people) in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), up from 30 percent in the  current period; and the other half (300,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency). While this unit of analysis includes both Governorates,  the conditions for the population in Khan Younis Governorate are  expected to be worse than those in Deir al-Balah.  The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely be a major driver of deterioration in Khan Younis and Deir  al-Balah Governorates, including through an influx of displaced  populations – many already displaced multiple times – into parts  of these Governorates and the impact of the ground operation  on humanitarian access. Ground operations are likely to continue  throughout Khan Younis Governorate and in eastern Deir al-Balah  Governorate.  Displacement will likely escalate with large populations moving into  the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis Governorate and into Deir al- Balah Governorate, especially in and around Deir al-Balah city and  camp. Further displacement will likely stress already highly limited  resources and basic services, exacerbating existing conditions. Shelter  conditions are likely to deteriorate with continued deprivation of  basic needs.  Food availability and access are expected to further decline as the  major ground operation in Rafah Governorate reduces humanitarian  and commercial traffic into and throughout the Gaza Strip. This will  be exacerbated by continued civil unrest outside the Kerem Shalom  crossing, which will likely further reduce humanitarian and commercial  truck entry. Fewer humanitarian convoys to these governorates are  expected, including those unsuccessfully attempting to reach the  northern governorates and offloading assistance in Deir al-Balah  instead.  The already limited agricultural production, mostly of vegetables,  observed in the current period will likely continue to decline as  ground operations are pursued within and near production areas of  both governorates, especially in all areas of Khan Younis Governorate;  and the harvest period for several vegetables comes to an end.  Market functionality is likely to continue falling as agricultural  production and humanitarian and commercial truck arrivals decline.  Civilian mobility is likely to be severely constrained, further reducing  access to food, including through coping strategies like gathering  wild foods or scavenging. The end of the typical rainy period may also  limit wild food availability. Compared to other governorates, Deir al-Balah Governorate had  higher food availability in the current period, including due to higher  deliveries of humanitarian food assistance (proportional to estimated Assumptions for the most likely  scenario in Deir al Balah and Khan  Younis Governorates Conflict:  Conflict and related casualties will  likely continue at similar levels to February  2024, including ground operations in mul - tiple but not all urban areas of Deir al-Balah  and throughout Khan Younis governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes especially in  Khan Younis governorate, and a compa - rable rate of bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip  will likely continue. Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Khan Younis and Deir al Balah  governorate - including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to  the most vulnerable populations - is likely  to be intermittently reduced, especially  relative to the higher proportional  delivery of assistance made to Deir al- Balah Governorate compared to other  governorates in early 2024. This decrease  in access is likely due to the onset of major  ground operations in Rafah Governorate,  continued ground operations in Khan  Younis governorate, bombardment (air,  land, sea) in these governorates and within  Deir al-Balah Governorate, and worsening  civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely escalate,  driven by intense and widespread conflict  as well as largely insufficient basic service  provision and humanitarian assistance  delivery. This will likely increasingly inhibit  the transport, distribution, and utilization  of humanitarian assistance throughout the  Gaza Strip.  Displacement: Displacement will likely  escalate, with large populations moving  into the Al-Mawasi area of Khan Younis  governorate and into Deir al Balah  governorate, especially the area of Deir al  Balah city/camp. Shelter conditions will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces. population) in parts of January and February 2024. These deliveries appear to have partially resulted from the offloading  of humanitarian food assistance that could not be delivered to the northern governorates. Any accumulated stocks in  markets and households will provide at least a short-term buffer to some of the people in the early part of the projection  period. Khan Younis Governorate received lower levels of humanitarian food assistance during that period, resulting in  households likely to face larger food consumption gaps from the beginning of the projection period. With no major  improvements in the availability of electricity, fuel, cooking gas, and safe water, food utilization will likely be a major  limiting factor in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorates. This includes challenges to the safe storage and preparation <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF32 Assumptions for the most likely scenario  in Rafah Governorate Conflict:  Conflict will likely escalate, in - cluding the continuation of the wider  besiegement, the onset of a new, major  ground operation throughout Rafah gov - ernorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  with armed actor clashes, and an increase  in bombardment (air, land, sea). Humanitarian access: Humanitarian  access to Rafah Governorate, including  for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, will  likely be intermittently reduced, though  without total access loss to the Rafah  Governorate portion of the Al-Mawasi  area, where an extreme concentration of  displaced people is likely. Loss of access  will be particularly high to populations  remaining within Rafah city during the  major ground operation likely to occur  there. This disruption will likely result from  the onset of major ground operations in  Rafah Governorate, continued ground  operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea),  and civil unrest.  Civil unrest: Civil unrest will likely continue,  including due to intense and widespread  conflict and severely insufficient basic  service provision and humanitarian  assistance delivery. This will continue to  inhibit the transport, distribution, and  utilization of humanitarian assistance  within the Gaza Strip. Displacement: Displacement will likely  increase substantially, with most of the  current population of Rafah city forced  into the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah and Khan  Younis Governorates and into Deir al-Balah  Governorate, especially the area of Deir al- Balah city/camp. Conditions in shelters will  likely continue to deteriorate, including  extreme deprivation of basic needs,  extreme overcrowding, and increased  sheltering in open spaces.of food, lack of safe access to water, and an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, among the  general population. Full resumption of cross border water pipeline activity is unlikely, and the functionality of remaining wells and water  distribution systems will likely decline. Wastewater treatment plants are likely to remain non-functioning. Solid waste  management will continue to be limited. Healthcare availability and access will likely continue to decline, including  due to lack of humanitarian access and inadequate delivery of critical supplies as well as a decline in the functionality of  remaining health centres. Infectious disease risk will continue to increase due to the extreme deterioration of the overall  health environment. Low and declining food availability, access, and utilization will likely  lead to extreme gaps in food consumption and a collapse of coping  capacities for the estimated 300,000 people (50 percent of the  population) experiencing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe); while  large food  consumptions gaps are expected for the 300,00 people (50 percent of  the population) in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency).  With the drivers of acute  malnutrition expected to worsen (infectious diseases expected to  increase, dietary diversity still severely restricted), the nutritional status  of the people of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis will likely continue  to deteriorate towards critical levels of acute malnutrition (IPC AMN  Phase 4) during this period.  Rafah Governorate The onset of a major ground operation in Rafah Governorate will  likely drive a significant increase in acute food insecurity alongside  other severe humanitarian consequences. The situation is projected  to remain in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), though with nearly half (45  percent) of the population (around 600,000 people) in IPC Phase 5  (Catastrophe), up from 25 percent in the current period. The whole  population of Rafah will likely be in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis) or above,  including over one third (about 464,000 people) in IPC Phase 4  (Emergency) and 12 percent (about 265,000 people) in IPC Phase  3 (Crisis). Relative improvement in access into and within Rafah have been  observed compared to the previous analysis, with the opening of a  second border crossing in Kerem Shalom allowing more humanitarian  and commercial supply for aid and markets, However, for the projection  period, considering the most likely scenario of a major ground operation  in Rafah, the humanitarian access and space are likely to reduce due  to the escalating hostilities and populations will face continued and  repeated displacement in search of “safer” areas. As many IDPs already  face poor food security, nutrition, health and WASH outcomes, further  displacement will likely cause further deterioration. Existing mitigation  measures from humanitarian services or programmes are likely to be  disrupted by conflict or sizeable displacements and may cause further  family separation or marginalization of the most vulnerable. Local production will be minimal and difficult to access and agricultural  activities (crop production, livestock herding or fishing) will either not  be pursued or remain very limited due to lack of agricultural inputs,  access to assets or land and geographical concentration of displaced  populations. Further disruptions to market supplies and prices are likely  to continue and decrease access to food through markets. Markets or  traders may be displaced along with the population, impacting their  ability to restock or remain functional, especially as populations move  further away from border crossings and fewer trucks enter the Gaza <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF33 Strip. Market-based interventions will continue to be challenged by high levels of displacement, including of the staff of  financial service providers, and a wider loss of enabling condition, including an adequate electricity supply and functional  telecommunications services, physical cash availability and access, and functioning markets able to absorb any rapid  increases in demand. Physical access to humanitarian assistance and markets will be hindered. There will likely be a disruption in social support  systems (e.g. community kitchens) and increased tensions within the community. Rising temperatures and declining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene will likely lead to challenges in safe food  storage and preparation, and a rise in waterborne diseases or food borne illnesses. Scarcity of firewood will force people  to resort to using unsafe materials, increasing health risks. Explosive remnants will raise concerns about personal, food  and water safety.  Health outcomes and morbidity are expected to deteriorate in this period and even more so with increased overcrowding,  further displacement and/or lower access to health services. A major decrease in food availability, access, and utilization will likely cause extreme gaps in food consumption and  the exhaustion of people’s coping strategies. Acute malnutrition is likely to increase towards IPC AMN Phase 3 (Serious)  as food insecurity, the health environment, and infant and young childcare and feeding practices deteriorate due  to conflict escalation, displacement, and reduced delivery of, and access to multi-sector humanitarian assistance.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF34 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS In comparison to the previous analysis (projection period December 2023 – 7 February 2024), the total share of the  population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) across the Gaza Strip continues to increase, from 26 percent to 30 percent in  the current period (mid-February to mid-March 2024) and 50% in the projection period (mid-March to mid-July). In the  northern governorates, the share of the population in IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) increased from 30 percent to 55 percent  in the current period and 70% in the projected period, representing an increase of about 100,000 people and 530,000  people, respectively.

HHS trends in the Gaza Strip<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF36 RISK OF FAMINE ANALYSIS As per the IPC tools and technical guidance, an IPC statement on the risk of Famine differs from a Famine classification.  While a projected Famine classification is based on the most likely scenario, the risk of Famine refers to the worst case  scenario that has a reasonable and realistic chance of happening. The risk of Famine is only a statement and not a  classification and was designed to complement the standard IPC projections of the most likely scenario by providing  insights of a potential Famine if prospects evolve in a manner worse than anticipated. The elements considered when developing the worst case scenario are described below.  Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Primary Drivers ConflictConflict would escalate to levels seen in  December 2023-January 2024 when a major  ground operation was conducted in Bureij and  Maghazi camps of Deir al-Balah Governorate.  This would include expanding and intensified  ground operations across all central camps  alongside neighbourhood-level clearing  operations throughout Khan Younis Governorate,  frequent armed actor clashes, and increased  bombardment (air, land, sea).. Expanded ground  operations within Deir al-Balah Governorate  would not necessarily be concurrent with a  major ground operation on Rafah. The wider  besiegement of the Gaza Strip would intensify.Conflict would rapidly escalate, including  the onset of a new, wide-ranging, and large- scale ground operation throughout Rafah  Governorate and concentrated on Rafah city,  intense and frequent armed actor clashes, and  a large increase in bombardment (air, land, sea).  The wider besiegement of the Gaza Strip would  intensify. Humanitarian  AccessHumanitarian access, including for the delivery  of life-saving multi-sector assistance to the most  vulnerable populations and data collection,  to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah Governorate  would severely reduce, including due to the  onset of major ground operations in Rafah  Governorate, continued ground operations in  Khan Younis Governorate, the later resumption  of major ground operations in Deir al-Balah  Governorate, intensified bombardment (air, land,  sea), the closure of the Rafah border crossing  and reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse.Humanitarian access to Rafah Governorate,  including for the delivery of life-saving multi- sector assistance to the most vulnerable  populations and data collection, would severely  reduce. Access to populations remaining within  Rafah city during the major ground operation  would be completely lost, while access to the  extreme concentration of displaced people  in the Rafah portion of the Al-Mawasi area  would be intermittent. This disruption would  result from the onset of major, rapid ground  operations in Rafah Governorate, continued  ground operations in Khan Younis Governorate,  intensified bombardment (air, land, sea), the  closure of the Rafah border crossing and  reduction in crossings at Kerem Shalom, and  public order collapse. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF37 Factor/element Risk of Famine Scenario - Deir al-Balah and  Khan Younis GovernoratesRisk of Famine Scenario – Rafah Governorate Secondary Drivers Civil unrestAlready strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and a  wider breakdown of social cohesion. This collapse  would heavily constrain humanitarian operations  through reducing access and inhibiting the ability  to conduct critical activities like distributions,  especially to the most vulnerable population  groups. The United Nations presence within the  Gaza Strip, including offices and storage facilities,  would be particularly impacted, including by  violence and looting. The loss of social cohesion  would involve the loss of most remaining socially- based coping, such as receiving food or cash  through social networks outside of immediate  family.Already strained, public order would collapse,  involving widespread and intense civil unrest,  including looting, riots, vigilantism, escalating  violence among various social groups, and  a wider breakdown of social cohesion.

Given the continued catastrophic food security situation across the entire Gaza Strip, a risk of Famine analysis was done for  Deir al Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah Governorates. This analysis considered whether Famine will occur under a reasonable  worst-case scenario during the projection period through 15 July 2024. An analysis for the northern governorates was not  performed as the FRC is projecting Famine in those areas under the most likely scenario. The FRC considered the assumptions for the worst-case scenario made by the Analysis Team regarding the evolution of the  conflict and the expected impacts on food security and acute malnutrition to be plausible for all three governorates.  The intensity of the conflict and the extent of humanitarian space will determine the magnitude and directions of population  movement within the Gaza Strip. It is currently impossible to ascertain the destination(s) of these human-made displacements,  however any further concentration of population in any already highly populated area, for instance as a consequence of  an escalation in the Rafah Governorate driving hundreds of thousands towards Al-Mawasi and the surrounding areas, will  significantly increase the risk of Famine. The FRC considered the risk of Famine statement made by the Analysis Team about Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah  Governorates to be plausible. Given the high degree of uncertainty and fluidity of the situation with displacements likely  forcing people to move to and from multiple localities, the FRC felt it was appropriate to group together all three of the  southern governates for a risk of Famine analysis rather than to separate the governates as different units of analysis.    Forced  displacement will increase the risk of Famine because of overcrowding, poor supply of food, water, and medicines, and limited  provision of health and wash services, which will expose the displaced population to epidemic outbreaks.  The FRC reached technical consensus that, under a reasonable worst-case scenario, there is a risk of Famine across the entire  middle and southern areas of the Gaza Strip during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July 2024. The cessation of  hostilities together with the restoration of humanitarian space to deliver multi-sectoral assistance and restore services are  essential steps in mitigating the risk of Famine.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF40 CONCLUSIONS OF THE FAMINE REVIEW COMMITTEE (FRC)  This report is the second time that the Famine Review Committee has reviewed analysis conducted by a multi-agency,  multi-sectoral Analysis Team to determine the current and projected food security situation in the Gaza Strip. The first  analysis, conducted in December 2023, determined that there was a risk of Famine within the projection period of  December 2023 to May 2024, and that the risk would increase for each day that the intense conflict and restricted  humanitarian access persisted or worsened.  The findings of the FRC’s latest review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza  Governorates  and is expected to become manifest between mid-March 2024 and May 2024. The Famine threshold for  acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that  it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward  trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.  It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major  acceleration of deaths and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible.  The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted  to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation  services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.  In the current period  (leading up to mid-March), the FRC finds the conclusions of the IPC Analysis Team for the northern  governorates to be plausible (IPC Phase 4 Emergency). However, the FRC highlighted that: (i) Famine thresholds for acute  food insecurity have already been surpassed; (ii) Famine thresholds for acute malnutrition (Extremely Critical) have likely  already been surpassed; (iii) It is likely that these extreme levels of malnutrition have not yet translated into a Crude  Death Rate above 2/10,000/day. The likelihood of having surpassed Under-Five Death Rate thresholds (4/10,000/day for  children) is higher but impossible to ascertain.  For the Governorates of Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis, and Rafah , the FRC considers the findings of the Analysis Team  for the current period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. The projection period identified by the Analysis Team  is mid-March 2024 to mid-July 2024. The FRC considers the most likely scenarios and conclusions of the Analysis Team  for the projected period (IPC Phase 4 – Emergency) to be plausible. However, given the high uncertainty over how the  situation will evolve and a high degree of fluidity given the intensity of the conflict, forced displacements, and constricted  humanitarian access in the next 4 months, the FRC recommends grouping all southern governates together for a risk of  Famine analysis . Thus, for the combined southern and middle governates, the FRC concludes that there is a risk of  Famine during the projection period of mid-March to mid-July  in a worst-case scenario with a reasonable chance of  occurring.  The primary drivers of the food security, nutrition, and mortality situation in Gaza Strip are the conflict intensity and highly  constrained/restricted access, defined as the ability of humanitarian and private actors to deliver the necessary supplies  and services to the most vulnerable population. Only an immediate and sustainable cessation of hostility, accompanied  by a sustained supply of food, water, medicines, protection services, and provision of health and sanitation services  to the population can reduce acute malnutrition and excess mortality. Provision of electricity/fuel supplies for water  trucking, pumps, health services, restoration of agricultural production, and other essential needs are also critical, along  with support for unrestricted civilian communications within and outside of the Gaza Strip. The actions needed to prevent Famine require an immediate political decision for a ceasefire together with a significant  and immediate increase in humanitarian and commercial access to the entire population of Gaza. If this does not happen  fully and immediately, even if Famine is avoided in the near term, the impact on mortality and the lives of Palestinians  now, and in future generations, will increase markedly with every day.<br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF41 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION Famine can be halted. The rapidly escalating hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip must immediately be curbed. This requires  putting an end to the hostilities, mobilizing necessary resources and ensuring the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance  to the people of Gaza.  Response Priorities  Overall recommendations • Restore humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip. • Stop the fast-paced deterioration of the food security, health and nutrition situation leading to excess mortality  through:  (i) the restoration of health, nutrition, and WASH services and the protection of civilians; and (ii) the provision of safe, nutritious, and sufficient food to all the population in need.  • The sustained supply of sufficient aid commodities, including but not limited to food, medicines, specialist nutrition  products, fuel, and other necessities should be allowed to enter and move throughout the entire Gaza Strip by road.  Traffic of commercial goods should also be fully resumed to meet the volume of commodities required.  Programmatic recommendations • Deliver acute malnutrition treatment services, specifically CMAM and IYCF-E services throughout the Gaza Strip, with  a particular emphasis on opening stabilization centres in the north. • Supply ready-to-use formula for non-breastfed infants and ensure sufficient access to safe drinking water if preparation  is required.  • Provide complimentary foods and micronutrient supplements for young children, as well as pregnant and lactating  women, the chronically ill, and the elderly. • Restore the functioning of market infrastructures and bakeries combined with cash-based interventions where  feasible. • Rehabilitate food production systems as soon as possible, including horticulture, livestock, and fishing. Situation Monitoring and Update  Considering the volatility of the context and the changing environment, the following risk factor elements should be  monitored continuously: • Intensity and extension of hostilities • Humanitarian access to supply food, water medicines, non-food items • Functionality and access to the health system and WASH supplies and services  • Entry of commodities though the Gaza Strip whether through commercial trucks or food assistance by truck or  airdrops • Population displacements and conditions in collective centres and scattered sites • Morbidity and disease outbreaks  • Acute malnutrition and mortality, with a distinction of the trauma and non-trauma causes <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF42 PROCESS AND METHODOLOGY Similar to the previous analysis conducted in December 2023, the IPC Global Partnership completed an IPC analysis for  the Gaza Strip to inform critical humanitarian information needs. Country led IPC analyses are the cornerstone of the  IPC process and will continue to be so. In the case of the Gaza Strip, with the onset of the conflict and the subsequent  humanitarian catastrophe, there was a critical need for an IPC analysis. Without an active country Technical Working  Group, the IPC Global Partnership made use of its non-TWG led analysis process to inform decision-making around the  crisis in the Gaza Strip.  The analysis was conducted remotely from 26 February to 1 March by over 40 experts from 18 agencies, applying standard  IPC protocols, and made use of publicly available data from a wide range of courses on the conditions in the Gaza Strip  (see below). Based on IPC protocols, the level of evidence of this analysis was assessed as “Medium” (level 2) for each of  the three units of analysis. At the analysis completion, the Famine Review Committee was activated to review the Analysis  Team’s findings. Their conclusions were adopted by the Analysis Team.

The IPC is a set of tools and procedures to  classify the severity and characteristics of  acute food and nutrition crises as well as  chronic food insecurity based on interna - tional standards. The IPC consists of four mu - tually reinforcing functions, each with a set  of specific protocols (tools and procedures).  The core IPC parameters include consen - sus building, convergence of evidence,  accountability, transparency and compa - rability. The IPC analysis aims at informing  emergency response as well as medium  and long-term food security policy and pro - gramming. For the IPC, acute food insecurity is defined  as any manifestation of food insecurity  found in a specified area at a specific point  in time of a severity that threatens lives or  livelihoods, or both, regardless of the causes,  context or duration. It is highly susceptible  to change and can occur and manifest in a  population within a short amount of time,  as a result of sudden changes or shocks that  negatively impact on the determinants of  food insecurity. Contact for further Information IPC Global Support Unit   www.ipcinfo.org IPC Special Briefs are produced by the IPC  global initiative and do not necessarily  reflect the views of stakeholders in the  Gaza Strip. Classification of food insecurity and  malnutrition was conducted using the  IPC protocols, which are developed and  implemented worldwide by the IPC Global  Partnership - Action Contre la Faim, CARE,  CILSS, EC-JRC, FAO, FEWS NET, Global Food  Security Cluster, Global Nutrition Cluster,  IFPRI, IGAD, Oxfam, SICA, SADC, Save the  Children, UNDP , UNICEF, WFP , WHO and the  World Bank. Phase 1 None/Minimal Households are able  to meet essential  food and non-food  needs without  engaging in atypical  and unsustainable  strategies to access  food and income.Phase 2 Stressed Households have  minimally adequate  food consumption  but are unable  to afford some  essential non-food  expenditures without  engaging in stress- coping strategies.Phase 3 Crisis Households either: • have food  consumption gaps  that are reflected by  high or above-usual  acute malnutrition; or • are marginally able  to meet minimum  food needs but  only by depleting  essential livelihood  assets or through  crisis-coping  strategies.Phase 4 Emergency Households either: • have large food  consumption gaps  that are reflected  in very high acute  malnutrition and  excess mortality; or • are able to  mitigate large  food consumption  gaps but only  by employing  emergency  livelihood strategies  and asset liquidationPhase 5 Catastrophe/  Famine Households  experience an  extreme lack of  food and/or cannot  meet other basic  needs even after  full employment of  coping strategies.  Starvation, death,  destitution and  extremely critical  acute malnutrition  levels are evident.  For Famine Classi  cation, area needs  to have extremely  critical levels of acute  malnutrition and  mortality.Acute Food Insecurity Phase name and descriptionLimitations of the Analysis  Given the major access constraints, data on food security outcomes  was collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI).  Quality concerns regarding the use of this methodology including the  representativeness, and potential biases associated with mobile network  coverage and ownership were discussed at length during the previous round  of IPC analysis (for data collected in November 2023). The Analysis Team  concluded that the data meets the requirements set by the IPC and were  the same for this analysis, especially considering the number of observations.  Through the efforts of partners, gaps in nutrition information were filled  through screening information. The high degree of volatility around the  conflict limits the ability to consider longer analysis periods. Scenarios on the  evolution of the conflict were developed in conjunction with conflict experts  to the best of their knowledge and expertise. <br/><br/>THE GAZA STRIP   |  IPC SPECIAL BRIEF44 ENDNOTES 1 PCBS Labour Force Survey, 2022 -

Only 63 completed questionnaires were recorded  in that survey round for Rafah governorate. Comparisons between the November-December 2023 survey round  and the December 2023-February 2024 survey round for Rafah governorate are only indicative given the non- representative sample from the first round. Additionally, the continued displacement recorded in the governorate of  Rafah after 5 December 2023 calls for additional caution when comparing Rafah governorate results across the two  survey rounds.</p></div>

   March 18 - the day of solidarity with political prisoners - in honor of the communist and revolutionary prisoners
  </strong>
</h3>
<p>
  March 18 is the international day of solidarity with political prisoners. Red help was founded by the Comintern in 1920, and declared in 1923 on March 18, the date of the founding of the parish municipality, as "the international day of solidarity with political prisoners" and devoted it to the political prisoners. On March 18, solidarity is expressed with political prisoners around the world.

   "The philosophers have only

   verden forskjellig; men det det kommer an på, er å
   <em>
    change
   </em>
<p p="">
<p>
     The reactionary Indian state has blocked over ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha, to prevent the war.
    </p>
<p>
     Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, even though he has sentenced his punishment. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by American imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed people from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons.
    </p>
<p>
     The fears of the ruling classes of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class hatred they feel against them are so great that they ruthlessly prevent the communists and revolutionaries they hold trapped in open violations of their own laws from leaving the prisons. The murder of chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the head of PCP, who lost health after 29 years in isolation and whose death was caused because the necessary health measures were not implemented, is very important to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred as the imperialists and the servile owners of The ruling system feels. Those responsible for chairman Gonzalo's death burned and even destroyed his body.
    </p>
<p>
     The communist and revolutionary prisoners in the prisons strive to meet the requirements of the Class Fight, with the risk of their own lives by challenging the boundaries of the conditions in the prisons. They refuse to capitulate and hesitate to resist all kinds of pressure, torture and isolation. We must mobilize to support the legitimate struggle and resistance of the prisoners, to fight against any form of aggression against the prisoners, in order to be the prisoners' voice outside the walls, we must support their struggle during the detention conditions as part of the class struggle.

<strong>
      The communist and revolutionary prisoners are our honor!

</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Supporting the communist and revolutionary prisoners means supporting the revolutionary struggle!
     </strong>
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
      Let's make the communist and revolutionary prisoners 'resistance and struggle for our own, let's be the prisoners' voice!
