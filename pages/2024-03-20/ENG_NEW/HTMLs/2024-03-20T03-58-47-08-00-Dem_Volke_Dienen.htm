  In Mexico, a wide and lively campaign is currently developing into a boycott of the upcoming presidential elections of the old Mexican state taking place on June 2nd.
  <a href="https://muralperiodico.wordpress.com/2024/03/13/mexico-avances-sobre-el-boicot-contra-la-farsa-electoral/">
   The comrades of the democratic and revolutionary website Mural Periodico write about the peculiarity of the Mexican election campaign in a report on the activities of the activities.

 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the election campaign, the election campaign as a central venue for contradictions and power is between the various political groups of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, comprador bourgeoisie and large landowners also lead to violence between these parliamentary groups. The comrades report this since the start of the pre-campaign on November 6th last year there were a total of 23 murder of politicians from the bureaucrat capitalist-large state. Another proof that the factions of the ruling classes and their political staff are only concerned with personal power for their own interests and the elections are not held in the least in the interests of the people in order to advance the country.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  Meanwhile, some powerful and combative actions against the election propaganda of the old Mexican state and the parties of the large bourgeoisie and large landowners took place as part of the election boycamping.
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Chiapas in the south of Mexico, an attack on a building of the electoral authority occurred on February 21. In the attack, the building was thrown at stones and Molotov cocktails, which led to a fire inside the building which partially burned and set furniture on fire. This led to a large -scale deployment of the state police and the national guard as well as the fire brigade.

 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  In Mexican state of Oaxaca, various propaganda actions against the elections took place on March 4 during a major mobilization with over a thousand participants. In this way, participants of the demonstration of the various parties remove and brought the walls to the boycott of the elections. The distant voting propaganda was then under the slogans "Elections are not the solution, the solution is the revolution!" And "does not vote, prepare for the fight".

  In the capital of the country, Mexico City, as part of the struggle for the tenth anniversary of 43 students, actions were carried out by police officers, in which the association of rural teachers and teaching students only expropriated a pick-up of the state electricity concentrate CFE And then with this pick-up, while severe fighting with the military and city police, broke a goal from the presidential palace.

 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  These powerful and brutal actions are not only an expression of the deep crisis in which bureaucratic capitalism and the old Mexican state are located, but also reflects the soul of the election boycott. The boycott of the elections refuses to legitimation to the old system and answers the question of how change can instead go to the fact that the popular masses, led by the revolutionaries, have to fight against the old system with revolutionary violence. This applies not only to the conditions in Mexico, but is a strategic question which applies to every country in the world, regardless of whether it is an oppressed nation or an imperialist nation.
