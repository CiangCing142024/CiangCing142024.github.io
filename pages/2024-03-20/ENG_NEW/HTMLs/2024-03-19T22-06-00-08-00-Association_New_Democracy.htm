 According to imperialist needs, it combines protectionism with “opening” of the 
 markets ("liberalism"), prices and subsidies, which becomes more strength from 
 The beginning of the 80s, it increases in the 90s and has great impulse in the 2000 and 
 2013 to “adapt” to the norms of the World Trade Organization (WTO 
 or WTO) and to the new international conditions of the dispute 
 Inter-imperialist. It is necessary, in relation to the above, to study better

    Problem is that, in many cases, the 
 classification or determination of the agricultural structure is done as if in the EU 
 27 There was a single economic world in agriculture, without differences from 
 development of capitalism, based on this, sometimes the 
 agrarian companies not for their investment and accumulation of capital, but for their 
 size measured in hectares. This leads to the true 
 agricultural producers, workers and small farmers, with the capitalists 
 that invest their capital in agriculture.
