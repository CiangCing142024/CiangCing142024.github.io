    The 
 German State is hitting the Turkish and Kurdish left structures 
 with even greater severity. Unfortunately, this is almost 
 unknown by the public. With an artificial accusation of terrorism (§ 
 129b), people are imprisoned over and over again, even if 
 They are not personally accused of a crime. The alleged 
 belonging to PKK (Kurdistan workers' party) or al 
 DHKP-C (Turkish revolutionary organization) is sufficient for 
 several years in prison, making Germany the tyrapy of 
 Erdogan.
