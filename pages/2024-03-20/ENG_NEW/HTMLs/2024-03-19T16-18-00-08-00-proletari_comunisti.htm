prevent his conference by accusing him of being complicit in the genocide 
Israeli on Gaza, in the Meloni government the voices of those who would like to

     Piantedosi
    </strong>
    In fact, he would have developed a plan that provides for "limited and 
 controlled "to the universities and to place the police at the entrance 
 of the classrooms where conferences and appointments are held to block the 
 disputes. The indiscretion follows the very hard statements of the 
 Minister of Agriculture, as well as brother -in -law of Giorgia Meloni, Francesco 
 Lollobrigida, which declared none other than a "excess of 
 tolerance »towards disputes could lead to risks 
 terrorist in the country.
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Do not take measures against episodes such as that of Naples,
    <strong>
     in fact he declared Lollobrigida,
    </strong>
    "in the past
    <strong>
     then led to terrorism
    </strong>
    and its reinforcement up to the episode of Aldo Moro, who, with his 
sacrifice, created such a broad democratic alarm that it allowed us to
 to defeat the brutal phenomenon of subversion." Nevertheless 
the juxtaposition of the events seems fanciful, to say the least, the Viminale 
He would already be running for cover. To trigger the concern of the

   In fact, they would be a series of meetings that should be held 
in Italian universities in the coming days and which could be 
strongly contested by the "pro-Palestine front" and against Israel. For 
That reason, according to the rumours made public by the
   <em>
    Corriere della Sera
   </em>
   , the government would be assumed more stringent security measures
   <strong>
    on classroom entrances
   </strong>
   where the meetings will have to be held, which from now on could 
 also be placed under the lens of the provincial committees for order e 
  public safety in the Prefecture, as well as the nonsense and of the 
 Relative technical tables. Given the non -predictable character of these types 
 of protests, then, could be
   <strong>
    surveillance before conferences increased
   </strong>
   , 
  hypothesis that heralds the presence of contingents of the forces 
 of the order to preside over the classrooms. For its part, the minister 
 of the Anna Maria Bernini University braked the hypothesis advanced by 
 Viminale, but he convened a meeting with the rectors for the next 
 Thursday, to agree with them the methods of repression of 
 protests.
   <p>
   </p>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">
    If the measures were to be put in place 
practice, we would be faced with yet another attempt at this 
government to trivialize protests and social demands. The 
"pro-Palestine front" thus becomes a label that transforms into a
    <strong>
     mere problem of public order
