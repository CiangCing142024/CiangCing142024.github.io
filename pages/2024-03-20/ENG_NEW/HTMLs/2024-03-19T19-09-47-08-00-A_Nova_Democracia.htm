  It will take place today, March 19, the judgment of the request for the defense of the popular activists for annulment of the processes. Motivated by the existence of evidence produced by an illegal infiltration, the appeal occurred after the first instance of the 23 political processes of the June 2013 days and the fight against the World Cup in 2014.
 </p>
 <p>
  Popular movements, class organizations and lawyers entities report that illegal evidence has not yet been taken from the process. As part of the complaint, a demonstration is being called at 13h in front of the trial, the Rio de Janeiro Court of Justice.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the calls for the demonstration, carried out by the Brazilian Center for Solidarity with the Peoples (Cebraspo) has a summary of what the process represents:
 </p>
 <p>
  “Absurdly convicted in the first instance to penalties that reach 7 years in closed regime, by an contaminated process of illegalities and that does not have any evidence against any of the processed, this process and its sentence is not only intended to criminalize the 23 activists but the right of manifestation and free organization. The Brazilian Center for Solidarity to Peoples calls all the democrats and entities in defense of the rights of the people to position themselves in defense of 23, and against the criminalization of the popular struggle. ”
 </p>
 <p>
  The hearing will take place in the e. Seventh Criminal Chamber - Music Alley 175 - Blade 4 - Room 205. It can also be accompanied through the
