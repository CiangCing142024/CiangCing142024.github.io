   Gadchiroli District, March 19, 2024:
  </strong>
  Four cadres of the CPI (Maoist), including Mangi-Indravelli Area Committee secretary Vargeesh from Telangana, were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in Kolamarka hillocks under Aheri tehsil of Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district early on Tuesday.
 </p>
 <p>
  Police had credible intelligence inputs that some members of the CPI (Maoist) Telangana State committee have crossed Pranahita river to carry out subversive activities ahead of the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, police sources revealed to the press today.
 </p>
 <p>
  Joint teams of local police and the Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF) Quick Action Team personnel launched a search operation in Kolamarka forest area late on Monday. One of the team members came under fire from the Maoists, leading to an exchange of fire in Kolamarka hillocks in the early hours of the day, police sources stated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gadchiroli SP Neelotpal told
  <i>
   The Hindu
  </i>
  : “In the early hours of Tuesday, our teams came under indiscriminate fire from cadres of the Maoist party while conducting a search operation in the Kolamarka mountains near Repanpalli, which promoted a response from our men.”
 </p>
 <p>
  The bodies of four Maoists were recovered and an AK-47, a carbine, two country-made pistols, Maoist literature, and other items were seized from the spot, the Gadchiroli SP commented.
 </p>
 <p>
  Police identified the slain Maoists as Divisional Committee Member Vargeesh, who is also secretary of Mangi-Indravelli Area Committee and Member of Kumram Bheem Asifabad-Mancherial Divisional Committee; Magtu, Secretary of Sirpur-Chennur Area Committee from Telangana; and Platoon members Kursang Raju and Kudimetta Venkatesh.
