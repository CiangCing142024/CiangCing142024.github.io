   The female movement today

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The female issue is closely linked to the form and the 
 Organization that human society must have in order to replace 
 oppression, deprivation, misery in all forms, with the 
 Human freedom, physical and social health. Is one side of 
  general social problem and will be resolved with him, that is by 
 overthrow of the exploitation system that gives birth to capitalism. 
 Actual equality of the woman and the man can be done 
 reality only when the capitalist exploitation of the 
 women and men, while managing the household, which today 
 is an individual employment, will be converted into a social field 
 production. As is wrong to hope and invest in equality 
 In capitalism, it is wrong to be considered to be by taking her 
 power from the proletariat is solved in an automatic way the female 
 inequality. The historical experience showed that it is not enough only to be defeated by 
 bourgeoisie and in terms of our country and imperialists 
 They "protect" her. It is required to deconstruct all the superstar which 
 has been shaped in the passage of thousands of years of class society, which has 
  takes various forms, but with always steady the inequality of 
 woman as a physical state of human species. The superstructure 
 penetrates on every side of life, in the customs and customs of centuries, into the 
 Language, art. Everything needs to turn around.
  </p>
  <p>
   Marxism has historically been identified with woman's conquests 
 and has shown the way to its liberation from every social 
 inequality. It was so decisive his role that is not bypassed 
 easily. Despite the systematic attempt of feminism to reset to him, 
 It shows incredible strength. But that's not enough. Historical Materialism does not 
 It carries eternal solutions. Is a tool of analysis of society and 
 revolutionary action. The answers and solutions given to others 
 Conditions a previous historical period, the conclusions of 
 Socialist construction is useful but they are not enough. They have changed 
 many data. Woman is no longer an integral part of the hard work 
 dynamic, while at the beginning of the 20th century he still claimed the right 
 at work. New forms of exploitation of the woman are added to the 
 Classic, new problems emerge through urban 'solutions', 
 New needs are created at the level of human relationships, new 
 Conditions of oppression are shaped within the modern family and by 
 Everywhere the violence of the system that targets it overflows. The process 
 Women's release is inseparable by class struggle and 
  economic, social, political and cultural changes that the 
 Revolutionary struggle brings to society.

    Woman and work
   </b>
  </p>
  <p>
   The woman always worked, and even hard, at home, in the field, 
  in the craft. Capitalism pulled the woman out of the house to 
 work on the big factories created during its period 
 industrial revolution. It was not the first time he participated in 
 productive work, but it was the first time you received and 
 She managed her own remuneration. Was so massive her entry into the 
 factories, which in 1820 75-80% of adult women in Europe 
 They worked in the fabric industry.
  </p>
  <p>
   Greece did not experience the industrial revolution as other countries 
 of Europe. Industrial Development progressed with very large 
 delay. Women started working in factories a few 
 decades after the creation of the Greek state. Until 1860 
 Few women worked in factories. Was so deeply rooted then 
  the view that work reduces the woman's morals and 
 removes from the family, which in 1877 was prosecuting intervention 
  Why the work in factories, due to the synchronization of men and 
 women, offends public ethics and comments on
   <i>
    'Ethics of the working class in Greece'
   </i>
   ! 
  Women and Girls Refugees who came from Crete after 
 Cretan Revolution (1866-69) and from Asia Minor in 1922, they found 
 work in factories. The 19th
   <sup>
    The
   </sup>
   century women and the 
 girls worked from the age of 5 years, mainly in occupations that 
  They did not require education as maids, land workers, washingers, 
 Modists, weavers, ribbons and hat. By the beginning of the 20th
   <sup>
    th
   </sup>
   century opened a window to work the educated women of 
  Meduses, as teachers at the beginning and then in various 
 Private and Public Sector Services. After the decade of 
 1970, women worked everywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today, in conditions of de -industrialization, shrinking of the farm 
 production and sovereignty of services, it is reasonable most 
 Women to work in the services. Although they are fired first, not 
 We can talk about a woman's return home, like 
 Some claim. Woman's work cannot be considered 
 Today's complementary man's work. Working women 
 remain an integral part of the workforce. Although it is 
  the most trained part of the population as they make up 60% of 
 recent graduates of both post -graduate vocational training, 
 as well as higher education, 39% of women aged 30-34 
 years old, they also declare that they are financially supported by the family 
 their. It proves once again that hunting of qualifications is 
 Deadly and lifelong education lifelong bonds. The financial problem 
 that drowns the people for women means trapping in 
 Wedding/Security. Work for many hours, do two and three 
 jobs, are permanently under pressure without free time. The salaries 
 hunger, endless working hours, overall working conditions 
 They influence the relationships and position of the woman within the family. 
 A woman pressed financially will think long before asking 
 divorce.
  </p>
  <p>
   A woman in her work has to deal with capitalist 
 Exploitation as well as her husband's colleague, discrimination against weight 
 of her sex and other forms of exploitation, such as sexual 
  harassment. When the law defines as a "patron" of working women 
  their employer, then urgent reconstruction of the female 
 movement. Powerful lights have fallen into the last issue, sexual 
 harassment, not to illuminate her but to darken the 
 other issues.
  </p>
  <p>
   There are thorns two issues: different earnings, gap, 
 As they say, between the salaries of men and women, which remains 
 Always for the same job, and motherhood. Pregnancy and the first 
 A child for a woman affect her relationship with her work. Against 
 rule keeps her away from her. 
 exploitation and oppression of women is not just a matter of speech or 
  Just a matter of resistance. Aimed to overturn and change whatever 
 It gives birth to exploitation.
  </p>
  <p>
   What is the race to grow? Through 'feminist 
  strike on March 8 »redefines the concepts of strike and 
  Work on a disorderly basis from 99%feminism. The 1% that 
 Missing are liberal women. We are all the rest. 
  A clever way to abolish classes is to make a 
 Great, which fits 99%.

   What is needed is actually a strike on March 8, dedicated 
 In the liberation of women and all the oppressed people from 
 their need and exploitation.

  Abuses, rape, murders of children and women in the 
 family or in the relative and friendly environment have become everyday 
 news. Mother killed her children, father raped his son or 
 his daughter, woman murdered by her partner, son hit her 
 His mother to death, 15 -year -old raped and tortured their classmate ...
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   No crime is the same as the other, each one is a tragedy 
 and all together show the moral downfall, relaxation or dissolution 
 of social bonds and the complete disintegration of society. Nevertheless, 
 Even these findings, no matter how correct they are, it matters 
 From which side does one see them. Everything around the crime, the 
 Ethics and consciousness of people are deeply class.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each historical period has its own characteristics, its own 
 crimes, her own code of ethics, her laws, the judges 
 and punishments. In capitalism, as in all class 
 Societies, what is a crime is determined by the ruling class. Crime 
 It is any action challenging its power or violates them 
 Its laws.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each crime is used by propaganda mechanisms in a way that serves the interests of the ruling class.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today's man is shaped in conditions of capitalist 
 imperialist barbarism. The financial crisis that was not overwhelmed, the 
  Memorandums that are in full power, the pandemic that does not say to 
 ended, the war in Ukraine raging, the threats of nuclear 
  Deadly hanging over humanity's heads, poverty 
 stretched out, the fascism that brings to the surface the most 
 harsh appearance of power, the Remules and the viciousness circulating in the 
  luxurious bourgeois lounges, revanchism and contempt for the people 
  which is stated in secret and everyday by all the factors of 
 System make the present very difficult and the future of disgust. Will not 
 Survival if you are not subordinate, they cynically tell the people those who have 
 secure in all possible ways to live many and well 
 years. Demonstrate their wealth, stressing that this society 
 It was made for the few.
  </p>
  <p>
   The man who cannot explain what is happening to him, who is 
 loaded with anxieties and immersed in poverty, he can't see 
 Nothing nice around him as he only thinks of his survival. When not 
  sees her through collective claim, thinks of individual solutions 
 to make money, since in capitalism everything is a commodity and 
 Money is the measure of the value of things and people. THE 
 How to deal with and sell things become a way of contact with 
  another man.
  </p>
  <p>
   In order to eliminate crimes must eliminate the causes that 
 They give birth, that is, the system of capitalist power. Those who 
 They fight for this purpose cannot treat abstract 
  inside. Of course, they cannot prevent society from defending it with 
 of her way against criminals, but therefore struggle more persistently 
 for the transformation of society from the foundations.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today's era is characterized by a dying of alienation, rushing 
 of fascist, racist and medieval ideas. The crime is 
 Characteristic of the system, its derivative, an example of its impasses. 
 When after each crime, except for the criminal, they attribute 
 Responsibilities in the family and school, they do it not because they challenge 
 these institutions, but to convey the responsibility to 
 people who should, always according to the bourgeois, to reproduce more 
 Faithful the ideal patterns they themselves define. Parents and teachers 
 must prove that they respond to their role, based on 
 Ideal model for family and school.
  </p>
  <p>
   The same causes that give birth to all crimes and the crimes 
  against women. They have, of course, their particular characteristics.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two people who are strangers among each other are in love with each other and there 
 who lived until yesterday's different life, now inquisitively dives into one in 
  another's life. The perception of the right to ownership is generalized. THE 
  A man considers his wife's estate. Also the perception of inequality 
 of the sexes plays a decisive role in human relationships in general, 
 Especially in gender relationships and especially in marriage. To some 
 societies the man has legally guaranteed his property on the 
 his wife. Until the 1980s, the man was recorded as the 
 leader of the family.
  </p>
  <p>
   Enriched the old ethics with its modern humiliation 
 Woman-Clastra, Beauty Beauty, Sexual 
 object in every advertisement, presents the woman as property of 
  every male. Thus the man will assassinate his wife or 
 his companion because he considers him his estate and why his selfishness does not 
 lets accept the rejection. An unknown will rape a girl and 
  The investigator will turn his offensive questions to her, to 
 find out if her appearance was the proper or if she caused the rape 
 Her behavior!
  </p>
  <p>
   The man bourgeois may officially have the right of the first 
 night that the feudal lord had but has the ability to buy or to 
 blackmail as many nights as the working class women want.
  </p>
  <p>
   The signs of the system are very easily distinguished on every victim of rape, beating or murder.

  The imperialists threaten peoples with general war.

   Before a war begins, governments attack rights 
  of their people. They are fond of him to fund their warfare 
 designs. Have to subdue him before they start war to subdue 
 Other peoples. Poverty, injustice and system violence are increased. THE 
 Woman understands, as she sees bread diminishing on the table, 
 feels the injustice and the violence break up on her, she sees what the people are going through

 Violation of social peace.

  <p>
   Lenin, addressing the international socialist conference 
 Women, with World War I raging, she argued that the 
 Movement of Women's Workers ''
   <i>
    can be the precursor of the general uprising of the masses
   </i>
   " 
  "The March of the Women of the People to Versailles" on October 5 
 1789, which began in protest for the high price and lack of 
  Bread, forced the king to give up his powers. It was 
 The first step of the French Revolution. The women's demonstration against 
 In the war and hunger, which took place on March 8, 1917, (23 February 
 with the old calendar) in Petersburg, led to the overthrow of 
 Tsar. This is how the February revolution began, which triggered the 
 October revolution.
  </p>
  <p>
   Today, we are not in a pre -revolutionary period. But the dynamics of 
 women when they go down the streets and especially when connected to 
  The labor movement should not be underestimated. The slogan 'peace and 
 Bread »will always express the female masses. Women of all peoples 
 of the world will unite in their struggle for a better life. Direct 
 anti -war duty to continue demonstrations to stop the 
 Genocide of the Palestinians.
