  In his speech, the new woman said: “The role of women has continued to date throughout history. Gender discrimination, pressure, and most importantly, we are experiencing double exploitation. In all previous societies, women lived as slaves. In today's world, women live as a slave in various ways, no matter where they live. In economic developed countries, they are in modern slaves. ”

  In the following: “Being a woman in the imperialist-capitalist system means being exposed to class, national and sexual exploitation and oppression, living in an inhuman way every day. While most women submit to this pressure unconsciously, there were also women who resisted this pressure. In our history, women's rebellion was tried to be prevented in the most ruthless ways, but in places where resistance was strong, women were able to achieve partial improvements about them. However, this is not the final salvation. " He said and said, “Socialist worldview and our leaders, Clara Zetkin and his comrades, women have shown that unless they are included in this struggle, the exploitation and oppression will not end and the system responsible for it will not change.” “We know how important the organized struggle is as immigrant and indigenous women in Germany. Because the imperialist capitalist system, which seems to be giant, covers paper in the face of our common struggle. We must be organized and act in an organized way. We must take a revolutionary stance together against all injustices and understand that there is no salvation alone. We must organize ourselves, because we can only destroy those who impose this life together. … We must organize, because we can only take care of our labor… We must organize, because we can only save other women… If we want to leave a free future for our children, we must organize… ”Speech” Long live International Solidarity! Long live March 8! " ended with the slogan.
