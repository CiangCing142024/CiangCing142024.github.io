Images: The political debate is used to political parties. On this basis, everyone (self) is determined. It is the only thing that was not done at the recent 4th SYRIZA-PS Congress! The reason is now outrageous: the "new party" that will emerge from the announced constituent conference (also called "re -establishment") in the coming autumn will not have (with the same or other name) not even a relation to what already exists.

  The political debate is used to political parties. On this basis, everyone (self) is determined. It is the only thing that was not done at the recent 4th SYRIZA-PS Congress! The reason is now outrageous: the "new party" that will emerge from the announced constituent conference (also called "re -establishment") in the coming autumn will not have (with the same or other name) not even a relation to what already exists. What is increasingly being excluded is openly promoting its bourgeois character and is focusing on the positions and practices that are cynical defamation and provocations towards the world of the left.

  So he fell in a conference with an indefinite number of delegates (!), With Kasselakis' personal Clacadors having understood the largest space (as reported by intra -party opponents), with no political debate, with 'decisions' New elections for the emergence of the president, but also with a hovering threat of new or new breakdown.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the political staff residing in the party of today's opposition, a political force of starvation, opportunism and anti -communism, has "succeeded". It reappears as a "united" and claims its election rise to the forthcoming European elections, with its chairman's bar being at least 17%, bringing back to our memory the well -known election target of the 10 -year reformist KKE in the 1980s, which had even been linked to the infamous "real change". Signs of the Times…
 </p>
 <p>
  The question is, of course, what all of them disagree with. In the big issues concerning our people and our country, they were united in the period of SYRIZA's rule, but also a "responsible opposition" in the first four years of Mitsotakis and continue to practice. What, for what is the interconnection? It is obvious that the second urban pillar and the political system has a serious problem due to the non -functioning of a classic bipartisanship in our country. We are therefore here, with the efforts to create and promote a systemic alternative management solution to lead the moves within SYRIZA. Something that "caught" the capitalist-imperialist system and, in the first post-transfer poll, shows him "catching up" or even surpassing PASOK! The agony of the centers inside and mainly outside the country is revealing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The handling of the foreground and the background at the aforementioned Congress-Parody were truly incredible. The "players" were changing a line at a dizzying speed, taking back even what they had just expanded. It is, after all, known to be the "flexibility" of this political space, which has been "a dissertation", since the time of the old KKE, adapting to the demands and winds that blow in the social system of dependence and exploitation. As for "direct democracy" Kasselakis, this is a great fraud, since all the data testifies to a highly leading party where social media is played by the key role, not some political-party processes. Some are talking about a party model of "Apollonian policy", as the current leader, from where elsewhere, from the US. You can discuss for hours and for days without saying anything!
 </p>
 <p>
  Tsipras's intervention shortly before the commencement of the conference, which monopolized its evolution, though it is evident from its outcome that it was a serious strangulation of his prestige, moves in the same direction as the current existential anxiety of this party. Tested in the difficult class for the ruling class by the pressure of the imperialist -lists and the massive kinetic presence -adhesion of the popular strata, he deposited his availability to "contribute" - even with him, in time, the way - to "overcoming" The problem of alternative urban management of the system and perhaps its party. The non -adoption of his proposal, however, shows that Kasselakis (despite his own ass) controls things. One, however, must be clear: there is no left -wing (FRO) fabric in the tricks and quotes. The increasingly right -wing political scene that has been shaping in recent years and in our country requires new right shifts than everyone. The era of "I take a flash left and turn right" can no longer be tolerated by the real holders of political power inside and outside the country. Only the path of adaptation remains to bourgeois politicians who hope to remain as a choice at least in reserve.
 </p>
 <p>
  The "clarifications" that the former prime minister has deliberately made to give at the "Kathimerini" conference leave no room for misinterpretation: If they and SYRIZA have a future, they should renounce the "sinful" past, to deposit the same as the "sinful" Where it must but also publicly and assure them in practice that there is no case of repetition. This did the conference itself and makes all today's political opposition political union.
 </p>
 <p>
  The proposal of a temporary way out of Famellou's re -exerted introversion, Pappas and G. Tsipras weighted a single factor, which is none other than the upcoming European elections. Whether or not the "knives" come back to or after them is open. Undoubtedly, however, the Polakis attack on A. Tsipras on "Meacoulpa" is based on the assessment that Tsipras "chapter" will currently remain in the back of the Astling and that the Kasselakis team will continue to control things. The Arivists, like his speech, always "bet" on the horse they thought would come first.
 </p>
 <p>
  And the members? These are "properly" for leadership when "pots" remain. To monitor those on the upper floors of their party and express themselves by giving (!) Subscribe to the leader. We give it a voice to the members and "Take SYRIZA in your hands" by the president sounds like a bad farce. Their loud detour even within the conference gives yet another awareness of what party they are.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the collapse of electoral -parliamentary delusions into a wide world of the left, this world is needed, with whatever left is left - because it has been a great deal of damage for decades now - to reinstall its presence in the movement that is necessary and may to exist. A movement of resistance and claim, in the prospect of a confrontation with the forces of the system. A movement that, in the furnace of the class struggle, will give all those materials that are essential to political subjects who want and can re -raise the issue of revolutionary perspective!
