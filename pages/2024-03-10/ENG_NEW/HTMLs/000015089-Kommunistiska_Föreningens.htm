    The editorial staff
   </em>
   has received a report on actions conducted during March 8, during the International Workers Woman's Day.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="color: #000000;">
   Among other things, there has been leaflet award on a March 8 demonstration, the following is the text from the flyer:
  </span>
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p style="text-align: right;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    <em>
     Proletarians in all countries unite!
    </em>
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    <strong>
     Live the International Worker Woman's Day!
    </strong>

   <span style="color: #000000;">
    “The women, like men, are reactionaries, centers or revolutionaries. As a consequence of this, they cannot fight the same battle together. In the current human panorama, the class separates the individual to more than gender. "
   </span>
   <br/>
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    - José Carlos Mariátegui, founder of Peru's Communist Party
   </span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    The struggle for women's rights in society has been long. But what women are the struggling women? What does class affiliation play for a role in the women's movement?
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    Feminism is in its essence a revolutionary idea, but the feminist movement is affected by two world views: a bourgeois and a proletarian. The bourgeois is selfish and struggles to preserve their privileges that only enjoy and can therefore give the appearance of working for more women to become venture capitalists or CEOs for companies, as they know that the majority of the world's women will never approach Such a position in the current system. They want us to believe in a false "female solidarity".
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    However, the proletarian truly revolutionary because it sees women's true potential as a leader. It is the struggling women out in the community that generate real leadership qualities. When the price of food, electricity and rent is raised at the same time as we are not replaced by the salary our work is worth, we cannot afford to be fooled by people who invest in war and who kill our innocent friends and friends around the world. Civil feminists such as Hillary Clinton and Ebba Busch are racist warriors who try to divide the proletariat from fighting together as they know we are more than them.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    Our oppression is of a double nature - we are oppressed both because of our class and our gender which is a motive for patriarchal structures. Women in third world oppression are of a triple nature - they are oppressed due to imperialism, their class affiliation and their gender because countries like the United States but also Sweden not only explore their own country's working class but also other countries' oppressed classes as workers and poverty farmers by buying up their bourgeoisie and invest in their state affairs.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    We understand that bourgeois feminists such as Hillary Clinton and Ebba Busch are reactionaries and imperialists, who together with their male colleagues Joe Biden and Ulf Kristersson defend Israel's "right" to "folk" because it benefits their class interests. They spread fake news about beheaded infants on October 7, 2023 and then kill 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza, but they also did not care about the real infants they kill. Nor did George Bush d.y. which motivated its oil war in Iraq with the words "respect for women can now become a reality in the Middle East".
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
   <span style="color: #000000;">
    Our proletarian analysis of the women's issue leads us to the conclusion that the patriarchal violence against the world's oppressed women is characterized by the main contradiction in the world, which today is between imperialism and the world's oppressed people. Therefore, we cannot put our fate in the hands of the imperialists. We have to fight together and organized under Maoism's red banner for ours, and our children's future, together!
