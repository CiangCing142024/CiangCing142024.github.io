  The Conference of the "New Left", the formation formed by MPs and executives who left SYRIZA after the election of St. Kasselakis in his leadership. With the central slogan of the Conference "Politics", the new party executives in their positions, and the decisions voted on, attempted to give the key features of the body, with many references to "Left 21

  century ”who want to represent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Of the placements of almost all executives who were ministers of the SYRIZA-ANEL government (not few), there was no critical reference to the government's "First Left" government. In the (Automatic) scams he cultivated, in the memorandum he voted for, in the anti-populist-assurance policy he implemented, to commit and submission to the US-NATO-EU. It is obvious that for the leadership and executives of this party, the history of the "political confrontation" within SYRIZA for its orientation begins in… 2019, when it loses the election and passes through the opposition. But even then, and despite his increasingly right shift to the "center -left" of government management, in the context of the system of exploitation, oppression and imperialist dependency, there was no substantial questioning, but only scattered criticisms. The dual elections of the summer of 2023 had to come and the SYRIZA electoral crash, which also brought the resignation of Tsipras to find out that they had to discuss its orientation. And they were these executives who are otherwise against the "leadership parties" who have nothing to do with the Left, who promoted the first election of a new leader in SYRIZA and after a conference of positions and self -criticism. It was only that they came to them ... Kasselakis and that their "leftism" could not stand it. A lot of hypocrisy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thus, they decided to "return to the roots" of SYN, which is also said by N. Filis, who also identified the ideological -political character, the vision of the new formation, saying: "It takes a spirit of democratic function and vision -and vision -and vision -and vision -and vision - This is socialism with freedom, democracy and respect for the environment. " To take the baton D. Vitsas and to raise the "bar" higher by saying: "Our ultimate goal is communism, it is not socialism with democracy and freedom. This is the intermediate goal. "
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the "socialist" and "communist" declarations of key executives of the "New Left", let's see the immediate action plan presented at the Conference by the President of the Parliamentary Group Al. Haritsis. With the common title "We are worth" the axes were mentioned for: "1. Life without precision, 2. state state ally of the citizen, 3. Economy for the benefit of many, 4. Substantial climate transition, 5. a society with a home for all, 6. a Greece of stability and peace, 7. A country with rights and rights democracy".
 </p>
 <p>
  The Conference also discussed the issues of "Foreign Policy", where the text in which the respective committee concluded: "In foreign policy, the defense of national sovereignty and sovereign rights of our country, respect for international law, Peace, stability and cooperation in our neighborhood are fundamental principles in the history of the Greek Left that inspire our present and future. From the recent past we keep the valuable legacy of the Prespa Agreement, which was a breakthrough in Greek foreign policy and one of the most emblematic acts of the SYRIZA governments. The "Spirit of Prespa" permeates all of our positions on foreign policy and we are self -criticizing the fact that we have not always adequately oppressed nationalist divergences. The "New Left" will go ahead with the principle that left and nationalism are not compromised. " And he goes on to say: "... it is steadily in favor of European integration and the active participation of Greece in it ... The" New Left "belongs to the forces of left -wing Europeanism. We are fighting for a radical shift in European integration ... We are opposed to steps that promote the EU's further submission to the US or even convert the Union into a NATO branch. "
 </p>
 <p>
  The "self-criticism" of the "New Left" leadership for the SYRIZA-ANEL governance has nothing to do with the fact that the US-NATO bases were developed across the country, it did not concern the formation of reactionary axes with Israel-Egypt, it had nothing to do with With the strengthening of NATO-EUs in the Western Balkans, the "Prespa Agreement was emblematic", but it had to do with the fact that they were not "adequately opposed nationalist divergences"!
 </p>
 <p>
  While the submission and reinforcement of the bonds of imperialist dependency is? Is it internationalism ...?
 </p>
 <p>
  And of course, no mention of exit from NATO and removing American bases from the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  We could say that based on all of the above we are facing a political formation that is not only "young". He carries all the "ancient rust" of a reformist current that constantly recycles and in "new" versions of his petty illusions. He wants "socialism" and "communism" without affecting any podium of capitalist-imperialist domination, without conflicts and reversals, a peaceful course of transforming the system through continuous transformations.
 </p>
 <p>
  We must admit that they are the most consistent devotees of the theory of "developing productive forces" that will "peel" the system to pop out socialism-communism in relation to its other "left" variants, which thrive in the KKE and the KKE. to organizations of the extra -parliamentary left.
 </p>
 <p>
  The main issue with this space is that it does not have the slightest reservation, when the system needs it, to become an organic part of the attack on the working people, it has proven it. At the same time, and in relation to the previous one, the services it offers to the system are multiple, provoking every concept of the Left, sowing confusion and trapping people into logic of subordination and defeat. And in this respect, such a political formation is quite useful for the local capitalist system, but also for the dominant imperialists, who not only contradicts but submits to them. Especially today that the rift that divides the system with the working people and the youth is constantly growing and expressing massively on the streets, as in the strike of 28
