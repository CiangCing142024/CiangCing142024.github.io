  The power of the struggle of the masses of farmers and student youth has undoubtedly put its stamp on the political and social developments of the last two months. And the meeting of this power - and even incomplete and incomplete - with the struggle of workers and social anger on the road, on the big and important strike on February 28, gave only a small sample of the possibilities produced by the co -struggling tracks. , from the direction of the resistance and claim front!
 </p>
 <p>
  It has been clear that the massive popular anger from the miserable social status, accuracy, expanding poverty and unemployment, the endless waves of the anti -populist and their consequences on the terms of work, studies, care and the life of the masses, will generate themselves. Constantly moods for struggle and struggle. That was what proved to be last year's magnificent mobilizations after the crime of the Tempe system, which was the fuse to break out the indignation that has accumulated "underground" for years. And as it turned out deafening from the recent events, the people and youth are anything but willing to forget and forgive about the real culprits of the crime. This is the case, even if their rage is diverted to the millions of online signatures for "lifting immunity" and "Constitutional Review", which, regardless of the intentions of the participants, only manage to disorient and obscure the way. of the struggle against countless crimes at the expense of the life system of exploitation and its policies. At the same time, the parliamentary process of the Inquiry Committee seems to be moving in the direction of full concealment, which recently appeared as a great success by the KKE, which had given the current struggle to adopt as a proposal by the bourgeois parties. , having previously taken care of the Sporting meeting to declare the end of mobilizations on the issue, in view of the "mother of battles", the parliamentary elections that were approaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, as real steps are not recorded, integration, upgrading of the struggle, the system forces will utilize the negative class-political correlation to promote their attack. It is this truth that is reflected in the ND government's determination to proceed with the Pierrakakis bill on private universities, not to retreat from the "sanctuaries and sacred" of "fiscal stability" in front of agricultural claims, while the fields were flooded again. And the compensation and projects that have been announced for months are referred to the calendars, to continue opening a number of fronts, such as the recent joint ministerial decision on the operation of afternoon surgery in hospitals and further commercialization of social good.
 </p>
 <p>
  The capacity of the government, of course, to implement its anti -populist agenda in all areas, as well as the support she still enjoys from the main centers of power inside and outside the country, is all but signaling some of her ability to convince her mattresses in order to accept its policy. That is why the government, as well as the "whole system", are constantly reminding that the attack will pass "by fire and iron", with an increasingly intensity of the fascism of public and political life, with persecution of fighters, with a drag. Courts' associations, with class union in illegality by the Hatzidakis-Georgiadis laws, with terrorism and targeting of the youth fighting, with Mitsotakis even making statements on the need to make changes to disciplinary rules of disciplines. The road to deleting students involved in the occupations is paved.

  <strong>
   Crisis phenomena in the urban political scene
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  With the headaches given to the government and the bourgeois political system, therefore, the popular mobilization and generalized rage, things are not easy for the regime forces, in conditions that have not yet been able to form an alternative, Urban governance and absorption of social vibrations. In view of the European elections, they are seriously calculating the distinction trends that are developing within the masses, with the possibility of the massive depreciation of the official political system and its parties.
 </p>
 <p>
  The recruitment of the threat of rising all right -wing forms, with messages from other EU countries ringing bells, in a framework of movement and capabilities, but very different for most of the bourgeoisie involved in relation to 'ourselves' ", As it is for example for the preference showing parts of French imperialist capital in Lepen, there is multiple readings: on the one hand, it reflects the existing concern of domestic bourgeois parties, and in particular of the ND, for a possible shift to far -right policies. at the expense of their own percentages and the extension of political instability. On the other hand, it expresses the conscious intention of the use of far-fascist forces as paths to react to social indignation, far from dangerous outlets for the system. What is certain, however, is that the "worries" do everything to continue to fuel the darker and darker structures with their politics, which is constantly shifting to the right. In this context, the newly emerged "Tona" center-back of Loverdos, which hastens to be useful in the reactionary processes of remodeling the political scene is also included.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this reactionary course, of course, SYRIZA takes a position, with the dissolution that was reflected in his recent conference to seal it. There, until the once "big political capital" Tsipras has come to be discredited, in the direction of a deeper systemic adjustment of the party undertaken by Kasselakis. The baton, of course, rushed to take Tsipras himself, with his posting at the Kathimerini Congress and "Mea Culpa" for the Novartis case and television licenses. Overall, the tendencies of renunciation in SYRIZA of any "spelling" of his rule are being strengthened, in coordinating with the rest of the bourgeois parties, with Tsipras and Pavlopoulos agreeing to the same conference that there was never a question of questioning the country's position in the country. Eurozone and the EU. Only some of the illusions of the extra-parliamentary left were finally left to glorify the tail policy in the "first time left" and the referendum, which is revealed again that it had another negotiating paper for the objective.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Kathimerini Conference "The Transition: 50 Years Later" was a first -class opportunity to proclaim their urban executives to commit to the '74 contract and the division of the dependency between the western patrons, which was the foundation of the bourgeoisie. A regime that has been built since then at the expense of the people and for the benefit of foreign patrons and local bastards. It was, at the same time, an attempt to set up a Siloam swimming pool for this local addicted bourgeois system and to repeat the well -known narratives of guilty of social conquests of the course that led to the crisis and subordinate to the memorandums. A doxology, also of "social peace" and a reminder, as characteristically expressed in Pavlopoulos's assumption of discussions within the Karamanlis government in December 2008 to lower the street and use "quasi -dictatorial media", about how hostile it is hostile. Over time, this system against the working class, the people and the youth.
 </p>
 <p>
  A system in a productive country, following a course of de -industrialization and annexification to imperialist monopolies all the last decades, with Mitsotakis challenging in Aspropyrgos for logistics centers in place of dissolved factories. In today's phase, in a country double -dependent, with US and EU imperialist bosses being "alleged" on the international vigorous competition and uncertainty as the US is moving towards their presidential elections in terms of intense infertility Until the fires on the fire raging in our neighborhood, focusing on the Zionist genocide that is taking place at the expense of the heroic Palestinian people with the backs of the local ruling class and its complicity, the geopolitical horizon and the darkness of the darkness. . Moreover, when it comes to upgrading its involvement in the unjust war in Ukraine every so often, with the surprise visit of Mitsotakis and the meeting with Zelenski, as well as with leaks immediately denied by a concession of Russian S-300s to the Ukrainian S-300. A move for which Russia has stated in advance that it will be considered "aggressive action". In a juncture, even after the successes of Russian imperialism on the field, discussions about all kinds of adventurous actions within the West, with Macron, are claiming a more expanded role in French imperialism in the gaps that are shaped by US policy. , to throw on the table until the immediate involvement with the troops and Putin to once again point the threat of nuclear devastation.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is not to be surprised that in this troubled and dangerous setting, with the local ruling class moving more and more "American -speaking", European imperialists feel the need to constantly remind that the country belongs to them as well. Thus, after the European Parliament's conviction, revelations about Anna-Michel Asimakopoulou's mass emails came to expatriates, while also demonstrating what the letter voting brings about even the perforated of their own processes.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The races can win!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the face of the sepsis and the stench that the urban political scene, the student movement and the struggle of the peasantry have been a ray of light, giving courage to the whole people. The strike on February 28 was an important moment, but it should not be treated as the "end" of mobilizations, as the forces of subordination and compromise would want to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing and political upgrading of the race is the main issue. Nothing has to wait for the poor peasantry from the meetings of the farmers with Mitsotakis. It must remain in the direction of the stupid struggle in the blocks. The students have nothing to wait for from returning their heads to the amphitheater, supposedly to fight "polymorphs", as the KKE is used to baptizing the closures of the struggles. They must insist on assemblies, occupations and demonstrations. Both sides have to seek steps and further steps, find their real allies in the working class and the working people.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the face of the adoption of the Pierrakakis bill, the political-historical experience of the movements that overturned voted laws must be exploited and transformed into a struggle force for today's conditions. In contrast to the revanchism of the regime forces, who are already trying to punish the youth for the struggle it gives with terrorism and intensification unprecedented. Against the deception of retreat of the dominant student left, who is preparing to recruit with the well -known loser slogan "to keep the law on paper". The student youth has proven in practice that it has a will for struggle and huge forces to implement it, even in the most negative conditions. This will must serve anyone who wishes to refer to the popular case. These forces must manifest itself on the road all the time, even more massively and decisively, until the victory and overthrow of the law!
