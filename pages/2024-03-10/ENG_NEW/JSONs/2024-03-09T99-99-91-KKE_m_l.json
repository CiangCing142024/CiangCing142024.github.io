Many thousands of workers, both from the public and private sector, despite the absence of a strike from the sold out of the GSEE, fought the strike at work and rushed to the streets, expressing their moods against the suffocation Everyday life they face, the result of the barbaric anti-labor-anti-government policy of the government and capital. The mass expression of the wrath and discontent of the world of work on the day of the strike has certainly been boosting from the mass and dynamic mobilizations that were underway all the time by students and farmers. At the same time, as it turned out in the last days before the strike, the one -year anniversary of the crime in Tempi and the climate of rage caused by the provocative operation of the responsibilities of the system and its managers played an important role in the massive strike. mobilization.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   ATHENA\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  It was filled with strikers and youth the center of Athens. The class course, the racing movements of teachers and students and the student resistance participated in the rally in Havtia, along with the collectives of the extra -parliamentary left and unions. Their blocks were particularly massively and pulsed to the Constitution, highlighting the need to defend labor and trade union rights and denouncing the crime in Tempi. The presence of the repressive forces, especially around the blocks of the hawks, was particularly challenging. The class march, before the strike, sought to highlight the need for it to be massed, with workplaces, discussions with workers, and with the central event he held in \"outside the walls\".\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Thessaloniki\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thousands of strikers in Thessaloniki, despite the crashing attitude of the EKT, which declared a 4 -hour work stoppage at the last minute. Against the trade union leadership, as well as employer terrorism, many workers have been covered by their sectoral associations. The class march and the racing moves participated in the rally in Kamara with massive and composed bloc. The attitude of the police here too. The class march participated in the morning in strike rallies, such as TELEPERFORMANCE, and in previous days intervened in workplaces.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   YANNENA\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Workers, students and farmers massed the strikes at the Center, despite the efforts of the trade union leadership to keep the workers' processes detached from the struggle of the city's student and agricultural movement. They were the blocks of class march and racing movements.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   PATRAS\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  One of the most strike rallies in recent years. The class march and the racing moves with distinct blocks started from the branch, along with unions, student clubs and labor collectives, and headed to the crowded Olga Square.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Chania\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Framed with a significant multitude of competitors was the block of resistance initiative that attempted to highlight the need to dynamize the resistance of workers, youth and the whole, of the people. There had been preceding interventions in the hospital and in workplaces, with a call to the strike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Heraklion\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite the strike attitude of the Heraklion Labor Center, the massive presence of workers in the strike was important, highlighting their racing moods. Massive and militant the block of class march in the demonstration. The previous day there was a wide intervention in Lionia Square, with banners and dudukas for propaganda strike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   blonde\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  There was a great deal of participation, especially by public sector workers, but also by students and students. The massive presence of youth is of particular importance, let alone in the current phase of turmoil and intense processes inside. The class course here too had a very massive presence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Corresponding images of mass strike mobilizations were recorded throughout the country. In Larissa, Trikala, Samos, Corinth, Volos, Alexandroupolis and elsewhere, the workers widely fought the strike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Mass participation is constantly looking for\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The strike of 28 February, therefore, is an important legacy and is added to the popular mobilizations of recent months. He captured the anger and indignation, but also the willingness to resist and claim in terms of mass movement, wide masses to the system's politics. Completing one year from Tempi, coupled with the relevant challenges and mockery of government staff and state mechanisms, reminded the complete depreciation of the people's lives and the murderous characteristics of the policy pursued by the system. People's discontent, however, is not limited to this mass crime. It is ruled in the overall barbaric policy that chases, flattens conquests and condemns the world of work in poverty and poverty daily. The \"connection\" of the issues was made by the tens of thousands of workers who participated in the strike, despite the - to a large extent - one -way and anniversary character that the dominant forces attempted to give it. And in any case the struggles of youth and farmers fueled the mass strike.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there remains the need for workers to come to the fore, by highlighting the labor claims. The boiling rage remains to seek a racing way out, both because it did not find it on the common front that was (and continues to be) necessary with youth and farmers, and because the problems continue to swell.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Accuracy has dissolved labor income. General inflation is maintained at 3.2%, in itself significant. For the popular strata, however, the situation is even worse, with food prices growing almost twice as high as the cost of housing has been launched. Real estate prices, which rose about 40% in 4 years, coupled with high mortgage interest rates, make a summer night dream market. At the same time, rents have increased even further in many areas, creating an unsolved problem for the majority of workers. To these comes to add the reduction to literally every aspect of social so -called benefits. The people are called upon to put their hand deeper into their pocket for care, for education of their children, for everything they need, and they are getting less, both at the level of benefits and financial support and in the level of access and quality of services.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Government policy causes and multiplies the problems, despite its provocative effort to present the opposite. They were sold through bids and possibly their actual values to have increased), they do not face the problem. After all, they recall that the political staff of the country, with the contribution of the media of the ruling class, has no contraction to fool the people overtly. Similar mockery is any moves on the issue of home. Subsidies concerning few and minimal or with conditions that ultimately exclude those in need, and \"tools for protecting the first residence\" that either do not apply in practice or end up in \"re -leasing\", ie the payment of rent for their own homes than those who are housed by those who do so. They lost them. And all of this is vigorously and \"solemnly\" advertised, \"forgetting\" that on the one hand they highlight the dire position in which the people are and on the other are only to be copied copies of benefits that have existed for years but were abolished (as they were for For example the programs of the old labor residence organization).\n </p>\n <p>\n  In the same spirit of presentation as a \"solution\" to a situation that simply baptizes the problem differently, government statements about acceleration by one month of raising the minimum wage are moving. Even if \"it will be ahead of 8\" (as Hatzidakis and Spanakis said), the essence remains that this minimum is very low, as is all the salaries that are not affected by its change. Three years on the bottom, for which the government has lifted a lot of dust in the past, they still \"extinguish\" the 12 -year service, but their \"ceiling\" ends at a very three -year period by 2027, as the general rule For freezing as long as unemployment is more than 10%, it remains in force from 1/1/2027 and the revision of the unemployment rates initially announced by ELSTAT also led the official index to a double -digit rate. And the \"promises\" of doubling the average salary are completely in the air.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The only honest position on the part of the system is the one that says that \"whoever does not go out, to get (and another) work\". And they are common to private employees, civil servants, farmers, pensioners, students, students. The system does not recognize any people's right to a decent life. He is not even committed to ensuring his life. In fact, the people and the workers are struggling to survive in an ever -increasing regime, which government policy makes even worse. , while the future is much more gloomy as the confrontation not only continues but rises levels. In such a context, even this government's \"encouragement\" is in the air, as the possibility of finding any jobs to be looking for is increasingly likely. And it is certain that government policy will continue to dismantle any protection grid.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Against undermining the labor matches must be formed\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The only real way out for workers is the collective struggle for resistance to anti -labor policy and claiming their rights. With the preceding struggle for real salaries to cover the cost of life. For collective agreements that will guarantee increases for all workers and improve the terms of work. For a real increase in unemployment benefit and for the entire unemployment period. For work and life with rights. A struggle that first requires the emergence of labor claims and escalating mobilizations. Against the moods of trade unions, which prove that they are moving in the opposite direction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the one hand, GSEE did not even get a strike. He also complements a year that he has not made the slightest decision on strike: neither the law of Georgiades, nor against the anti -populist budget, nor for wages and precision, nor for care and social security, nor for education, nor\u2026 He has opened openly, on the side of the system, the role of burning any racing mood, cultivation of frustration and defeat, preventing any efforts to set up labor struggles. And it perceives very well the criticality of this role as indignation accumulates, deadlocks grow, government propaganda is revealed, the illusions of \"different\" management of the exploitation system collapses. Her decision - at the end of January - for a strike on April 17, is part of the demands of the role, which is not simple, as her \"detour\" cases certainly concern her effectiveness to keep workers on the sidelines. In the hope, possibly in consultation with the government, that the increase in the minimum earlier will work undermined, it is certain that it will do everything it can so that even this strike that has called on it to be limited and controlled.\n </p>\n <p>\n  On the other hand, PAME and the rest of the forces that - also in the late January - put the direction for a strike on February 28, did what they were going through to keep employees from meeting with student and agricultural mobilizations. In the phase of their development. And, even more so, the labor claims are not highlighted and not to join a common racing front against anti -populist politics. The call for 28/2, without any other, objectively put labor issues in a second plan, a direction that was reinforced by the absence of substantive processes in the unions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Despite the moods of the sovereign forces, the problems faced by workers are here, they are daily and leading to even worse direction as government policy progresses and employer arbitrariness does not encounter mass resistance. And neither the government fairy tales nor the next ballot boxes can \"wait\". They require work to highlight the needs and rights of workers, against the \"boundaries\" of the system. They require the formation of resistance and mass struggles, against the obstacles that the system puts. This necessity was attempted to serve the proposal of the class march, January, for labor mobilization from the beginning of February, but met by forces referring to the labor movement a combination of defeat, weakness and illusion about the role of trade unions. And especially PAME. The necessity remains, the strike on 28 February confirmed that the world of work is looking for it. A key task is to strengthen, at all levels, of labor resistance that regularly erupts and emphasizes the need and ability to activate the endless popular forces.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.kkeml.gr/ps958/oi-mazikes-apergiakes-kinhtopoihseis-stis-28-flevarh-anadeiknuoun-dunatothtes-kai-kathhkonta/", "type": "article", "title": "Mass strike mobilizations on 28 February highlight capabilities and duties - KKE (M -L)", "description": "The strike of 28 February, therefore, is an important legacy and is added to the popular mobilizations of recent months.
