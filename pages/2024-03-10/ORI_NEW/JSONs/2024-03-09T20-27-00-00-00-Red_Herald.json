In a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, where women are forced to live in this chamber of \nhorrors then what is the value of constitution and fundamental rights. Women face multitudes of \neconomic and extra economic exploitations which goes unpunished and male domination barricades it \nfrom the general sight of society. Whether it is the war-torn regions of West Asia, Palestine or in Ukraine \nor, whether it is in the garment factories of Dhaka, the valley of Manipur or the forest belts of central \nIndia, women everywhere is facing the burn of imperialist crises. In India, the condition of women i s not \nsublime as propagated by the BJP fascist Narendra Modi.  Brahmanical Hindutva Fascism with the \nsupport of Imperialism provides impetus strength to one of the most inhuman form of social hierarchical \nsystem that transforms women into an object of 'pleasure' and exploitation.   \nFinance capital for its valorization requires a unified market, cheap source of labor power and abundant \nnatural resources. Women oppression in the age of moribund Capitalism is interrelated with finance \ncapital autocracy. Unable to see this attached strings, will be like punching in the dark. There is no doubt \nthat Capitalism in its free-trade; manufacturing period brought significant number of women from the \ndark dungeons of household to factories. Due to this unprecedented expansion of social production, \nworking class women movements came on the scene that gave birth to subjectivity of women's rights \nmovements. Capitalism wherever it got upper  did away with some feudal patriarchal values but \nCapitalism gave birth to new form of patriarchal values that devalue the labour of women. Bourgeois \ndemocracy that is based on glaring social and economic inequalities have failed to give complete \nequality to women (the half of the human race) and to men. Bourgeois republic only in words it \npromises equality to women but it in reality sustains the oppressive patriarchy system that looks down \non women. Capitalist society turns every object into commodity and women are not an exception and \nactually she faces it many forms. Bourgeois deceitful phrases consoles women only in her imagination \nbut in reality those phrases denies the existence of Individuality to women which leads absence of \ndemocratic rights. In Manuvadi system woman is considered not as a free being. Right from birth to \ndeath she must be under the domination of male. Right to own productive forces especially land and \nright over reproduction sphere has been denied by the ruling classes in India.  \nPro-Imperialist and Feudal Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeois policies of the BJP government have \nbroken the back of women dignity and her democratic rights. Displacement due to corporate-driven \ndevelopment model has taken away all necessities of life from the marginalized classes. Women and \nchildren particularly from the tribal communities who come under the PVTG are the worst sufferer of \nthe problem of displacement in India. Casualization and contarctualization of the labor force in Indi a \nproves to be an efficient means for the extraction of profits by Imperialist and CBB led development \nmodel of the Indian state. This led to the in-formalization of the workforce in the unorganized sector \nthat is significantly composed by cheap women workforce. Concentration and centralization of capital in \nthe era of Imperialism has crossed the red marks. This again has brought havoc on the normal life of  the \n\n\noppressed people especially of women.  Lakhs of small scale industries were force to shut down during \nthe 10 years of Modi-kaal. Consequence of it was the significant rise in the army of reserve labour.  It  \nwas woman who has to carry the burden of unemployment under her head as majority of workforce in \nsmall scale industries are composed of women sex. As the source of income became miniscule due to \napathetic economic condition, percentage of women trafficking and prostitution has raised its ugly head  \nafter the horrific lock down. All these factors are leading towards feminization of rural work force that \nreinforces Brahmanical patriarchy with more intensity.  \nSexual exploitation and economic exploitation of women goes hand in hand,  due to social ills they are \ninseparable. At present most of the cheap agricultural labor is carried by women and at the same time \nthey face sexual exploitation by landlords and moneylenders.According to the World Bank Labor Force \nparticipation Report (2022), only 24 percent of women in India are gainfully employed. Retrenchments \nof workforce from IT companies have become the norm in the time when capitalism is going through \ngeneral crisis. Most of the retrenched employees in IT sectors are women employees. Even the wisdom \nof the IT giants that is based on finance capital is not free from patriarchy. This rightly proves that \nhegemony of capital in social production and the presence private ownership of production forces will \ncontinue the patriarchal domination in society. As per as Global Gender Gap parity report 2023, Indi a \nstands at 127th position out of 146 countries in gender parity index. There is no question of women \nempowerment until the country remains in the shackles of Imperialism. Economic crises intensify the \npatriarchal violence in society and it is established by the fact that more than 4 lakh cases relating \ndomestic violence is hanging in the courts. Today, illiteracy is highest among the women in India. Out of \nevery 100 women, we can find more than 30 illiterate women. Due to commodification of education \nthat serves the education corporate giants, schooling right from elementary to higher studies are \nbecoming out of reach for the downdrotten classes.The drop out rate from schools and colleges is also \nhighest among the women. All these are the effects of Pro-Imperialist and CBB policies of the BJP regime.  \nAs the General election of 2024 is itching closer, the ruling classes political parties has not left any stone  \nunturned to cajole the masses for its electoral benefits that remains in the service of CBB and \nImperialism. At this time it is the RSS- BJP which has taken the central stage for advertising its facade \npro-women stand. RSS-BJP is extremely busy in propagating the so- called women empowerment \npolicies (Nari Shakti Vandana) of Narendra Modi's government. Nothing can be more hilarious than to \nhear from the mouth of fascist about gender justice and women empowerment. Echoes of applause and \nreverence are being showered by liberal feminists on Narendra Modi for his outstanding effort to pass \nthe women reservation bill from the house that was stuck-up for more than 27 years and for blocking \nthe bill for long 27 years BJP-RSS had played prominent role. Lot of dust has already gathered over the \nwomen's reservation bill as it has taken long 27 years to arrive at the present point. Still taking such a \nlong protracted journey, it has finally turned into ineffective and contemptuous towards women gender. \nTo include delimitation and census clause in the bill itself proclaims that BJP has no real interest in the \nbill. The act will come into effect \"after an exercise of delimitation is undertaken for this purpose after \nthe relevant figures for the first census taken after commencement of the Constitution (128 amendment) \nact have been published...\"  The BJP government has not conducted 2021 census on many pretexts. The \ngovernment is running without the knowledge of the facts about the socio-economic condition of \n\n\npeople. All its programs are nothing but talk in air; hence it carries not a single grain of truth but \nfallacious propaganda. \n  It is been projected by the liberal feminists and RSS- BJP clans that this bill aspi res to bring more \nwomen in the upper echelons of power that will promulgate pro-women policies and a gender just \nsociety. This is the ruling classes and fascist's treacherous design to cook consent for continuation of its \nhegemonic and coercive dominance over the masses. In socially and economically backward country like \nIndia, working class women, peasantry women and women from oppressed castes and communities are \nthe most exploited being in society. Both economic and social exploitation remains an integral part of \nwomen in India. Such exploitation of women is carried out under the guise of democracy and women \nempowerment. Imperialist- finance capitalism has kept our country in shackles that has denied all forms \nof development.  \nThe Indian ruling classes in alliance with Imperialism has negated the democratic revolution that \nremains a necessary precondition to break the glass ceilings of patriarchy.  As the entire Godi Media was \nmasquerading about women's reservation act in its prime time show, a Dalit woman was stripped in \npublic and then urinated by the upper caste just because she was unable to pay 1200 rupees of loan. \nNeither President of India who happens to be woman nor any other political parties has been \ncondemned the incident. But, India was celebrating pompously the women reservation act.  \nWomen are visible in every struggle, whether in the Aganwadi, whether in Kashmir, Manipur against \nterrorist Hindutva forces violence supported by Indian state, whether tribal women who are fighting \nagainst the corporatization and militarization in the central Indian forests areas, against CAA-NRC, in \nfarmers protests, in struggle against Hindutva fascism, in struggle against Imperialism, women are inner \nshell of all these democratic movements. All these movements are by women from various spheres of \nlife are part and parcel of women empowerment. These are all class-struggles and without class-\nstruggles against feudalism, Comprador Bureaucratic Bourgeois and Imperialism there can be no \nquestion of women empowerment. Real democratization of Indian society is only possible when the \nbase for semi-feudal and semi-colonial exploitation is rooted out forever.  To accomplish this task \"Every \ncook must become politician. Only then can social revolution be victorious.\" \nDear sisters and Comrades,  \nSince last four decades, Dandakryan women are fighting against loot and plunder of natural resources by \nthe corporate classes. They have resisted white terror fascist Salwa Judum Campaign, Operation Green- \nHunt, Operation Samadhan and now they are bravely putting up a fight against newly launched \nOperation Kagaar (Final War). The Indian ruling classes with the support of imperialist masters have \ndeployed thousands military forces in the Jungles, along with war tanks, military drones, choppers and \nother war mechanisms. All these are because the grass- root tribal politically consolidated women is \nstriving for their rights over their forests. They are fighting against the fascist Indian Brahmanical State \nfor a just and equal society. They are in all productive works and are the blood- line of revolutionary  \nalternative people's political power organs. They are breaking the chains of patriarchy with new \ndemocratic cultural practices. Women's movement of Dandakaryana is creating a new chapter in the \n\n\nrevolutionary history of human species. It is a source of inspiration for the downtrodden class and \noppressed masses. For that reason, the Indian ruling classes are desperate to crush the revolutionary \nwomen's movement in Dandakaryana with iron heels. It is imperative to protect and strengthen the \nDandakaryana women's movement in order to nail the coffin of Hindutva Fascism.  \nRela Madkam, \n Adivasi Women's Organization (Bastar).
