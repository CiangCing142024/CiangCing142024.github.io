   <b>
    Javier Milei's regime has undergone a considerable defeat 
 before ending the two months of mandate
   </b>
   . His most precious project is 
  go back to the congress.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Of
  <em>
   <strong>
    Daniel Campione
   </strong>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  Faced with the prospect of exit loser in the vote of 
 most articles, the blocking of the deputies of La Libertà advances 
 (LLA) Together with some directors of the president they decided to 
 Send the project called "Omnibus Law" again to Commission. 
 A declaration of impotence, since according to the regulation of the 
 Chamber of Deputies, the return to the Commission implies the return to 
 zero, as if nothing had been discussed or approved in place 
 legislative.
 </p>
 <p>
  The frustration of the government not only has not led to gestures of 
 self -criticism or conciliation, but immediately gave the voices free 
  of resentment and threat. To begin with that of the same 
 president, who thundered in the X network, shortly after he had known himself 
  the parliamentary francasso: “The caste has been against the change 
 that we Argentines have voted in the polls ". And added 
 “We will continue with our program with or without the support of the 
 political management that destroyed our country ".
 </p>
 <p>
  There were those who reminded the first agent who 
 The integration of parliament is also legitimized by suffrage 
 popular. And that the LLA has a set of legislators so reduced
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 Why 
 In the general elections it obtained 30% of the suffrages, not 56% of the 
 comparison of everything or nothing of the second round.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  And the question that falls appropriately remains: which means to continue 
  without the support of political management? It is possible that you think of 
  establish a fate of civil dictatorship in which power 
 executive face and dysfi. For the moment we already speak that the president e 
  his sister, both today in Israel, would be willing to invoke one 
  non -binding popular consultation to try to avoid the 
 parliament.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some official tweets of the government party were still 
 worst: “Betrayal is paid dear and freedom will do not allow 
  that governors damage the people to maintain their own 
 privileges. The Basic Law returns to the Commission ".
 </p>
 <p>
  This tone of moral superiority and offended dignity cannot bring 
 very far away "The forces of the sky". Have promoted a project of 
 manifest unconstitutionality, which aspires to a reformulation of the 
 Argentine company. The whole of his text of the law implies 
 an aggression to popular interests and gives white paper to the great ones 
 cheap groups do their business as they condemn the 
 majority to poverty, eminus, hunger.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this "program" they could not even agree 
 With most of those who were widely willing to "collaborate", 
  like the legislators (right) of the radical civic union and those of the 
  New block "Let's do federal coalition". And emerge from this 
 situation with a growing clash with legislative power. And with i 
 Provincial governors, including those who come together for 
 the gearbox (right), since they have been accused and threatened 
 indiscriminately the provincial agents.
 </p>
 <p>
  The government has not helped the government given by a whole one 
 Fan of "security" forces that day after day in Buenos Aires 
 He triggered the repression against demonstrators in Plaza Congreso. That 
 they were nothing else that women and men tired of seeing worsening the 
 their own living conditions and trampling on their rights. And react 
 with fright and anger against a rule that heralds abuse a lot 
 worse.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   On the wet ... now the decree
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  To complete an unfortunate day for the current managers of the 
 "Public thing", a federal judge issued a request for 
 direct information to the Ministry of Security, with a term of 72 
 hours to respond, on the elaboration and application of the protocol that 
  He wants to suppress public events.
 </p>
 <p>
  This measure could lead to a declaration of 
 unconstitutionality of the repressive tool designed and applied by 
 Minister Patricia Bullich. The same that will continue to be 
 fought in the streets, as it almost has already happened since the same day 
 in which it was issued.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tuesday the LLA government experienced an important slide and 
  even a part of those who can e 
 They want to be his allies, as we have already exposed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In any case, we must not be fooled. The defeat is not total 
 nor definitive. The furious adjustment that promotes the minister 
 of the economy Luis Caputo continues its course, as Tuesday has it 
 The same immense increase in public transport was demonstrated. At the 
 at the same time the DNU 70/23 continues to stand, which contains it 
 time a “
  <em>
   empowerment
  </em>
  ”Of the great capital in each of his 
 clauses. In which, among many other provisions, it changes in 
 a regressive sense most of the labor law and get rid of 
 Any restriction every type of contracts. The law of the strongest.
 </p>
 <p>
  Without a doubt now the popular struggle and critical points of view 
 they will go against this rule, which will be in force until you 
 will reach the parliamentary rejection or, the thing that is more likely, 
 is declared unconstitutional.
 </p>
 <p>
  The organizations that are mobilized in the protest is unlikely that 
 wait for one or the other. They will continue to stay in the public space, 
 they will persist in the request to the CGT to launch a struggle plan, yes 
  They will unite new organizations and thousands of will to occupy squares 
  And roads making their right requests feel. By trade union groups 
  combatives to social movements and left parties, passing through the 
 associations of pensioners and the reborn popular assemblies, not 
 they will back into their commitment.
 </p>
 <p>
  ***
 </p>
 <p>
  The government is hit, its "star project" bite the dust 
 After long days of discussion and dozens of injuries after it is 
 His discussion began. The messianic gaze that characterizes it 
  He will lead him with certainty to be a bad loser. It's a lot 
 probable that you try to double the bet, that it makes a 
 Even more bitter adjustment. And that you try to attribute “powers 
 extraordinary ”, without the consent of anyone else than his supporters 
 more fervent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Real democracy, social conquests, level of life, yes 
 they will defend on the street. Also there it will be necessary to make the struggle so that the 
 freedom do not continue to be thrown into the mud by those who believe 
 that the only subjects who deserve it are large companies. AND 
 so that the "... everyone goes away ..." recover his original meaning, later 
  his absurd appropriation by those who go against the 
 people who rebelled in 2001.
