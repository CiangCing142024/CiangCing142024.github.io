  The unthinkable slave revolt

   Those who say that Israel was aware of the plans of 7 
 October are reconfirming an old colonial common place according to 
  to which the natives are too docile, too submissive, too cowardly and 
 Too inferior to rebel against their oppressors.

  Zubayr Alikhan - February 8, 2024
 </p>
 <p>
  On 7 October 2023 the Palestinians launched the largest 
 Decolonial operation in the history of Palestine. They saw the 
 their chains, they demolished the cage and sautéed the walls of 
  iron. The Palestinians took flight. They blinded the cameras, 
  Communications and penetrated the settlements interrupted. They have 
 paralyzed a colony of nuclear colonists and have brought to their knees 
 The Empire. They cut the umbilical cord of inexpression, of the 
  safety and sacrosanct domain, vital for all projects 
 colonial.
 </p>
 <p>
  Immediately, imperial scribes and politicians, settlers and administrators 
 colonial, conservative and liberal - especially liberals - are 
 put at work. Their task was twofold: to ensure that the world 
 saw natives as wild hordes, barbarians, animals, quintessence 
 del evil - Here the liberals quickly forgot theirs 
 political correctness and havetened to condemn - and 
 at the same time restore the domain.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first stormed the world, but for anyone who was healthy to 
 mind has always been fallacious and now it has been tirelessly and 
 completely dispelled. The second, however, has permeated the mind of 
 Many, even those potentially well intentioned. This 
 restoration of the empire has manifested themselves in several ways: the Palestinians 
 they could not have escaped alone, they would not have been able to penetrate 
  there
  <span>
  </span>
  Iron dome, Israeli security systems are too much 
 advanced to be overcome or unarmed - Israel “has let it 
 they did. "
 </p>
 <p>
  Without losing a blow, an unprecedented operation that shattered the concept of imperial invincibility
  <em>
   has been reformulated as an imperial tool
  </em>
  . 
  It was part of a plan

 wider general to strengthen and expand 
  further the domain: the natives were senseless pawns 
 provision of an omniscient colonial power and intellectually 
 supreme. From this vein of thought - and in it - many emerged 
 Other truths, half truths and lies that highlight and consolidate it 
 the socket. According to some, Israel had actually supported and created 
 Hamas. Netanyahu had planned all this to win the next 
 Elections, support others. And my favorite - especially because it is now 
  been enriched by the Zionist stenographers of
 <em>
  New York Times
 </em>
 - "Israel had always knew."
 <span>
 </span>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Surely, the next discovery will be that Israel knew of the flood 
  of Al-Aqsa before the Palestinians themselves, who invented it, has it 
 Presented in Hamas and inculcated it in the minds of the Palestinians. At the 
 basis of all this - and to constitute the raison d'etre collective 
 These theories - there is the unthinkability of the slave revolt (or gods 
 natives).
 </p>
 <span id="more-26848">
 </span>
 <p>
  The unthinkability of the slave revolt is a concept introduced 
 by Michel-Rolph Trouillot to explain the answers, silences and the 
 silence of the western empire on the Haitian revolution. While 
 Trouillot uses it in relation to the 18th century imperialists, this 
  unthinkability is applied without interruption to the present: 
 the empire, its ideologies, its colonialism, its genocides and the 
 His colonies are not stories to study, but material realities and violence 
 lived. Today.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the outbreak of the Haitian revolution, the most common reaction in 
 France, England, Spain and the United States was disbelief. The news 
 It was false. The facts-just like those of the Al-Aqsa flood- 
 They were too improbable. In any case, the facts had to be false, 
 Because blacks, like the Palestinians, were beasts without brain, wild 
  forced to docility, lazy, disorganized and lower: they were 
 absolutely unable to devise such an operation, much less than 
  organize and make it.

    This 
  title page of the novel of 1802, "'' Incandie du cap, ou le règne de 
 Toussaint-Louverture ”of the French novelist René Périn, has become 
 one of the most recognizable representations of the Haitian revolution, 
  used as a propaganda that delegated the revolution and attacked 
  His leader, Toussaint Louverture, which Périn described as a "Negro 
  atrocious ”of which he wanted to“ offer a portrait on which, reader, 
 You may be forced to pay many tears !!! " Illustration 
 It depicts a well-dressed toussoint-eLuverture that presides over the ruthless 
  massacre of innocent whites, many of which are women and children. [On 
 This epic revolt was written a great book: the black Jacobins. The first revolt against the white man, of C.L.R. James]

 <p>
  Even if the rebels had somehow evoked the spirits and 
 completed miracles, intellectual, military, economic superiority and 
 Razziale dei Bianchi assured that they would be quickly tamed, 
 chained and put again at work. The problem, however, was 
 just that the West was reacting - to the fact that occurred - and 
 devising explanations, while the blacks and the Palestinians implemented 
  the unthinkable, actively neutralize the colonial forces and 
 claimed the lands.
 </p>
 <p>
  Slowly and reluctantly, the reality of the operations made its way. 
  The news of ruthless black hordes that massacred the whites reached 
 Europe, and the Zionists proclaimed the "horrors of San 
 Domingo ". The news therefore had to be rationalized in one way 
 Different: the obvious facts were, they are still unthinkable. Therefore, the 
 revolution was “an unfortunate repercussion of the calculation errors of the 
  farmers ", the flood of Al-Aqsa was the result of" A waterfall of 
  False years duration of years ”of Israel,“ did not aim at a change 
 revolutionary ”, did not aim at decolonization,“ it was not 
 supported by the majority of the slave population ”, was Hamas 
 who acted alone and the Palestinians did not support them, “it is due 
 to external agitators, "Iran instigated," was the ... consequence of 
 various connive conspiracy by non -slaves ”, there have been 
 “Fugs of news within the security establishment of security 
 Israeli". With blacks and Palestinians intellectually null, “each 
 party has chosen his favorite enemy as the conspirator plus 
 probable ... [and] he accused himself of being the mind behind the 
 revolt". The British, the realists and the mules were in Haiti; in 
 Palestine, Iran was the mind, and behind them, Russia and China.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, some will probably rush to throw insults or ad 
 accuse me of naivety for neglecting the clear facts (as if 
 I was the empire) of Zionist knowledge. I will clarify. None of this 
 that I wrote is to say that the Zionist regime certainly does not 
 he knew - even if my visceral instinct still hesitates to believe that 
 he knew - but rather that the operation was unthinkable for them, that 
  their knowledge/not knowing is irrelevant, and that the development of 
 events and their results are not in their omnipotent hands, but in those 
  of the Palestinians, of the owners of the earth and resistance.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is interesting to note that, among all the work of tachigraphy 
 imperial presented in the Times survey on the Al-Aqsa flood, 
 There is a line that has been neglected and underestimated especially in 
 effort to bomb the revolutionary successes of 7 October in the Kingdom 
 of the Empirium, under siege, or rather, without memory.
 </p>
 <p>
  It can therefore be deduced that this sentence has a potential truth:
 </p>
 <p>
  “[Israel kept the] fatally inaccurate conviction that Hamas 
 He did not have the ability to attack and would not have dared to do it ... [one] 
 conviction thus rooted in the Israeli government ... to ignore the 
 growing evidence of the opposite ".
 </p>
 <p>
  Note the perception of Palestinian inability - and docility 
 through fear - as well as the recognition that an operation of 
 genre was so viscerally unthinkable that the Zionists, like the 
 Europeans of 1792, they have disavowed their own eyes. Such is 
 The arrogance of the empire, and here is its destruction.
 </p>
 <p>
  Imperialism is based on the idea itself, on the centrality and 
 supremacy of the ego on those who await the conquest and the 
 civilization. The primarity of the empire rests on secondary 
 of the other. Imperial superiority is based on native inferiority. 
 Yet, paradoxically, this secondary and inferiority are 
 indispensable to the primarity and superiority of the European and the Empire. 
  Events such as the Haitian revolution, the attack on the Milk Bar e 
 The flood of Al-Aqsa, invert, overturn or shatter completely 
 These hierarchies.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore, for the native, this violence is a "purifying force", 
 frees him “from his inferiority complex, from his despair and 
 inertia; It makes it fearless and restores self -respect. To do this, 
 If the native frees itself from its inferiority complex, it is no longer 
 inferior; If it is no longer lower, the colonizer is not higher; self 
 The colonizer is not superior, then the idea of empire comes 
 Compromise, the idols collapse and imperialism falls.
 </p>
 <p>
  Therefore
  <b>
   , writes Fanon, “it is precisely when he [the 
 native] realizes his humanity that begins to sharpen the weapons with which 
  The victory will ensure. "
  </b>
  The function of rationalizing theories 
 which clarify the unthinkable then becomes evident: it is the 
 preservation of the domain, of the hierarchy, the future of the colonists, the 
 imperial self.
 </p>
 <p>
  The threat posed by any act of indigenous resistance in 
 Any part of the colonized world is not simply a threat 
 material for its direct objective or for the local lordship, but a 
 existential scourge against empire and imperialism in his 
 complex. In the always relevant words of Ghassan Kanafani, 
 "Imperialism has placed its body in the world, her head in Asia 
 Eastern, the heart in the Middle East, its arteries reach 
 Africa and Latin America. Wherever you hit him, damn him and serve the 
  World Revolution ".
 </p>
 <p>
  I have to conclude with an explanation. The idea for this piece is to me 
 came for the first time on October 7th. Since then I have thought of 
 Writing it, but I found myself blocked by the devastation of the genocide. 
  How can I write about something in addition to the genocide? In fact, while 
 You are reading this piece, a Palestinian child - the soul of the soul 
  of someone - he was assassinated to Gaza. Every 7 minutes. As i 
  days were transformed into months, thinking, talking or writing about 
 anything else seemed more and more inappropriate, even 
 immoral. After an endless debate, I remembered the scheme 
 of colonial history: after an act of resistance of the natives it arrives the 
 More ferocious and unbridled brutality than the colony of settlers. It is designed 
 To teach a lesson, to make his triumphs forget - native - 
  however small - in order to swallow it in the fire and drown it in 
 blood until it consumes it. It cannot be afforded that this cancellation 
  And conquest remain unchallenged.
 </p>
 <p>
  While we look at the press agencies, politicians, ideologists and 
  spectators to explain an unprecedented situation, depriving the 
 Palestinians of free will - and of humanity - we must recognize 
 The hygiene, civil and trivializing gear of the machine 
  imperial at stake. While the bombs fall on Gaza, trying to 
 cancel the memory of the Palestinians of their victory, to bury 
  under the rubble their glimmer of liberation and to delete from 
 world the memory of their presence,
  <b>
   we must not forget. 7 
 October, Palestine has overturned the imperial world order and today, or 
  Tomorrow, in ten or one hundred years, it will be free.
