   In each new “feast of democracy” 
 revisionism tries to convince the Galician proletariat that the regime 
 Spanish is a neutral instrument, which is not the enemy of the Galician people. O 
 revisionism tries to hide that the Spanish regime is the instrument of 
 alliance between the Galician bourgeoisie and the Spanish bourgeoisie, in addition to 
 other allied secondary social classes and strata, such as the 
 clergy, from uncleshowed sectors, etc.

  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   A 
  political practice of revisionism always strengthens the bourgeois state 
 because always keeps alive the idea that through the elections, the 
 institutes and the reforms of the bourgeois state is possible, to eliminate the 
 destructive character of capitalist society, or that it is possible to eliminate the 
  trend for new interimperialist wars, which is possible 
 eliminate the capitalist accumulation law that determines that the increase in 
 wealth of a few people implies the poverty of many other 
 people in the world, or that it is possible to regulate the maximum differences between the 
  income of the bourgeoisie and the salary of the working class through taxes, 
 etc.
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Revisionism always tries to “save” 
  Work Class of his “Desilusom” in the bourgeois state. Even when the 
 revisionism calls for the “abstençom” always is because “nengumha of the options is 
 proper". Although revisionism calls for the “abstençom”, 
 unconsciously wants to make it clear that you don't want to consider the state 
 bourgeois like the enemy, who does not want to fight false illusions in 
 reform of the bourgeois state.
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Other revisionists will choose the same 
 That other times, for keeping silent over the parliamentary scam. For 
 Many is always the "least lummy" option. A LESS MALO THAT NEVER HAS 
 end, because there is always something worse but it is the “less malo” in the face of the new 
 even more element.
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   For revisionism the elections sound o 
 eternal process of “accumulation of forces”. An eternal “accumulation of 
 forces ”that never ends and that only serves to“ accumulate ”the common sense 
 of bourgeois ideology. A “accumulation of forces” that justifies everything 
 but that does not fit nothing if we want a "guide to Açom."
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   In the current situation of the proletariat 
 Galician, where there is no communist party that creates bonds that unite 
  avant -garde and the masses, any other political position different from 
 boycott, means renouncing bourgeois ideology. Means 
 deviate from the fair political line. Because renouncing to get out and 
 to denounce the class character of the state is to contribute to spreading to 
 Bourgeois ideology. So much has revisionism to speak a lot about 
 unionism, anti -fascism, socialism, communism, etc., because its 
 program and your practice only serve to justify some versom 
 Obreirista, or postmodern, from bourgeois ideology.
  </p>
  <p class="has-text-align-justify">
   DRAFPAR THE CLASS CHARACTER 
  Spanish as the political power of the Galician bourgeoisie in alliance with the 
 Spanish and Polo bourgeoisie as much as, the main enemy of the people 
 Galician is fundamental in the work of communist agitation. Seamless 
 awareness of the class character of the Spanish regime it is impossible to have 
 awareness of the social reality of the world.
