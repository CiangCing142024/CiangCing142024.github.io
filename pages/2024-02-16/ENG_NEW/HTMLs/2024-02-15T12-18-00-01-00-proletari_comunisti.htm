 <p>
  Workers and workers, it is truly a shame what yesterday is 
 Success in Naples and Turin. Two manifestations of young people e 
 very young, belonging to the student movement, in 
 particular in Turin the students of "We change course", the 
 solidarity activists with Palestine, belonging to several 
 associations, to power to the people, to reality of the social centers, ad 
 Askatasuna in Turin, in Naples to the various active social realities that 
 They rightly protested under the direction of Rai.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This Rai does 
 disgusting, has become telemelons in the hands of the men of the government as never 
 It was seen before. Even before, television was in the hands of the 
 Parties, he was in the hands of governments, for heaven's sake, let alone! We have 
 views of cooked and raw and we know how they are placed at Rai 
 Journalists/Journalists…. not to use vulgar words.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But Telemeloni lo 
 It does with arrogance. He says he is "rebalancing" for them that they are 
 have been excluded for years. False! Men of this government or parties 
 of this government there have been - all right - within the Rai, if they are 
 SHOPT FIRST, Just think of Salvini, and we spread a pitiful veil 
 on Forza Italia by Berlusconi. They would be the last ones who can 
 speak in this way, but they are doing it, they are doing it 
 And in a vulgar, arrogant, provocative way they are implementing it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And which means 
 Telemeloni? that you must not say things that can disturb the 
 government and his
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 propagated image H 24 on these televisions e 
 who does not hesitate to use anything: the last they used is the 
 Sanremo Festival, where first/during and after we witnessed a 
 Manfrines against the political use of the Festival, only to use it. AND 
 When a Ghali singer dared to remember with a short performance 
 - 5 minutes! - that a genocide is taking place in Palestine, where they are 
 So far about 30,000 people died, mostly children and teenagers, 
 where there is a people who are hunted for the fury of bombs from their own 
 Houses, from all over the Gaza strip, don't know where they have to put them, 
 they want them or bury or carry on the moon possibly, the 
 Nazi's Nazi -type Zionist regime, supported by everyone 
 those hypocrites, from explicit ones such as American imperialism, 
 specialist in massacres, etc ... ecc .., and by those implicit like i 
 European governments, the Italian government, accomplices of genocide.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is not of 
 This we want to talk, we talk about it every day. Let's talk about the 
 the fact that Ghali says "genocide" and breaks out who knows what! The 
 Sanremo Festival must only be songs. We are not experts of 
 this, but there would be many stories to tell, stories and 
 History.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But what is 
 scandalous is that Rai censors the singers when they piss out of the 
 jar. And as soon as this indignation and solidarity realities with the cause 
 Palestinian - many boys take to the streets to protest - 
 Mazzate, Manganelli like Selvaggi, just see the videos.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, it's not that 
 one goes under Rai and says "bad", he calls them Assassini, 
 It is not that it goes under Rai and can accept that there is one 
 Schiament of policemen as the criminal gangs are coming. 
 And then loaded, blows, blood in the face, split heads.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Daughters 
 stepchildren. There are those who can block the roads legitimately, there are those who 
 He can tell all the colors and nothing happens to him. There are the 
 guys who go in solidarity with Palestine to say 
 "Genocide", like the singer and to solidarize, and down them 
 blow!
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Here, this is 
 Fascism, it was a police, it is arrogance of power, it is dictatorship! 
 These things are seen in Hungary where there is Ilaria Salis or in America 
 Latina where South American dictatorships are famous. But these 
 dictatorships are arriving in Italy through the Meloni government, the 
 Garbatella fascistella, ascent to the throne, behind the face 
 so -called "clean" are the worms that use the state for 
 occupy it, the televisions to occupy them, the institutions for 
 occupy them. And down to get with the police.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Solidarity, 
 solidarity and we do 10-100-1000 events of this type 
 Where there are the Rai offices, let's do other where there are no 
 Rai offices, we choose the objectives consistent with this, we break the 
 censorship, we say a simple truth: in Palestine there is a 
 genocide. Enough, we don't want anything else.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Even the 
 government says, they are exaggerating, they had to kill 10,000, we are 
 arrived at 30,000, they had to kill the terrorists, then the terrorists 
 They are all and we all kill them.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this sense 
 This thing is important, because - attention - so far on 
 work, on salary, on the houses and so on, we joked 
 we would say to the masses, we did not do anything in front of the wages 
 cut, to the denied work, to the health on which we find a veil 
 pitiful. And what about the school? Casomai we talk about it later.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is good if the 
 masses protest seriously and do neither processions, that “the 
 Government must help us ", blah blah blah ... are blows.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But who sows 
 Wind collects storm. Be careful that foolish boys are not, 
 You can't take them and that's it. Think, experience and this 
 experience we hope that it serves because if these governments do not do 
 They go with their own legs, they will have to go to other forms.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Solidarity with 
 The boys of Turin and Naples attacked and beaten by the police 
 Under Rai.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Via Tele Meloni! 
 And not because we expect a lot, but a little decency ce 
 We would wait for her.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Or we will end up the 
 Will Rai manage Sgarbi?
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We continue to talk about school again. Certainly the students 
 They are not a wonder both for the levels of education they receive 
 in these schools, both for what happens to him as soon as they come out of 
 School: unemployment, precarious jobs or staying at home 
 of families are not known for how many years, families who when 
 they are those of the workers who bleed to ensure 
 education and a future and which instead are always in a school 
 more class, where there must be an elite that can go to 
 school and enter the so -called company, which is then the capital, 
 in the so -called political world, which is then carrierism, 
 traffic and lecying.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Well, the 
 Students occasionally lift their heads and protest. 
 First of all they did it with great generosity against 
 the school/work alternation which, in the name of learning the 
 craft while you go to school, they sent them to the mistake to do 
 Internships in some factories and boys died.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One went to 
 school, led him to the internship and never returned home.

 </div>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that i 
 guys they mobilized against school/work alternation, have 
 said enough, they protested, they made children who died of theirs 
 Symbols - positive symbols - showing those who scare what pasta 
 they are really made when they embrace important and non -important issues 
 unfortunately cracks.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now instead we are 
 passed to phase 2. A minister, an illustrious stranger, of those 
 ridiculous professors, from television fiction, of the last century, that 
 Now he is minister, Valditara, who one day pretends to deal with the 
 school in terms actually of what the school is o 
 it should be and in the 364 days only deals with repression, of 
 how to ensure that schools are a barrack 
 to which educational institutions are untouchable. Indeed, that if the 
 Touch the life sentence should give you, not to mention the normal 
 Student activities.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There are periods 
 in which the students, to make their voices heard, do the 
 strikes, the events. They occupy schools, it is their way 
 natural to be heard. In these schools it is not that it happens who knows 
 What during the months of education. Indeed, many times, during the 
 occupations "something happens" and when "something happens", 
 not the inevitable and unbalanced vandalism acts, but when 
 In the occupations it is protesting, we think, they deepen things 
 And certainly not only of the school, but of the world around them. Why 
 This school is neither a happy island, nor a ghetto is in 
 world and the world is made of wars, of genocides in Palestine, of 
 Things that every day should make you indignant and is 
 Right that the students take care of it.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Well, now the 
 occupations are reason for votes in conduct etc. etc., it seems 
 Really that we went back to the last century.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Things like this 
 they originated the greatest movement of students in the history of 
 This country that is called '68. Do you want a new '68? Well, 
 Maybe you are giving it to us.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Rather than 
 Thinking about what can happen, let's look at what happens. 
 Students cannot be repressed because they occupy schools. Not 
 small episodes can be demanded during the 
 occupations as if they had set the country on fire. Here, this is not 
 can do.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore in the 
 schools must be contrasted any repressive measure to 
 Who expresses dissent, who struggle, who occupies.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Barracks School 
 of Valditara must not pass.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we have 
 Used the word school-chaserma and this means that in schools 
 Is there an exaggerated discipline and repression if you violate it? NO! vuol 
 To say that school/work alternation must be alternated school/barracks. 
 Schools must be militarized and when they put on - e 
 This government seems specialist - they make it dirty: they managed to 
 put the uniform also to children, using instrumentally 
 Various issues. The idea of the militarization of the school, 
 military training, to make the idea of restoration penetrate 
 At the end of the military lever - now we speak of the reservists, then yes 
 It will talk about new recruits - it is the prospect of using young people 
 depending on the war.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  You want that 
 We all say we don't want more wars, you want us to 
 We declare pacifists. Unfortunately in power there are warfondonas a 
 service of those who earn wars, that is, profits 
 of the war industry and the system of multinationals that on 
 wars earn exceptional profits, they are governments that use the 
 State budget such as ATM, personal banks 
 of the war industry - This part of the budget is not touched! -  And 
 All this falls into the student condition, in trying to 
 truly transform school into that of fascism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this does not 
 must pass. It is a problem of the students for which it is right 
 rebel, but it is a problem of workers, of the "citizens", 
 As they say, where for "citizens" we are a little diverted. 
 We think of the popular masses, those who live in work or that not 
 They live, and, if they live, they live in precariousness and not work. Well, 
 It is a question. They cannot consider the school only in 
 to which their children must be protected, to interviews with professors or if 
 There is some professor who says a bad word must be insulted and 
 Sometimes attacked - lousy things regardless. But they must 
 occupy the future, of what really happens in the school e 
 of what is the future of the new generations that is in the school 
 the center.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These ministers 
 they cannot exist, these governments are a curse for the 
 present and for the future of the school and the future of the children is 
 First of all in the head. To then say everything else.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So no to 
 school-school.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No to alternation 
 school/work.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No to 
 repression in schools.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For a school 
 in the hands of the students, not to make them who knows that, but why if 
 There is an use of them and transform the school into a true school of life, school 
 of ideas, school of criticism, school of freedom, democracy and, in 
 future, a school service of all the people.
