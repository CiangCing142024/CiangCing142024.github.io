  The struggle of workers historically is always the union struggle of 
 workers, and is concentrated on two problems, i.e. working hours and salary like two 
 Central issues that animate the clash between masters and workers. THE 
 Masters always say that "we are in the same boat", if I go 
 Well you will be well workers. And the government the same. He says 
 Meloni explicitly: we work for companies to earn 
 So they earn workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We know yes 
 It is a fairy tale. Who has a minimum of brain on the spot of 
 I work well that it doesn't work like this.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But in each 
 case two issues are in the center and which are in the center today 
 because we are in difficulty as a worker movement, like struggles of 
 workers and workers: the question of salary and the question 
 of the time.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Germany, for 
 example, the struggle of 80,000 steel shadows obtained the reduction 
 time from 35 to 32 hours

 paid 33, together with a one -off of 3,000 
 € that held in 1994 and a 5.5% wage increase from 
 2025.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There 
 justification of the German unions is simple: after 
 The introduction of new plants will serve less hours of work for the 
 steel production. Hence the speech of the 4 days of 
 I work for the same salary that find a justification in the 
 development of production itself, and in the shortest time of work that 
 It is used to produce what was previously produced in longer.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The masters don't 
 they are never, because for them all that is not necessary work 
 It is surplus value, that is, profit. So says the newspaper of 
 Entrepreneurs in Germany: "Yes, it would be nice but wrong".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The goodsense 
 He says that “a week of 4 days, with the same remuneration, 
 could make a significant contribution to maintaining the car sector 
 attractive for young people. It would be a tested remedy for deficiency 
 of labor ". This does not say it who knows which Marxist or which one 
 Communist but the president of the metalworking union says so 
 main in Germany.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  They seem 
 expressions of pure common sense and common sense should be 
 even at the base of the trade union platforms and the struggle in 
 breasts to the factories.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand 
 It would be enough to ask the workers and in Germany they did it. A 
 survey reported by the French newspaper, the Monde, resumes it and 
 He says: 75% of German workers would like to go to 4 days a 
 Salary equality. And it reaffirms that this would be even more 
 palatable for young people, who certainly think that they must be on 
 workplace 8 hours and then extraordinary and then etc etc. it is not that the 
 It seems an acceptable future.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The struggle for the 
 Reduction from working hours to equal pay is the struggle of 
 Lotte for the worker movement. Today in all the factories of Italy, 
 like in Europe and the world.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, the crisis, 
 the attack on the workplace, the reduction of wages, dissuade from 
 think that this struggle can be done. And then make this struggle 
 It seems more a problem than a solution.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is this 
 which is to be overturned. We started that this thing happened 
 First of all, among the steelurgicals. Let's think about the crisis 
 of the steel industry - so not to make names of the former Ilva, of 
 Italian steel mills - such as the reduction in working hours to the same 
 pays both the right and necessary claim to face too 
 the states of crisis, conversion/transformation that these 
 industries necessarily have to cross.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the problem is 
 Always this: the difficulty of fighting for the reduction of the time 
 of work in the face of wages that are not defended. The defense of 
 salary is the food necessary to be able to seriously do the struggle 
 for the reduction of working hours but it is on the wage front that 
 Instead we see the strongest retreat of workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The relationship between 
 The inflation and recovery of wages is clearly disadvantage of 
 wages.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The struggle for the 
 salary, however, cannot be made with contracts that produce 
 Salary increases of little more than a coffee per day. If the 
 salary has been cut dryly it is evident that it must be recovered 
 dryly and the roads have always been only two: reintroduction 
 of the escalator to mitigate the effects of caravan, 
 inflation and price increase and wage increase 
 corresponding to productivity, not that calculated by the masters, 
 but the one objectively visible from the amount of work to do 
 The products that are made within the factories.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is around 
 These two things that are grafted the wage increase that today, for 
 be imposed, it must start from the jobs. So it happened 
 also in France and in other countries. We must not wait for the contracts. 
 When wages descend - and in this period they go down - you have to 
 Starting with real wage disputes, it would take at least requests 
 of € 500 to be able to rebalance. Then they get a little less, 
 But the important thing is to leave, the wage struggle is certain 
 Even in contracts, fight and what is not touched is the request 
 wage. Instead normally we start from a figure and you get to a 
 coffee a day.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Inside, however, the 
 wage issue is the question of discrimination within breast 
 to the factories. And on this we should talk about it for a long time. The 
 wage differences between workers and workers. Wages that 
 They are given to the less protected sectors, to immigrant workers. AND 
 etc. On this there are irrefutable data of the permanence and 
 extension of wage discrimination.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For the same 
 Work must be equal to salary. This applies above all 
 for workers and even more - given the situation - for the 
 immigrant workers.
