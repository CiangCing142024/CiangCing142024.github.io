  From the "What to do?": "But why the spontaneous movement ... goes towards 
 The dominance of bourgeois ideology? For the simple reason that 
 For its origin, bourgeois ideology is much older than 
 the socialist one, it is more elaborate in all its aspects e 
 It has incomparably larger means of diffusion ... "
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Still, in a note: 
 “It is often said the working class aspires spontaneously to 
 socialism. This is very right in the sense that more deeply e 
 more exactly than all the others the socialist theory determines the 
 causes of the ailments of the working class and therefore the workers can 
 assimilate it easily,
  <i>
   so long as
  </i>
  this theory not chapters 
 in front of spontaneity,
  <i>
   so long as
  </i>
  we do not subject to the 
 spontaneity, the working class aspires spontaneously to socialism 
 but the bourgeois ideology that is the most widespread (and that constantly 
 It rises in the most varied forms), however, it is imposed 
 spontaneously more than any other at the worker.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Referring to 
 Journal of Economism, Rabociaja Myisl Lenin writes: “Don't denial 
 completely the political struggle ... speaks of the fight against the government ... 
 He just thinks that politics always follows
  <span>
  </span>
 </p>
 <a name="more">
 </a>
 the economy ... these 
 thesis are absolutely false,
 <i>
  If by politics we mean the 
 social democratic policy
 </i>
 (Communist editor's note). The economic struggle 
 of the workers, as we have seen, is very often linked (although not 
 inextricably) to bourgeois politics ... politics 
 tradunionist is the general aspiration of all workers ad 
 obtain direct measures against the ailments proper to the state of the 
 their condition, but not yet suitable to suppress this condition, 
 that is, to destroy the submission of work to capital ... 
 So, there is politics and political ... ".
 <p>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Economists 
 “By fully recognizing the growing political struggle 
 spontaneously from the same worker movement (or rather the 
 claims and political aspirations of the workers) ... refuse 
 Absolutely to independently elaborate a policy ... specifies 
 who responds to the tasks of socialism and current conditions ", 
 of the country and the class struggle.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Lenin continuing 
 In the examination of other forms of economism, he takes in 
 consideration those who give much weight to the spontaneous struggle of 
 workers, who of course when he begins to wake up grabs the first 
 means of struggle that happen, but clearly these first means 
 They will be the tradunionists and the first ideology that happens will be 
 Always bourgeois ideology ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Lenin does not put in 
 discussion this process nor “that the mass worker movement 
 It is a very important phenomenon is something on which there is no discussion. But the 
 question lies in the way of understanding how this movement
  <i>
   It will determine the tasks.
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   There 
 What can be understood in two ways, or in the sense of the cult of the 
 spontaneity of this movement, that is, the reduction of the role 
 of social democracy to pure servility towards the 
 worker movement as such ...,
  </span>
  <i>
   or
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   in the sense that the mass movement places us
  </span>
  <i>
   new
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   assignments 
 Theoretical, political, organizational much more complex ... ".
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   Lenin 
 continues examining how economists, even when they do 
 right political statements, always translate them into forms of 
 adaptation to the existing movement; and contrasts with them 
 The organization for political struggle. And takes into consideration 
 Some aspects of this position of economists.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   In 
 A note is written: “The theory of stadiums, or shy theory 
 Zig-Zag, it is expressed as follows: common political claims ... 
 However, they must correspond in the early days to the experience that a 
 determined layer of workers has obtained from the economic struggle. 
 Only on the ground of this experience can it be and must 
 undertake political agitation ".
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   AND 
 To strengthen this concept, economists argue: “Which 
 Social Democrat does not know that according to Marx and Engels' doctrine 
 The economic interests of the individual classes perform a function 
 decisive in history and that,
  </span>
  <i>
   consequently
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   , 
 In particular, the struggle of the proletariat for his interests 
 economic must have a primary meaning for its development of 
 class and the emancipator struggle? ".
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   Lenin 
 Reply: “This is consequently absolutely inappropriate. From the 
 the fact that economic interests perform a decisive function not
  </span>
  <i>
   derives at all
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   no 
 consequence on the primary meaning of the economic struggle (= 
 union), because the most essential "decisive" interests 
 classes can be satisfied
  </span>
  <i>
   only
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   with radical transformations
  </span>
  <i>
   policies
  </i>
  <span style="font-style: normal;">
   in general; in particular, the fundamental economic interest of 
 proletariat can only be satisfied through a revolution 
 policy that replaces the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie 
 of the proletariat ".
