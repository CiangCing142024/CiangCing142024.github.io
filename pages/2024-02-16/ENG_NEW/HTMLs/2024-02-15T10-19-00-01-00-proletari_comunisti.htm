  Let's start this press review on the events of the Budapest Hungary, 
 on what happened this weekend starting from the newspapers 
 Hungarians online, in particular we will redo us goods that can be 
 traced back to an area of the left and opposition to the government 
 Orban, but we also took a look at national newspapers 
 officers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are there 
 focusing on this weekend because it was two 
 days when what we learned in Italy took place at 
 know how the "day of honor", that is, a commemoration 
 Nazi -fascist who has become the pretext for a meeting 
 International of Nazis and Fascists in Budapest. Meeting that takes place 
 above all because, as their leaders often declared, now 
 Hungary has become a safe place where you can freely meet, 
 freely show off the typical fascist symbols such as leisure, the 
 Nazi uniforms of the SS, where to make propaganda and in any case find 
 The opportunity to meet internationally.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These days 
 It was also an opportunity for an anti -fascism response 
 international. Last year this answer determined clashes 
 and violence between the fascist groups and the anti -fascists who brought 
 to arrests of some international anti -fascists, including ours 
 Ilaria Salis, of which the story is known and of which we will try to 
 Speak a little towards the end.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Concentrate 
 On the two days we can say that February 10 and February 11th 
 are considered as the commemoration of the siege of Budapest, a 
 Historical fact of the Second World War where the red army 
 Soviet by now surrounded Budapest - because Hungary was 
 Collaboration of Nazism - in an siege that ended with 
 the capitulation of both the occupant Nazi army and the 
 Hungarian collaborators.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Actually 11 
 February 1945, the "day of honor", what is called 
 So from the Nazi formations, he wants to remember an episode 
 specific, that is, the attempt by the Nazi army, 
 Hungarian army, a collaborator to break through this siege 
 making a suicidal attack on the mountains of Buda, then on the part 
 tall of the city of Budapest, which led to the massacre of 14,000 
 Germans and 2000 Hungarian soldiers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This was 
 The last attempt of the Nazi and Hungarian fascist rods of 
 not capitular and the result was however the liberation of Budapest 
 and of the country by the Nazis.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This aspect 
 historian it is important to know why this day of 
 commemoration of the siege of Budapest and its victims is a commemoration that has been taking place for many years, until 
 from the period in which Hungary was part of the Soviet bloc e 
 represented an initially anti -fascist anniversary, in the sense of one 
 recurrence that recalled the liberation of Hungary and the triumph e 
 the entrance of the red army. Only that for 10 years, taking like 
 episode this attempt to escape and evasion of the Nazis of '45 
 From the siege, today's Nazis have made one of them 
 day. And for several years the response of anti -fascism is not one 
 Make it wait.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Then let's see 
 this year. Last year there were clashes between both 
 Parts, there have been arrests of anti -fascists, including Ilaria Salis. 
 This year we see that from the newspapers that the events are 
 turned out to be peaceful, there have been no clashes, this for 
 the huge presence of the police who protected the fascists and avoided 
 contacts with anti -fascist groups. In reality there have been many 
 identification of anti -fascists, even those from outside 
 of Hungary and the arrest of a group of Germans is recorded 
 anti -fascists. On the other hand, it is ironic to think that, perhaps just a 
 cause of the fuss raised on the question of Ilaria Salis, 
 This year the government had forbidden the Nazi gatherings, made them 
 practically illegal, unless he did nothing for really 
 prevent them.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Fascist groups 
 appointments have been given on this day that was articulated not 
 only with events and commemorations, but also with concerts of 
 Filonazist groups and have not communicated in a manner 
 publishes the meeting places, even if the meeting places are then 
 more or less those of last year, in particular the castle of 
 Buda who is in the area where this attempt was in '45 of 
 evasion by the Nazi army and on the other hand they have 
 disguised their propaganda by passing it with a tour 
 commemorative. The result was therefore that in any case the 
 fascist manifestation has had and it was not really 
 It prevented, simply on a formal level it was prohibited.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand - i 
 newspapers emphasize it, especially the thread government - there is 
 A great emphasis in saying that this year everyone was given 
 right to manifest, also to the anti -fascist forces, which have been 
 authorized that therefore nothing could be charged at the level of 
 antidemocratic to this government, unless it emerges from 
 description of the goods of goods, of this leftist newspaper, 
 the attention of the police, both at the level of controls, of arrests - 
 As in the case of the German group - towards the anti -fascists it is 
 was much higher than that made against the fascists.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Twice 
 standard towards the treatment of anti -fascists compared to 
 treatment of anti -fascists is a custom here in Hungary, 
 precisely because the Hungarian government of Orban has this absolute 
 proximity to fascist groups and uses anti -fascism as a form 
 Not only of external repression, but also of internal repression. 
 In fact on this it would be appropriate to dwell by reading a little 
 These online newspapers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The manifestations 
 anti -fascists that are in Budapest and who have been repeated for 10 years, 
 as well as the fascist manifestations, they see a variety of 
 subjects present, not only international, such as those he had 
 Italy joined Italy, but also - and above all - anti -fascist groups 
 Hungarian.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Indeed 
 The image that comes to us from Hungary is often a bit 
 flattened on a single form of authoritarian government such as that of 
 Orban, which is certainly there, as a kind of approval 
 politics.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In reality we are 
 verifying that anti -fascism seeks in some way also there 
 be heard. In this case the manifestations of 10 and 11 
 February of Saturday and Sunday there were, they also saw the 
 presence of members of the Hungarian resistance - a bit like 
 Our Anpi - and also the other more contemporary forces that 
 claim anti -fascism, even one has been launched 
 event that had as the title “let's stop glorifying the 
 Nazism in Hungary ". This also makes it clear that the support that 
 Orban actually gives the Nazi formations to this celebration has 
 as a purpose above all that of having a sort of recognition 
 politic.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fact the 
 affair of Ilaria Salis, reading the newspapers makes us understand that it entered 
 in an international game, also of pressure from the Union 
 European, there was the speech linked to the release of funding 
 For the war in Ukraine to which Orban has sold, giving his vote 
 positive for a new loan, but he used the story, 
 irreducibility, inflexibility towards Ilaria as 
 international tool to demonstrate within not selling 
 So easily to the pressure of the European Union, to pressure 
 international.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Anti -fascism 
 associated with terrorism, with violence, it is for the government of Orban, one 
 perfect excuse to criminalize any internal opposition that 
 It is not so flattened: last year Hungary was 
 crossed by great protests, both student and linked to 
 LGBT Movement, both of teachers against a very school reform 
 heavy in a neoliberal key, manifestations that there have been, that 
 they were repressed hard with arrests, charges, layoffs 
 of teachers. And then a whole a mechanism of repression in which 
 Ilaria Sarris in some way is suffering personally, but 
 that Hungarian opponents suffer, probably daily, 
 both from the procedural point of view and from the point of view of the 
 prison conditions, which from the point of view of repression 
 social at work, on the movement. The economic crisis, inflation e 
 high prices, the work crisis, external addiction 
 of Hungary, is making the Orban government vacillating that 
 So last year he found as a perfect scapegoat to be 
 external but above all internal the anti -fascist as a criminal e 
 terrorist, and this also makes you understand the fury from Ilaria 
 Salis.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this year 
 International pressures have had the effect of trying to do 
 appear a lower profile by the government than 
 to the support for these Nazi formations. And on the other hand, instead of 
 totally discourage anti -fascism, made it quite more 
 lively. We have seen that the anti -fascist manifestations are there 
 State, they were various, there have been no clashes for the presence 
 of the police. But the words were clear against the return 
 of fascism, against revisionism.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We cannot say 
 That this is leading to a real immediate turning point, indeed. 
 Orban's fascism took one step more than the action 
 repressive, but also with respect to a historical revisionism: in fact, 
 Just the Orban government, together with these Nazi formations that yes 
 they usually gather in Budapest and find space and consent, yes 
 they are promoting at the level of the European Union of 
 An attribution of the responsibility of the Second World War 
 to the same Soviet Union, an impressive historical reversal 
 However, it makes the game, even internal, to lead to one 
 criminalization of anti -fascists as terrorists and criminals 
 and therefore the real risk is that if there is no turning point the year 
 next, perhaps the anti -fascist manifestations could 
 be the prohibited and more criminalized ones.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This year is 
 was an interlocutory commemoration that we will see in the future 
 It really has meant.
