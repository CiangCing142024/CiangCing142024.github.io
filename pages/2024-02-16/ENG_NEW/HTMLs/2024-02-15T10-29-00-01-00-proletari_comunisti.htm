 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We resume this week at 12 noon counter -information Rosso Operaia 
 First of all, informing those who listen to us that the new number has come out 
 of the printed newspaper which is taken from the counter -information 
 daily we do four times a week in this new 
 year. The printed number has a particular function, that of 
 Select between the themes and pieces covered in the daily 
 Audio counter -information and make a direct intervention tool 
 Among the workers, the workers, the masses, both first of all to the places of 
 work, to the concierge of the factories, in the assemblies of 
 workers held by the Slai Cobas or by the various organizations 
 trade unions and be used in participation in the events and 
 They are held in various realities during the week.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This number 
 contains and resumes the problem of the war and the role of Italy 
 in the war commenting on the interview with that pig who is the 
 Minister Crosetto, peak minister of the Meloni government, linked e 
 salary - as has been shown - by the big industries 
 Belliche, in particular by Leonardo. This minister is now the 
 Official voice of the worst wing of militarism and imperialism 
 Italian.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Did 
 An interview that we commented. This comment is present in 
 printed number of 12 hours to be released today under the title "The 
 Meloni/Crosetto government goes to the wars for profits and wants i 
 reservists ".
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Another article 
 which is contained is that relating to Meloni's journey in 
 Japan who, beyond how it was presented and uncensized and al 
 beyond the objective fact that Meloni went to Japan to 
 collect the scepter for the management of the new G7 - which this year 
 It is held in Italy, in Puglia, around mid -June - that 
 It will be very important both for our country and at the level 
 world. We are among those who want this G7 to be 
 strongly contested in June, with a great participation 
 national and international. But in the meantime the trip to Japan is 
 was also much more, like all the recent trips of Meloni: 
 On the one hand the placer of the masters, he goes there to tighten bonds 
 cheap with large industries, with the large multinationals of 
 Japan, to favor both the ties with Italy and serve them on a 
 silver plate within the criticality of Italian situations such as 
 Economic platform at the service of general economic interests 
 of imperialism and masters. Think of the car sector, think 
 to steel, etc. etc.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other element 
 of these travels are to bind militarily, organize the 
 Military Italian presence - In this case in the great and strategic 
 Pacific indoor chessboard where the reasons are also accumulating there 
 of the clash between the imperialist powers, primarily US/China in 
 march that unfortunately seems unstoppable towards a third conflict 
 World - And in this context Meloni acts as a Piazzista 
 of the war industry, cannon merchants, as the title says.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other part of 
 This printed number is linked to the protest of farmers. The 
 title says everything: “The protest of farmers also represents 
 The interest of workers and masses? ”To this question the articles 
 made by the audio counter -information say no and try to 
 explain it by giving a tool to the proletarians and popular masses for 
 to orient themselves between the right things and the wrong things of this great 
 protest.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Finally two pages 
 We have dedicated this young man to the freedom of Ilaria Salis 
 anti -fascist, truly courageous, active, which went to challenge the 
 Nazis and the regime that protects them with Orban, great friend of Salvini 
 And Meloni, it is a real heroine of our time. And for this, 
 As many times it has happened to the heroes and heroines in the events 
 historical, it is treated like a beast chained when the real 
 Beasts are in government and real beasts are friends in Italy of 
 This government.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A page is 
 dedicated to the struggle and contradictions present in the two greats 
 Industrial factories or complexes of our country: to Stellantis 
 Mirafiori where the workers took to strike and this is one 
 very good news against the closing plans of 
 reduction of masters and the contradictions between masters and 
 government downloaded to workers.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And the other is the 
 Infinite affair of the former Ilva where - in particular in the Ilva contract 
 - A life is fought for life and death, certainly not of the 
 establishment - or we would also say of the plant - but first of all 
 The life of the workers of the contract that are all at home in the cashier 
 integration, anteroom of redundancies and layoffs, while it continues 
 The theater of the absurd of the comparison masters - Arcelmitittal in 
 primis - government that, now as now, is downloaded to workers, 
 First of all also through non -payment of credits to 
 companies of the contract, many of which depend on these payments 
 for their business continuity.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 Counter -information rossusoia is a small number but with large ones 
 reasons and with great themes it addresses, which we distribute a 
 contribution or free of charge to workers, because workers must 
 have in their hands a concrete tool in the workplace for 
 be able to orient themselves on things and to be able to stabilize as a subject 
 real of our work, which then means worker autonomy, 
 organization, intensification of the class struggle against masters 
 and government but, in perspective, to overthrow government masters and the 
 their system.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The newspapers of 
 Today two things particularly highlight: what happens 
 in Palestine, where the regime of Zionist monsters, neo -Nazis, 
 represented by the state of Israel and its Netanyahu government, 
 protected armed from American imperialism and supported among all 
 governments, he wants to conduct another stage of the ongoing genocide, he wants 
 attack Rafah to massacre the Palestinians, drive them out like mice 
 from their land and get their hands on the entire strip of Gaza e 
 They make another piece of the state of Israel. A crime against 
 humanity, a genocide in place, as the Court of 
 European justice that opened a process on this - has it 
 declared admissible - that we must help to stop 
 First of all with the worker and popular mobilization, which serves not 
 only to express solidarity, but to force governments, institutions, 
 however they are, to contribute to the ceased the fire and to stop the 
 Genocida of Israel.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other aspect is 
 The potential agreement that would be made with a wing of 
 Movement of farmers, the one called "agricultural redemption" 
 and the government through the meetings that there were with the 
 Minister Lollobrigida. This agreement are the crumbs for whom 
 he really fought for survival, which serve to stop the 
 fight, both in the right reasons and in the reasons we call 
 unjust, that is, of those claims that we do not share and that 
 they are also linked to the relationship between the agricultural world and the government, 
 that certainly does not arise in these hours, but it is previous and is a part 
 of that world, that of landowners, medium producers, 
 who has already supported the government in his ascent.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So of this 
 agreement of one thing we are sure: it will not solve the problems of the 
 small agriculture, will not solve the problems of the workers of the 
 earth, will not solve the problems that originate unhealthy agriculture 
 and a frightening increase in prices, of agriculture products, 
 through the infamous chain that transforms them into profit for the 
 large trade multinationals.
