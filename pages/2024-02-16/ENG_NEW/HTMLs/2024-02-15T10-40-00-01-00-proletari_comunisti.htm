     There 
  decision by Italy to proceed with the extradition is to 
 enormous gravity, and the seriousness of the fact that it is taken into consideration 
  The extradition of a Palestinian citizen to the Israeli authorities 
 (on the basis of hypothetical resistance actions, held in the territories 
 employed, therefore protected by international law), are added 
 also a series of considerations dictated by the current situation 
 politics.

     In 
  primis Italy would deliver a Palestinian to the Israeli authorities, 
 which would process it in a military court. In addition, in the course 
 Of the last few months, there have been multiple organizations of organizations e 
 International associations for human rights that report the inhumane 
  Conditions of detention and torture in Israeli prisons.

     There 
  concern for the current situation is in the certainty that, in the event 
  of extradition, Anan's fate will be to be conducted 
 before a military court and subjected to inhuman treatments, 
 unthinkable prison conditions, conditions that today bring to 9 the 
 number of Palestinian political prisoners killed in the last four 
 months in Israeli prisons, died of torture and negligence 
 health.

     Furthermore, 
  In all likelihood, the elements on which they were formalized 
 accusations to Anan Yaeesh are the result of now well -known methods 
 investigation and interrogations considered illegal in Italy e 
 compatible with the definition of torture.

     We believe 
  that this episode also risks representing a dangerous 
 previous aimed at clearing the extradition and delivery of Palestinians in 
  Italy and in Europe on the request of Israel which, remember, door 
 a military occupation of the Palestinian territories ahead.
