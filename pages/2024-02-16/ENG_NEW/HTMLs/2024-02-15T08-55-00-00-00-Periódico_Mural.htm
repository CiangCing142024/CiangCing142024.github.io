  A little over a month of the state of exception and the declaration of the "internal armed conflict", where President Daniel Noboa recognized drug trafficking groups [1] in a belligerent force [1], the situation in that country evokes the period of the military dictatorship of 1963 until 1984, which was clearly a terrorist dictatorship of the great capital against the people.
 </p>
 <p>
  Things today are nothing different, and the pure declaration seems like a hoax in the terms that correctly characterizes the Communist Party of Ecuador-Sol Red
  <em>
   … “This declaration of internal conflict lacks the most elementary foundations that govern this scenario. • The bands do not pursue political objectives. • They have no political direction. • They do not have disciplined armed forces. • They do not control territories. • They have shown not willing to observe international war law. Under these premises, in Ecuador there is no internal war, there is no politically structured belligerent force, therefore, Noboa's statements and decisions are a hoax. ”
  </em>

  Some people think that it is the model-bukele applied in another country, but they remain in the media or "spectacular" part of the matter that seeks to distract the attention of the masses with news about mass arrests [most of them arbitrarily Innocent people], the "recovery of the State Rectory" on prisons, the construction of new high security prisons, and the state of siege with military and police combing the streets and towns of the whole country aboard patrols, vehicles, vehicles Artillery, firefighters, ambulances, etc. Reality goes beyond this and in fact it must be understood as an administrative and military self-golpe that undermines the political freedoms and fundamental rights of the workers and peoples of Ecuador under the pretext of fighting the "narco-terrorism" .

  Throughout this first month there are at least 80 thousand operations led by the Army where around 6 thousand people have arrested, 237 of them allegedly related to "terrorism." In all these arrests there is no clarity about the criminal proceedings, there is also no record of made available, links to the process or liberations, that is: there is no legal certainty or guarantees to due process for detained persons, which can result at risk of forced disappearances. In addition, some press monopolies speak of 10 people killed per day, most of them in the midst of clashes with security forces, which could be false positives.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now Noboa issues two new decrees where he calls a "plebiscite" on security matters (read the continuity of the militarization of the country [3]) and counter -reforms to the Constitution. Do not lose sight of the fact that next year there will be federal elections and will surely seek its re-election to continue the plan of the reaction with wide-colored-olive manga.

  Indeed, it is the fascistization of the old Ecuadorian state controlled by landowners and great bourgeois, which today again reaffirmed their subordination against Yankee imperialism by contending with other countries in the region to see who installs the largest and most efficient gringa military base in South America.
 </p>
 <p>
  In recent weeks and in the midst of the state of exception, high commanders of the American army and government have arrived in the country to provide their "support" to the Ecuadorian government, offering training, advice and financing. Precisely in that sense, the Government sells-Patrias of Daniel Noboa confirmed that he will seek more funds for his crusade and announced the delivery of military weapons and equipment of Soviet origin to the fascist government of Ukraine to support him in the war against Russia.

  Noboa had described as "scrap" this war material for which he will receive new military team for a value of up to 200 million dollars from the US imperialist government the idea of getting rid of the “obsolete” military team and receiving in Change new team of gringa technology is very good to fulfill the orders of their gringos masters: deepen the militarization of the country and reinforce its semi -colonial rivets as part of the counterinsurgent strategy. Therefore, the representative of Yankee imperialism in South America, Kevin Sullivan, has not been able to deny the joy of the government of Joe Biden who economically supports this "decision."
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, after a month of the militarization of the country, the situation for the masses is even worse than before. The Government has increased VAT from 12 to 13% leaving the possibility that the President of the Republic will make a new increase until reaching 15% when it considers it appropriate; Unemployment has increased with the closure of shops of small and medium bourgeoisie; The prices of the basic basket continue to increase day by day, as well as speculation practices in essential products in some regions of the country; And everything seems to indicate that external debt will increase while the great bourgeoisie retains intact its privileges. Meanwhile, the masses support military cateos in public transport as well as in places, schools and work centers.
 </p>
 <p>
  They are dark moments for popular masses in Ecuador. It is important to greet the first protests that are recorded in the middle of the state of exception against the economic measures of the regime, but this will not suffice. The working class and peoples must break with parliamentary cretinism and opportunism that they intend to ride these first responses as they have done so many times, trafficking with the fair struggles of the people and selling them in the parliaments of hunger for a plate of lentils.

   The figure of the internal armed conflict within international humanitarian law provides a status for recognition of a belligerent armed force, which is fundamental to protect the lives of civilians and populations, limiting war methods and operations.

   According to the laws of that country, the state of exception is declared by the President of the Republic and lasts up to 60 days being able to renew another 30 days. The plebiscite and the counter -reform could be the means by which indeterminate militarization is continued.

   Here a parenthesis can be made: it is evident that Zelensky needs more money and weapons to sustain himself in power, and this is increasing , as Hungary, they see with less interest to continue transferring war funds for Ukraine. The same goes for the US where a few months after the presidential election has jumped the republican opposition against the Biden government regarding economic and military aid towards the Ukraine government. In general, imperialism is focused at this time on the genocidal campaign of the Zionist entity against Palestine, and for such for the United States government it is cheaper - politically speaking - economically supporting this “transfer of weapons” from Ecuador to Ukraine to Ukraine, to directly send that money or those weapons to Zelensky
