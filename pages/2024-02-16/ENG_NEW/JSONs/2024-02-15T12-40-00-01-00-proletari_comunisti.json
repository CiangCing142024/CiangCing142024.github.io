This is very right in the sense that more deeply e \n more exactly than all the others the socialist theory determines the \n causes of the ailments of the working class and therefore the workers can \n assimilate it easily,\n  <i>\n   so long as\n  </i>\n  this theory not chapters \n in front of spontaneity,\n  <i>\n   so long as\n  </i>\n  we do not subject to the \n spontaneity, the working class aspires spontaneously to socialism \n but the bourgeois ideology that is the most widespread (and that constantly \n It rises in the most varied forms), however, it is imposed \n spontaneously more than any other at the worker.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  Referring to \n Journal of Economism, Rabociaja Myisl Lenin writes: \u201cDon't denial \n completely the political struggle ... speaks of the fight against the government ... \n He just thinks that politics always follows\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n the economy ... these \n thesis are absolutely false,\n <i>\n  If by politics we mean the \n social democratic policy\n </i>\n (Communist editor's note). The economic struggle \n of the workers, as we have seen, is very often linked (although not \n inextricably) to bourgeois politics ... politics \n tradunionist is the general aspiration of all workers ad \n obtain direct measures against the ailments proper to the state of the \n their condition, but not yet suitable to suppress this condition, \n that is, to destroy the submission of work to capital ... \n So, there is politics and political ... \".\n <p>\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  Economists \n \u201cBy fully recognizing the growing political struggle \n spontaneously from the same worker movement (or rather the \n claims and political aspirations of the workers) ... refuse \n Absolutely to independently elaborate a policy ... specifies \n who responds to the tasks of socialism and current conditions \", \n of the country and the class struggle.\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  Lenin continuing \n In the examination of other forms of economism, he takes in \n consideration those who give much weight to the spontaneous struggle of \n workers, who of course when he begins to wake up grabs the first \n means of struggle that happen, but clearly these first means \n They will be the tradunionists and the first ideology that happens will be \n Always bourgeois ideology \".\n </p>\n <p style=\"line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;\">\n  Lenin does not put in \n discussion this process nor \u201cthat the mass worker movement \n It is a very important phenomenon is something on which there is no discussion.
