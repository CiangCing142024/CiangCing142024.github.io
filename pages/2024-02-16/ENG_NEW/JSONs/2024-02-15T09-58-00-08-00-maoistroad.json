O \n revisionism tries to hide that the Spanish regime is the instrument of \n alliance between the Galician bourgeoisie and the Spanish bourgeoisie, in addition to \n other allied secondary social classes and strata, such as the \n clergy, from uncleshowed sectors, etc.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; visibility: visible;\">\n   <div data-adtags-width=\"750\" id=\"atatags-26942-478493\">\n   </div>\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n   A \n  political practice of revisionism always strengthens the bourgeois state \n because always keeps alive the idea that through the elections, the \n institutes and the reforms of the bourgeois state is possible, to eliminate the \n destructive character of capitalist society, or that it is possible to eliminate the \n  trend for new interimperialist wars, which is possible \n eliminate the capitalist accumulation law that determines that the increase in \n wealth of a few people implies the poverty of many other \n people in the world, or that it is possible to regulate the maximum differences between the \n  income of the bourgeoisie and the salary of the working class through taxes, \n etc.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n   Revisionism always tries to \u201csave\u201d \n  Work Class of his \u201cDesilusom\u201d in the bourgeois state. Even when the \n revisionism calls for the \u201cabsten\u00e7om\u201d always is because \u201cnengumha of the options is \n proper\". Although revisionism calls for the \u201cabsten\u00e7om\u201d, \n unconsciously wants to make it clear that you don't want to consider the state \n bourgeois like the enemy, who does not want to fight false illusions in \n reform of the bourgeois state.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n   Other revisionists will choose the same \n That other times, for keeping silent over the parliamentary scam. For \n Many is always the \"least lummy\" option. A LESS MALO THAT NEVER HAS \n end, because there is always something worse but it is the \u201cless malo\u201d in the face of the new \n even more element.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n   For revisionism the elections sound o \n eternal process of \u201caccumulation of forces\u201d. An eternal \u201caccumulation of \n forces \u201dthat never ends and that only serves to\u201c accumulate \u201dthe common sense \n of bourgeois ideology. A \u201caccumulation of forces\u201d that justifies everything \n but that does not fit nothing if we want a \"guide to A\u00e7om.\"\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n   In the current situation of the proletariat \n Galician, where there is no communist party that creates bonds that unite \n  avant -garde and the masses, any other political position different from \n boycott, means renouncing bourgeois ideology. Means \n deviate from the fair political line. Because renouncing to get out and \n to denounce the class character of the state is to contribute to spreading to \n Bourgeois ideology. So much has revisionism to speak a lot about \n unionism, anti -fascism, socialism, communism, etc., because its \n program and your practice only serve to justify some versom \n Obreirista, or postmodern, from bourgeois ideology.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-justify\">\n   DRAFPAR THE CLASS CHARACTER \n  Spanish as the political power of the Galician bourgeoisie in alliance with the \n Spanish and Polo bourgeoisie as much as, the main enemy of the people \n Galician is fundamental in the work of communist agitation. Seamless \n awareness of the class character of the Spanish regime it is impossible to have \n awareness of the social reality of the world.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n   <strong>\n    BOOTING TO ELECTORAL FARDA!\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\n   <strong>\n    Draw to the Spanish regime as the enemy of the people!\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n   <figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\">\n    <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-817\" data-attachment-id=\"817\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"Boicote eleitoral 18F\" data-large-file=\"https://galizavermelha.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/boicote-eleitoral-18f-3.jpg?w=725\" data-medium-file=\"https://galizavermelha.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/boicote-eleitoral-18f-3.jpg?w=212\" data-orig-file=\"https://galizavermelha.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/boicote-eleitoral-18f-3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2482,3508\" data-permalink=\"https://galizavermelha.wordpress.com/boicote-eleitoral-18f/\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://galizavermelha.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/boicote-eleitoral-18f-3.jpg?w=725\" srcset=\"https://galizavermelha.files.wordpress.com/2024/02/boicote-eleitoral-18f-3.jpg?w=725\" width=\"453\"/>\n   </figure>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"atatags-370373-65ce503324282\">\n  </div>\n  <div data-adtags-width=\"750\" id=\"atatags-26942-65ce503324343\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\" id=\"jp-post-flair\">\n   <br/>\n   <div class=\"entry-meta\">\n    <span class=\"byline\">\n     <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"svg-icon\" height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n     </svg>\n    </span>\n   </div>\n   <span class=\"byline\">\n    <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">\n     Posted by\n    </span>\n    <span class=\"author vcard\">\n     <a class=\"url fn n\" href=\"https://galizavermelha.wordpress.com/author/galizavermelha/\">\n      gallic\n     </a>\n    </span>\n   </span>\n   <span class=\"posted-on\">\n    <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"svg-icon\" height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n     <defs>\n     </defs>\n    </svg>\n   </span>\n   <span class=\"posted-on\">\n   </span>\n   <span class=\"posted-on\">\n    <a href=\"https://galizavermelha.wordpress.com/2024/02/09/boicote-ao-novo-circo-eleitoral-do-18-de-fevereiro/\" rel=\"bookmark\">\n     <time class=\"entry-date published updated\" datetime=\"2024-02-09T15:14:00-03:00\">\n      February 9, 2024\n     </time>\n    </a>\n   </span>\n   <span class=\"cat-links\">\n    <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"svg-icon\" height=\"16\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n    </svg>\n   </span>\n   <header class=\"entry-header responsive-max-width\">\n    <div class=\"entry-meta\">\n     <span class=\"cat-links\">\n      <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">\n       Posted in\n      </span>\n      <a href=\"https://galizavermelha.wordpress.com/category/galiza/\" rel=\"category tag\">\n       Galicia\n      </a>\n      ,\n      <a href=\"https://galizavermelha.wordpress.com/category/galiza-vermelha/\" rel=\"category tag\">\n       Red Galicia\n      </a>\n      ,\n      <a href=\"https://galizavermelha.wordpress.com/category/mlm/\" rel=\"category tag\">\n       mlm\n      </a>\n     </span>\n    </div>\n   </header>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "In each new \u201cfeast of democracy\u201d, revisionism tries to convince the Galician proletariat that the Spanish regime is an instrument ...", "author": ["maoistroad"], "source": "https://maoistroad.blogspot.com/2024/02/galiza-boicote-ao-novo-circo-eleitoral.html"}
