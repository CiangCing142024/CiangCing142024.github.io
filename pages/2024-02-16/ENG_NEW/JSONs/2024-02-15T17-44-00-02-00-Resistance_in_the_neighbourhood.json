Breeders, farmers, beekeepers, the whole of the poor and medium -sized peasantry are struggling for their survival. Floods and disasters, prices of their products that are mismatches with production costs and anti -rational policies constantly squeeze farmers' income down. The government announcements and crumbs that the prime minister put in his meeting with them cannot equalize the disaster that thousands of rural households have suffered. Everything shows that these constantly thickens are not for the \"price of weapons\". There are mobilizations that result from the accumulated indignation of the peasantry. The same indignation is expressed by the farmers of the whole of Europe who are on the road with common problems and joint claims.\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n  <img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"2424\" data-original-width=\"2480\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8YlZxNmMdiU3VCMPVaqp4IyAe_NeKETSShly72b0C-VMqvJ3AG6114h_zxiSLHwePqvj1bWpp5-fvUBWNsfXCfaHUDXaZphUIPLrkQBBZGCV4IDsJVvw-34CelL-355zWNsl6XK5t_3yVMrtcG51xwReMg8ygJ9I3bBbSc8NX0229G8d7zjh0cnHDjMT8/w640-h626/%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%82-%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%B1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8YlZxNmMdiU3VCMPVaqp4IyAe_NeKETSShly72b0C-VMqvJ3AG6114h_zxiSLHwePqvj1bWpp5-fvUBWNsfXCfaHUDXaZphUIPLrkQBBZGCV4IDsJVvw-34CelL-355zWNsl6XK5t_3yVMrtcG51xwReMg8ygJ9I3bBbSc8NX0229G8d7zjh0cnHDjMT8/w640-h626/%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%82-%CE%B1%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%B1.jpg\" width=\"640\"/>\n </div>\n <span>\n  <a name=\"more\">\n  </a>\n </span>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  <br/>\n </div>\n <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n  We students who have resolved in a racing orbit must jointly build a common front of resistance with the peasantry and the people to overthrow the policy that is moving a new hit of our rights.
