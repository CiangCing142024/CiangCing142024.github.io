They saw the \n their chains, they demolished the cage and saut\u00e9ed the walls of \n  iron. The Palestinians took flight. They blinded the cameras, \n  Communications and penetrated the settlements interrupted. They have \n paralyzed a colony of nuclear colonists and have brought to their knees \n The Empire. They cut the umbilical cord of inexpression, of the \n  safety and sacrosanct domain, vital for all projects \n colonial.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Immediately, imperial scribes and politicians, settlers and administrators \n colonial, conservative and liberal - especially liberals - are \n put at work. Their task was twofold: to ensure that the world \n saw natives as wild hordes, barbarians, animals, quintessence \n del evil - Here the liberals quickly forgot theirs \n political correctness and havetened to condemn - and \n at the same time restore the domain.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The first stormed the world, but for anyone who was healthy to \n mind has always been fallacious and now it has been tirelessly and \n completely dispelled. The second, however, has permeated the mind of \n Many, even those potentially well intentioned. This \n restoration of the empire has manifested themselves in several ways: the Palestinians \n they could not have escaped alone, they would not have been able to penetrate \n  there\n  <span>\n  </span>\n  Iron dome, Israeli security systems are too much \n advanced to be overcome or unarmed - Israel \u201chas let it \n they did. \"\n </p>\n <p>\n  Without losing a blow, an unprecedented operation that shattered the concept of imperial invincibility\n  <em>\n   has been reformulated as an imperial tool\n  </em>\n  . \n  It was part of a plan\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <a name=\"more\">\n </a>\n wider general to strengthen and expand \n  further the domain: the natives were senseless pawns \n provision of an omniscient colonial power and intellectually \n supreme. From this vein of thought - and in it - many emerged \n Other truths, half truths and lies that highlight and consolidate it \n the socket. According to some, Israel had actually supported and created \n Hamas. Netanyahu had planned all this to win the next \n Elections, support others. And my favorite - especially because it is now \n  been enriched by the Zionist stenographers of\n <em>\n  New York Times\n </em>\n - \"Israel had always knew.\"\n <span>\n </span>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Surely, the next discovery will be that Israel knew of the flood \n  of Al-Aqsa before the Palestinians themselves, who invented it, has it \n Presented in Hamas and inculcated it in the minds of the Palestinians. At the \n basis of all this - and to constitute the raison d'etre collective \n These theories - there is the unthinkability of the slave revolt (or gods \n natives).\n </p>\n <span id=\"more-26848\">\n </span>\n <p>\n  The unthinkability of the slave revolt is a concept introduced \n by Michel-Rolph Trouillot to explain the answers, silences and the \n silence of the western empire on the Haitian revolution. While \n Trouillot uses it in relation to the 18th century imperialists, this \n  unthinkability is applied without interruption to the present: \n the empire, its ideologies, its colonialism, its genocides and the \n His colonies are not stories to study, but material realities and violence \n lived. Today.\n </p>\n <p>\n  At the outbreak of the Haitian revolution, the most common reaction in \n France, England, Spain and the United States was disbelief. The news \n It was false. The facts-just like those of the Al-Aqsa flood- \n They were too improbable. In any case, the facts had to be false, \n Because blacks, like the Palestinians, were beasts without brain, wild \n  forced to docility, lazy, disorganized and lower: they were \n absolutely unable to devise such an operation, much less than \n  organize and make it.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-image\">\n  <img alt=\"\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Frontispiece-from-LIncendie-du-Cap-ou-Le-regne-de-Toussaint-Louverture-by-Rene-Perin-1802.jpg?w=648&amp;ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/mondoweiss.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Frontispiece-from-LIncendie-du-Cap-ou-Le-regne-de-Toussaint-Louverture-by-Rene-Perin-1802.jpg?w=648&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"540\"/>\n  <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n   <i>\n    This \n  title page of the novel of 1802, \"'' Incandie du cap, ou le r\u00e8gne de \n Toussaint-Louverture \u201dof the French novelist Ren\u00e9 P\u00e9rin, has become \n one of the most recognizable representations of the Haitian revolution, \n  used as a propaganda that delegated the revolution and attacked \n  His leader, Toussaint Louverture, which P\u00e9rin described as a \"Negro \n  atrocious \u201dof which he wanted to\u201c offer a portrait on which, reader, \n You may be forced to pay many tears !!! \" Illustration \n It depicts a well-dressed toussoint-eLuverture that presides over the ruthless \n  massacre of innocent whites, many of which are women and children.

The problem, however, was \n just that the West was reacting - to the fact that occurred - and \n devising explanations, while the blacks and the Palestinians implemented \n  the unthinkable, actively neutralize the colonial forces and \n claimed the lands.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Slowly and reluctantly, the reality of the operations made its way. \n  The news of ruthless black hordes that massacred the whites reached \n Europe, and the Zionists proclaimed the \"horrors of San \n Domingo \". The news therefore had to be rationalized in one way \n Different: the obvious facts were, they are still unthinkable. Therefore, the \n revolution was \u201can unfortunate repercussion of the calculation errors of the \n  farmers \", the flood of Al-Aqsa was the result of\" A waterfall of \n  False years duration of years \u201dof Israel,\u201c did not aim at a change \n revolutionary \u201d, did not aim at decolonization,\u201c it was not \n supported by the majority of the slave population \u201d, was Hamas \n who acted alone and the Palestinians did not support them, \u201cit is due \n to external agitators, \"Iran instigated,\" was the ... consequence of \n various connive conspiracy by non -slaves \u201d, there have been \n \u201cFugs of news within the security establishment of security \n Israeli\". With blacks and Palestinians intellectually null, \u201ceach \n party has chosen his favorite enemy as the conspirator plus \n probable ... [and] he accused himself of being the mind behind the \n revolt\". The British, the realists and the mules were in Haiti; in \n Palestine, Iran was the mind, and behind them, Russia and China.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Here, some will probably rush to throw insults or ad \n accuse me of naivety for neglecting the clear facts (as if \n I was the empire) of Zionist knowledge. I will clarify. None of this \n that I wrote is to say that the Zionist regime certainly does not \n he knew - even if my visceral instinct still hesitates to believe that \n he knew - but rather that the operation was unthinkable for them, that \n  their knowledge/not knowing is irrelevant, and that the development of \n events and their results are not in their omnipotent hands, but in those \n  of the Palestinians, of the owners of the earth and resistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is interesting to note that, among all the work of tachigraphy \n imperial presented in the Times survey on the Al-Aqsa flood, \n There is a line that has been neglected and underestimated especially in \n effort to bomb the revolutionary successes of 7 October in the Kingdom \n of the Empirium, under siege, or rather, without memory.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It can therefore be deduced that this sentence has a potential truth:\n </p>\n <p>\n  \u201c[Israel kept the] fatally inaccurate conviction that Hamas \n He did not have the ability to attack and would not have dared to do it ... [one] \n conviction thus rooted in the Israeli government ... to ignore the \n growing evidence of the opposite \".\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note the perception of Palestinian inability - and docility \n through fear - as well as the recognition that an operation of \n genre was so viscerally unthinkable that the Zionists, like the \n Europeans of 1792, they have disavowed their own eyes. Such is \n The arrogance of the empire, and here is its destruction.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Imperialism is based on the idea itself, on the centrality and \n supremacy of the ego on those who await the conquest and the \n civilization. The primarity of the empire rests on secondary \n of the other. Imperial superiority is based on native inferiority. \n Yet, paradoxically, this secondary and inferiority are \n indispensable to the primarity and superiority of the European and the Empire. \n  Events such as the Haitian revolution, the attack on the Milk Bar e \n The flood of Al-Aqsa, invert, overturn or shatter completely \n These hierarchies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore, for the native, this violence is a \"purifying force\", \n frees him \u201cfrom his inferiority complex, from his despair and \n inertia; It makes it fearless and restores self -respect. To do this, \n If the native frees itself from its inferiority complex, it is no longer \n inferior; If it is no longer lower, the colonizer is not higher; self \n The colonizer is not superior, then the idea of empire comes \n Compromise, the idols collapse and imperialism falls.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Therefore\n  <b>\n   , writes Fanon, \u201cit is precisely when he [the \n native] realizes his humanity that begins to sharpen the weapons with which \n  The victory will ensure. \"\n  </b>\n  The function of rationalizing theories \n which clarify the unthinkable then becomes evident: it is the \n preservation of the domain, of the hierarchy, the future of the colonists, the \n imperial self.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The threat posed by any act of indigenous resistance in \n Any part of the colonized world is not simply a threat \n material for its direct objective or for the local lordship, but a \n existential scourge against empire and imperialism in his \n complex. In the always relevant words of Ghassan Kanafani, \n \"Imperialism has placed its body in the world, her head in Asia \n Eastern, the heart in the Middle East, its arteries reach \n Africa and Latin America. Wherever you hit him, damn him and serve the \n  World Revolution \".\n </p>\n <p>\n  I have to conclude with an explanation. The idea for this piece is to me \n came for the first time on October 7th. Since then I have thought of \n Writing it, but I found myself blocked by the devastation of the genocide. \n  How can I write about something in addition to the genocide? In fact, while \n You are reading this piece, a Palestinian child - the soul of the soul \n  of someone - he was assassinated to Gaza. Every 7 minutes. As i \n  days were transformed into months, thinking, talking or writing about \n anything else seemed more and more inappropriate, even \n immoral. After an endless debate, I remembered the scheme \n of colonial history: after an act of resistance of the natives it arrives the \n More ferocious and unbridled brutality than the colony of settlers. It is designed \n To teach a lesson, to make his triumphs forget - native - \n  however small - in order to swallow it in the fire and drown it in \n blood until it consumes it. It cannot be afforded that this cancellation \n  And conquest remain unchallenged.\n </p>\n <p>\n  While we look at the press agencies, politicians, ideologists and \n  spectators to explain an unprecedented situation, depriving the \n Palestinians of free will - and of humanity - we must recognize \n The hygiene, civil and trivializing gear of the machine \n  imperial at stake. While the bombs fall on Gaza, trying to \n cancel the memory of the Palestinians of their victory, to bury \n  under the rubble their glimmer of liberation and to delete from \n world the memory of their presence,\n  <b>\n   we must not forget. 7 \n October, Palestine has overturned the imperial world order and today, or \n  Tomorrow, in ten or one hundred years, it will be free.\n  </b>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Translation by Grazia Parolari \"All sentient beings are morally the same\" - Invictapapalestina.org\n </p>\n <p>\n  <i>\n   Taken from Pungolo Rosso\n  </i>\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "An interesting article that must first of all be read positions of leftist subjects and opportunists, present in the sedic formations ...", "author": ["maoist"], "source": "https://proletaricomunisti.blogspot.com/2024/02/pc-15-febbraio-proposito-del-7-ottobre.html"}
