<p>
  By a commentator for the Earn Folket Media.
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>
<p>
<strong>
   Farmers in several European countries have gone out on the streets of headquarters and big cities. Farmers object to increased costs and strict regulations that threaten their basis of life.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  In France, Romania, Hungary, Greece and Italy, farmers have driven with tractors into the big cities and created blockage. In France, protesters have driven with tractors into several cities, including the capital Paris, emptied agricultural waste and cow dung in front of parliament and town hall, and blocked large streets with straw balls. In addition, there have been physical fighting against police, including where French farmers fired fireworks at the police.
 </p>
<p>
  The protests in France began on January 16 with a demonstration in the city of Toulouse. The farmers then decided to block the highway A64 on January 18, and the movement expanded from there to the big cities.
 </p>
<p>
  On January 22, the protests spread to other countries, and Polish farmers and truck drivers blocked the border crossings, leading to queue formation. On January 23, a woman was killed, and her husband and daughter injured in a traffic collision by a barricade when a car plowed into a barricade made of straw balls.
 </p>
<p>
  Renaud Foucart, an associate professor at Lancaster University in England, points to the European "Green Deal", in Norwegian: "The Green Change", as an important source of tension.
 </p>
<p>
  Many of the farmers protest due to real decline in the state's support. Huge costs have incurred agriculture throughout Europe after the crisis in 2020, the price increases and the war in Ukraine. New stricter regulations of pesticides and other chemicals also lead to farmers earning less, especially in competition with countries that have minor regulations on agriculture.
 </p>
<p>
  French farmers in particular seem to feel unfairly treated in relation to other farmers in the EU. For example, Italian farmers do not have as many regulations as French farmers. Such conditions combined with cuts in the pension schemes have created anger in many farmers.
 </p>
<p>
  Foucart also points out that each country has its own concerns: “In Germany, diesel was in particular that was the focus, and diesel was being taxed to tractors. In the Netherlands, there was a specific problem taxation of nitrogen, which affects the industrial production of pig and chicken. Poland is a very interesting case because the country has been in the brink of military support for Ukraine, but at the same time the Polish farmers are very angry and block the border to ensure that Ukrainian grain does not enter Poland. "
 </p>
<p>
  In short, European farmers are distinguished in particular to increase profits for financial capital and cut the expenses of the old states in the face of the general crisis in imperialism. This not only increases the exploitation of the masses in Europe, but also by the oppressed nations, and especially poor farmers and mediums in these. The attacks meet with struggle and resistance from the farmers, which is a natural ally of the working class, with a common enemy in the bourgeois states and monopoly citizenship.

           A loud demonstration moved through Vienna on the evening of February 12, the 90th anniversary of the heroic February fights in 1934. The Karl-Marx-Hof, then a central location of the resistance, became the place of memory of those fighters who are rightly called heroes.

           Exactly 90 years ago, cannon fire thundered in the Karl-Marx-Hof when the workers' houses inhabited by the Austrofascist Bundesheer took fire. In many parts of Austria, thousands rose in the February days with the weapon in hand against Austrofascism. Despite the military defeat, these fights were crucial for the further development of the resistance struggle against Austrofascism and later against the occupation by the Nazis. The demonstration on the anniversary was largely combative: transparent, flags, slogans, march and pyrotechnics ensured that the topicality of the teachings of this struggle was demonstrated 90 years later.

           The joint solution of the demonstration was "memory of fighting". This was also expressed in the speech choirs and content of the demonstration, which was directed against the current democracy and social reduction, as well as the increasing prohibition policy. Sliding against inflations and wage robbery alternated with calls against upgrade, against NATO and for the defense of Austrian neutrality. Palestinian flags could also be seen, as a symbolic expression of international solidarity and friendship, but also against the censorship and judicial justice of the rulers in relation to the Palestine solidarity.

           What was striking was a red block on the demonstration, which has a significant impact on the speech choirs. This block particularly emphasized the importance of the then revolutionary KPÖ, which stood against the retirement policy of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAPÖ), today's SPÖ. This is also important in this respect, since on this 90th anniversary the leadership team of social democracy tries to stage itself as the "party of February fights". However, those who fought and died in the bloody days of February, however, stood against the line of social democratic party leadership.

           The combative atmosphere on the demonstration showed that the participants did not expect that the rulers will "come to reason today". On the contrary, the slogan spread

<span>
            "The February fights already showed - fight for the revolution!"

  A little over a month of the state of exception and the declaration of the "internal armed conflict", where President Daniel Noboa recognized drug trafficking groups [1] in a belligerent force [1], the situation in that country evokes the period of the military dictatorship of 1963 until 1984, which was clearly a terrorist dictatorship of the great capital against the people.
 </p>
<p>
  Things today are nothing different, and the pure declaration seems like a hoax in the terms that correctly characterizes the Communist Party of Ecuador-Sol Red
  <em>
   … “This declaration of internal conflict lacks the most elementary foundations that govern this scenario. • The bands do not pursue political objectives. • They have no political direction. • They do not have disciplined armed forces. • They do not control territories. • They have shown not willing to observe international war law. Under these premises, in Ecuador there is no internal war, there is no politically structured belligerent force, therefore, Noboa's statements and decisions are a hoax. ”
  </em>

 </p>
<p>
  Some people think that it is the model-bukele applied in another country, but they remain in the media or "spectacular" part of the matter that seeks to distract the attention of the masses with news about mass arrests [most of them arbitrarily Innocent people], the "recovery of the State Rectory" on prisons, the construction of new high security prisons, and the state of siege with military and police combing the streets and towns of the whole country aboard patrols, vehicles, vehicles Artillery, firefighters, ambulances, etc. Reality goes beyond this and in fact it must be understood as an administrative and military self-golpe that undermines the political freedoms and fundamental rights of the workers and peoples of Ecuador under the pretext of fighting the "narco-terrorism" .

  Throughout this first month there are at least 80 thousand operations led by the Army where around 6 thousand people have arrested, 237 of them allegedly related to "terrorism." In all these arrests there is no clarity about the criminal proceedings, there is also no record of made available, links to the process or liberations, that is: there is no legal certainty or guarantees to due process for detained persons, which can result at risk of forced disappearances. In addition, some press monopolies speak of 10 people killed per day, most of them in the midst of clashes with security forces, which could be false positives.
 </p>
<p>
  Now Noboa issues two new decrees where he calls a "plebiscite" on security matters (read the continuity of the militarization of the country [3]) and counter -reforms to the Constitution. Do not lose sight of the fact that next year there will be federal elections and will surely seek its re-election to continue the plan of the reaction with wide-colored-olive manga.
 </p>
<p>
  Indeed, it is the fascistization of the old Ecuadorian state controlled by landowners and great bourgeois, which today again reaffirmed their subordination against Yankee imperialism by contending with other countries in the region to see who installs the largest and most efficient gringa military base in South America.
 </p>
<p>
  In recent weeks and in the midst of the state of exception, high commanders of the American army and government have arrived in the country to provide their "support" to the Ecuadorian government, offering training, advice and financing. Precisely in that sense, the Government sells-Patrias of Daniel Noboa confirmed that he will seek more funds for his crusade and announced the delivery of military weapons and equipment of Soviet origin to the fascist government of Ukraine to support him in the war against Russia.

  Noboa had described as "scrap" this war material for which he will receive new military team for a value of up to 200 million dollars from the US imperialist government the idea of getting rid of the “obsolete” military team and receiving in Change new team of gringa technology is very good to fulfill the orders of their gringos masters: deepen the militarization of the country and reinforce its semi -colonial rivets as part of the counterinsurgent strategy. Therefore, the representative of Yankee imperialism in South America, Kevin Sullivan, has not been able to deny the joy of the government of Joe Biden who economically supports this "decision."
 </p>
<p>
  Today, after a month of the militarization of the country, the situation for the masses is even worse than before. The Government has increased VAT from 12 to 13% leaving the possibility that the President of the Republic will make a new increase until reaching 15% when it considers it appropriate; Unemployment has increased with the closure of shops of small and medium bourgeoisie; The prices of the basic basket continue to increase day by day, as well as speculation practices in essential products in some regions of the country; And everything seems to indicate that external debt will increase while the great bourgeoisie retains intact its privileges. Meanwhile, the masses support military cateos in public transport as well as in places, schools and work centers.
 </p>
<p>
  They are dark moments for popular masses in Ecuador. It is important to greet the first protests that are recorded in the middle of the state of exception against the economic measures of the regime, but this will not suffice. The working class and peoples must break with parliamentary cretinism and opportunism that they intend to ride these first responses as they have done so many times, trafficking with the fair struggles of the people and selling them in the parliaments of hunger for a plate of lentils.

   Here a parenthesis can be made: it is evident that Zelensky needs more money and weapons to sustain himself in power, and this is increasing , as Hungary, they see with less interest to continue transferring war funds for Ukraine. The same goes for the US where a few months after the presidential election has jumped the republican opposition against the Biden government regarding economic and military aid towards the Ukraine government. In general, imperialism is focused at this time on the genocidal campaign of the Zionist entity against Palestine, and for such for the United States government it is cheaper - politically speaking - economically supporting this “transfer of weapons” from Ecuador to Ukraine to Ukraine, to directly send that money or those weapons to Zelensky

     During the night of Sunday, 11 to Monday, February 12, the steps of 
 The staircase on rue Sainte Marie des Terreaux, in Lyon, were 
 repainted in the colors of Palestine, to visibility the horror of 
 genocide practiced by the Israeli occupation army. Six activists 
 were taken to the fact and put into police custody and three underwent 
 immediate searches (which is illegal, because the rules of 
  police custody normally do not apply to this kind of offense). A 
 ministerial directive is also applied: each action 
 concerning Palestine must lead, as much as possible, to a guard 
  seen, in order to intimidate.

    Farmers have started their "Delhi Chalo" march 
 (Come to Delhi) Tuesday morning, aboard trucks and loaded trolleys 
 food, bedding and other supplies, after the 
 negotiations with the government have not resulted in a commitment on 
  Minimum prices for a whole series of cultures. The authorities have 
 taken strict safety measures in the neighboring areas of New 
 Delhi. Hundreds of police officers were deployed 
  In the middle of cement blocks surmounted by barbed wire and 
 containers intended to block the road to convoy. Security forces 
 arrested farmers on the border of Shambhu, who separates the 
 Pendjab and Haryana - the northern states to which the 
 Most farmers - almost 200 km from their destination.
   </p>
<p>
    The demonstrators threw stones and tried to break the 
 barricades, police and paramilitary forces have used 
 tear gas and water cannons. Security forces have 
 also used drones to drop tear gas grenades on 
 farmers who, in response, have launched kite in the 
 Heaven in the hope of tangling the machines. Several unions 
 of farmers said they would protest against the action of the 
 Police by blocking rail traffic in several places in Pendjab 
  For four hours Thursday.

   In each new “feast of democracy” 
 revisionism tries to convince the Galician proletariat that the regime 
 Spanish is a neutral instrument, which is not the enemy of the Galician people. O 
 revisionism tries to hide that the Spanish regime is the instrument of 
 alliance between the Galician bourgeoisie and the Spanish bourgeoisie, in addition to 
 other allied secondary social classes and strata, such as the 
 clergy, from uncleshowed sectors, etc.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   A 
  political practice of revisionism always strengthens the bourgeois state 
 because always keeps alive the idea that through the elections, the 
 institutes and the reforms of the bourgeois state is possible, to eliminate the 
 destructive character of capitalist society, or that it is possible to eliminate the 
  trend for new interimperialist wars, which is possible 
 eliminate the capitalist accumulation law that determines that the increase in 
 wealth of a few people implies the poverty of many other 
 people in the world, or that it is possible to regulate the maximum differences between the 
  income of the bourgeoisie and the salary of the working class through taxes, 
 etc.
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Revisionism always tries to “save” 
  Work Class of his “Desilusom” in the bourgeois state. Even when the 
 revisionism calls for the “abstençom” always is because “nengumha of the options is 
 proper". Although revisionism calls for the “abstençom”, 
 unconsciously wants to make it clear that you don't want to consider the state 
 bourgeois like the enemy, who does not want to fight false illusions in 
 reform of the bourgeois state.
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   Other revisionists will choose the same 
 That other times, for keeping silent over the parliamentary scam. For 
 Many is always the "least lummy" option. A LESS MALO THAT NEVER HAS 
 end, because there is always something worse but it is the “less malo” in the face of the new 
 even more element.
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   For revisionism the elections sound o 
 eternal process of “accumulation of forces”. An eternal “accumulation of 
 forces ”that never ends and that only serves to“ accumulate ”the common sense 
 of bourgeois ideology. A “accumulation of forces” that justifies everything 
 but that does not fit nothing if we want a "guide to Açom."
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   In the current situation of the proletariat 
 Galician, where there is no communist party that creates bonds that unite 
  avant -garde and the masses, any other political position different from 
 boycott, means renouncing bourgeois ideology. Means 
 deviate from the fair political line. Because renouncing to get out and 
 to denounce the class character of the state is to contribute to spreading to 
 Bourgeois ideology. So much has revisionism to speak a lot about 
 unionism, anti -fascism, socialism, communism, etc., because its 
 program and your practice only serve to justify some versom 
 Obreirista, or postmodern, from bourgeois ideology.
  </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
   DRAFPAR THE CLASS CHARACTER 
  Spanish as the political power of the Galician bourgeoisie in alliance with the 
 Spanish and Polo bourgeoisie as much as, the main enemy of the people 
 Galician is fundamental in the work of communist agitation. Seamless 
 awareness of the class character of the Spanish regime it is impossible to have 
 awareness of the social reality of the world.

    Why do we publish steps of this illuminating Marx manuscript on the "alienated work"? Because today (but unfortunately for several years - but the causes cannot be the subject of this text) there is a reversal
   </span>
</b>
<b>
<span>
    , even in the consciousness of many workers and workers,
   </span>
</b>
<b>
<span>
    of the relationship between one's work and private capitalist purposes of production, between manufacturers of value, of social wealth and appropriates of this wealth; There is a modern "alienation"; so, paraphrasing a phrase by Marx,
   </span>
</b>
<b>
   The worker "feels free only in its animal functions, such as eating, drinking, procrear, and at most still living a house and dressing; and instead you feel nothing more than a beast in its functions human "; He feels man when he does activity for himself who would also do an animal and feels an animal when he does a production activity, creative, social.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   So, as Marx writes: "What is animal becomes human, and what is human becomes animal".

<span>
    (steps from)
   </span>
<span>
    Alienated work
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p>
  [XXII] ... we have shown that the worker decays for goods, to the most miserable of goods, that
  <b>
   The misery of the worker lies in reverse relationship with the power and quantity of his production
  </b>
  , that the necessary result of the competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands, and therefore the most terrible reconstitution of the monopoly, which finally disappears the difference between capitalist and land owner, as the difference between the farmer and the factory worker disappears,
  <b>
   and all whole the company must split in the two classes of the owners and workers without
  </b>
<b>
   property
  </b>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The political economy starts from the fact of private property. But he does not explain it ... the political economy does not give us any explanation on the foundation of the division of capital and work, of capital and earth. When, for example, it determines the relationship of the salary with the profit of capital,
  <b>
   The interest of the capitalist applies to it as the supreme reason
  </b>
  ; that is, it presupposes what must explain ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... now we must understand the essential connection that runs between private property, the greed of money, the separation between work, capital and land ownership, between exchange and competition, enhancement and devaluation of man, between monopoly and competition , etc., the connection of all this outsuit process with the monetary system ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... we start from a fact of the political economy,
  <b>
   from a present.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   The worker becomes all the more poor the greater the wealth it produces, the more its production grows with power and extension. The worker becomes a much more cowardly commodity
   <span>
</span>
</b>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
<b>
  the bigger the amount of goods it produces is
 </b>
 .
 <b>
  The devaluation of the human world grows in direct relationship with the enhancement of the world of things. The work does not only produce goods; produces itself and the worker like a goods,
 </b>
 And precisely in the same proportion in which he generally produces goods.
 <p>
</p>
<p>
  This fact expresses nothing more than this: the object that the work produces, the product of the work, is opposed to it as a foreign being, as one
  <b>
   Power independent of the one who produces it.
  </b>
  The product of work is the work that has been fixed in an object, it has become one thing, it is the objectification of the work. The realization of the work is its objectification.
  <b>
   This realization of the work appears in the stadium of the private economy as a cancellation of the worker,
  </b>
  Objectiveness appears as loss and enslavement of the object, appropriation as an estrangement, as alienation.
 </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  The realization of the work presents itself as a cancellation in this way that the worker is canceled to die of hunger. The objectification presents itself as the loss of the object in such a way that the worker is robbed of the most necessary objects not only for life, but also for work. Yes, the work itself becomes an object ... as much more objects the worker produces, much less he can possess it and the more it ends up under the lordship of his product, of capital ...
 </p>
<p>
  ..
  <b>
   The more the worker is consumed in the work, the more powerful the foreign, objective world becomes that he creates before,
  </b>
  The more poor he becomes himself, much less his internal world belongs to him. The same happens in religion. How many more things transfers to God, much less he considers it in himself.
  <b>
   The worker puts his life in the object; But from now on his life no longer belongs to him, but to the object.
  </b>
  The bigger, therefore, this activity is, the more the worker is free of object.
  <b>
   What is the product of his work is not himself
  </b>
  . The bigger, therefore, this product is, the smaller it is himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his work becomes an object, something that exists outside, but that it exists outside of him, independent of him, unrelated to him, and becomes in front of him one power by itself;
  <b>
   It means that the life he has given to the object is opposed hostile and foreign to him.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  [XXIII] And now we consider the objectification, the production of the worker more closely, and in it the estrangement, there loss of the object, of its product.
 </p>
<p>
  The worker cannot produce anything without nature, without the external sensitive world. This is the subject on which his work is realized, on which his work acts, from which and by means of which it produces.
 </p>
<p>
  But how nature provides the work of subsistence, in the sense that work cannot exist without objects to apply; Thus, on the other hand, it also provides the means of subsistence in the narrower sense, that is, the means for the physical support of the same worker.
 </p>
<p>
  So the more the worker appropriates with his work of the external world, of sensitive nature, the more he deprives himself of the means of subsistence in the following double direction: first of all, for the fact that the external world ceases more and more to be a object belonging to his work, a means of existence of his work, and then for the fact that the external world itself ceases more and more to be a means of existence in the immediate sense, that is, a means for its physical sustenance. In this double direction, therefore,
  <b>
   The worker becomes a slave to his object: in the first place, because he receives an object to work, that is, he receives a job; Secondly, because it receives means of sustenance.
  </b>
  And therefore, in the first place because it can exist as a worker, and secondly because it can exist as a physical subject.
  <b>
   The full of this enslavement occurs when he can be maintained as a physical subject only as he is a worker and is a worker only as he is a physical person.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  (According to the laws of the political economy, the estrangement of the worker in his object is expressed in the fact that the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; how much more value produces, both less value and less dignity, he possesses; The more beautiful its product is, the more the worker becomes deformed; the more refined his object, the more he abbaries; the more powerful the work, the more he becomes helpless; the more the work is spiritual, so much The more he became material and slave of nature) ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... Of course, work produces for the rich wonderful things; But for workers it only produces deprivations. It produces buildings, but for the spelonche worker. It produces beauty, but for the deformity worker. It replaces the work with machines, but a part of the workers in a barbaric work falls and transforms the other part into the car. It produces things of the spirit, but for the idiotic worker and cretinism.
 </p>
<p>
  The immediate relationship between work and its products is the relationship between the worker and the objects of his production. The relationship that the rich has with the objects of production and with the same production is only a consequence of that first relationship ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... estrangement is shown not only in the result, but also in the ego of production, within the same production activity. How could the worker make himself foreign in the product of his activity, if he did not estrange himself from himself in the act of production? The product is nothing more than the "resumé" of the activity, of production. So,
  <b>
   If the product of the work is alienation, the production itself must be an active alienation
  </b>
  ...
 </p>
<p>
  And now, what does work alienation consist of?
 </p>
<p>
  It consists first of all in the fact that
  <b>
   The work is external to the worker, that is, he does not belong to his being, and therefore in his work he does not affirm himself, but is denied,
  </b>
  He feels not satisfied, but unhappy, does not develop free physical and spiritual energy, but brush his body and destroys his spirit.
  <b>
   Therefore the worker only outside the work he feels near himself; And he feels out of himself in the work.
  </b>
  And at home if he does not work; And if he works he is not at home. His work is therefore not voluntary, but forced, it is a forced job. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need, but only a means of satisfying foreign needs. Its extraneousness is clearly revealed in the fact that as soon as the physical compulsion or any other compulsion is less, the work is fled like the plague.
  <b>
   External work, the work in which man is alienated, is a work of sacrifice of oneself, of mortification.
  </b>
  Finally, the exterior of work for the worker appears in what
  <b>
   The work is not its own, but it is of another. It does not belong to him, and he, in the work, does not belong to himself, but to another
  </b>
  . As in religion, the activity proper to human fantasy, human brain and human heart affects the individual regardless of the individual, as a foreign, divine or diabolical activity, so the activity of the worker is not his own activity. It belongs to another; It is self -loss.
 </p>
<p>
  It therefore comes as a consequence that
  <b>
   The man (the worker) feels free only in his animal functions, such as eating, drinking, procrear, and at most still living a house and dressing; Instead, you feel nothing more than a beast in its human functions. What is animal becomes human, and what is human becomes animal.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Certainly eating, drinking and procreating are also frankly human functions. But in that abstraction, which separates them from the remaining circle of human activity and makes them become ultimate and unique purposes, they are animal functions.
 </p>
<p>
  We have considered the act of the extremation of the practical activity of man, that is, the work, from two sides. 1) The relationship of the worker with the product of the work considered as a foreign and oppressive object ... 2) the relationship of work with the act of production within the work ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... [XXIV] Now we still have to derive from the two determinations described a third determination of estranged work so far.
 </p>
<p>
  Man is a being belonging to a species not only because of the species, both of one's own and that of other things, it theoretically and practically its object, but also (and it is only a different expression for the same thing) Because it behaves towards itself as towards the present and living species, because it behaves towards itself as towards a universal and therefore free being ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... the animal is immediately one with its vital activity. It is not distinguished from it. And that same. The man makes his vital activity the same object of his will and consciousness. It has a conscious vital activity. There is no determined sphere in which the man immediately confuses himself. The vital conscious activity of man distinguishes man immediately from the vital activity of the animal. Just for this reason he is a being belonging to a species. Or rather he is a conscious being, that is, his own life is his object, just because he is a being belonging to a species. Only therefore its activity is a free activity. The foreign work overturns the relationship as the man, precisely because it is a conscious being, makes his vital activity, of his essence only a means for his existence.
 </p>
<p>
  The practical creation of an objective world, the transformation of inorganic nature is the proof that man is a being belonging to a species and endowed with consciousness, that is, it is a being who behaves towards the species as towards his own being, or towards himself as a being belonging to a species. Certainly the animal also produces. A nest is made, homes, as bees, beavers, ants, etc. do. Except that the animal produces only what it needs immediately for itself or for its born; It produces unilaterally, while man produces universally; It produces only under the empire of immediate physical need, while man also produces free from physical need, and truly produces only when it is free from it; The animal only reproduces itself, while man reproduces the entire nature; The animal product immediately belongs to its physical body, while man freely puts himself in front of his product. The animal only builds according to the measure and the need for the species, to which it belongs, while man knows how to produce according to the measure of all kinds and knows everywhere to prepare the measure inherent to that certain object; So man also builds according to the laws of beauty.
 </p>
<p>
  Just only
  <b>
   In the transformation of the objective world, man therefore really shows himself as a being belonging to a species
  </b>
  . This production is his active life as being belonging to a species. Through it, nature appears as its work and its reality. The object of work is therefore the objectification of man's life as being belonging to a species, as he doubles himself, not only as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, really, and therefore looks at a world from it created.
  <b>
   Therefore the work estranged by snatching the object of his production from man, he tears his life of being belonging to a species,
  </b>
  its specific real objectivity
  <b>
   and changes its primacy in the face of animals
  </b>
  In the disadvantage consisting in the fact that his inorganic body, nature, is subtracted.
 </p>
<p>
  Equally,
  <b>
   The work estranged by degrading autonomous activity by means, free activity, makes man's life as being belonging to a species a means of his physical existence.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  By the work of alienation, the consciousness, which man has of his species, therefore transforms into what his life of being that belongs to a species becomes for him a means.
 </p>
<p>
  Alienated work therefore does:
 </p>
<p>
  3) of the being of man, as being belonging to a species, both of nature and of his specific spiritual ability, a being foreign to him, a means of his individual existence. It makes man foreign his own body, both external nature, as his spiritual being, his human being.
 </p>
<p>
  4) An immediate consequence of the fact that man is made foreign to the product of his work, of his vital activity, to his generic being, is the estrangement of man from man. If man opposes himself, the other man opposes him. What is worth of the relationship of man with his work, with the product of his work and with himself, is worth the relationship of man with the other man, and also with the work and the object of the work of the other man. ..
 </p>
<p>
  ... therefore in the relationship of foreign work every man considers the others according to the criterion and the relationship in which he himself is as a worker.
 </p>
<p>
  [XXV] We moved from a fact of the political economy, from the extracting of the worker and its production. We expressed the concept of this fact: the estranged, alienated work. We analyzed this concept and therefore we simply analyzed a fact of the political economy ...
 </p>
<p>
<b>
   ... if the product of work is foreign to me, it is facing me as a foreign power, to those who ever belong? If an activity that is mine does not belong to me, and it is an activity of others, a forced activity, to whom never belongs?
  </b>
</p>
<p>
<b>
   To a different being from me.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  But who is this being?
 </p>
<p>
  Are perhaps the gods? Certainly, in ancient times not only the main production, such as that of the times, etc., in Egypt, in India, in Mexico, appears to be performed at the service of the gods, but the same product belongs to the gods. Except that the gods were never the only masters themselves. Nor does nature ...
 </p>
<p>
  ..The being foreign, to whom the work and the product of work belong, who uses work and enjoys the product of work, can only be man.
 </p>
<p>
  If the product of work does not belong to the worker, and a foreign power is facing it, this is possible only for the fact that it belongs to another man foreign to the worker. If his activity is a torment for him, it must be a enjoyment for another, it must be the joy of the life of others. Not already the gods, not nature, but only man himself can be this unrelated power above man ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... if he is therefore in relation to the product of his work, to his work objectively as in relation to a foreign, hostile, powerful object, independent of him, lies in relation to it so that master of this object is another Man, unrelated to him, hostile, powerful and independent of him. If it refers to its own activity as a non -free activity, it refers to it as an activity that is at the service and under domination, coercion and yoke of another man ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... with the estranged work, man therefore constitutes not only his relationship with the object and with the act of production as a relationship, with foreign forces ed. hostile; But it also constitutes the relationship in which other men are with his production and with his product, and the relationship in which he is with these other men. As man makes his production his annihilation, his punishment, as well as his product makes a loss, that is, a product that does not belong to it,
  <b>
   Thus puts the lordship of the one who does not produce, on the production and product. As he makes his business foreign to himself, so the activity that is not his own ...
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  ... therefore, with the foreign work, alienated, the worker puts in place the relationship of a man who is foreign and outside the work, with this same work.
  <b>
   The relationship of the worker with the work puts in place the relationship of the capitalist
  </b>
  - or as otherwise you want to call the master of work - with work. The private property is therefore the product, the result, the necessary consequence of alienated work, of the relationship of extraneousness that is established between the worker, on the one hand, and nature and himself on the other.
 </p>
<p>
  Private property is therefore obtained through the analysis of the concept of alienated work, that is, of the alienated man, of the estranged work, of the estranged life, of the estranged man ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... Only at the top of its development, the private property reveals its secret, that is to say, first of all that it is the product of alienated work, secondly that it is the means by which the work is alienated, is the realization of This alienation.
 </p>
<p>
  This development immediately sheds light on different contradictions so far not resolved:
 </p>
<p>
  1) The political economy starts from work understood as the soul of production,
  <b>
   Yet it does not give anything to work while giving private property everything ...
  </b>
  This apparent contradiction is the contradiction of work estimated with himself, and that the political economy has done nothing but expose the laws of estranged work.
 </p>
<p>
  So we also recognize that salary and private property are the same thing, since the salary, to the extent that the product, the object of work, pays off the work itself, is only a necessary consequence of the extracting of the work; In fact, in wages, work also does not appear as an end in itself, but it is at the service of salary ...
 </p>
<p>
  ...
  <b>
   A forced increase in salary ... it would be nothing more than a better remuneration of the slaves
  </b>
  And it would not eleve the worker or work their human function and their dignity ...
 </p>
<p>
  ... from the relationship of work estimated with private property it also follows that the emancipation of the company from private property, etc., from slavery is expressed in the political form of the
  <b>
   Emancipation of the workers, not as if it were only this emancipation, but because in this emancipation the universal emancipation of man is contained;
  </b>
  which is contained there because
  <b>
   In the relationship of the worker with the production, all the enslavement of man is included, and all servant relationships are nothing but modifications and consequences of the first relationship ...
  </b>

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Let's start this press review on the events of the Budapest Hungary, 
 on what happened this weekend starting from the newspapers 
 Hungarians online, in particular we will redo us goods that can be 
 traced back to an area of the left and opposition to the government 
 Orban, but we also took a look at national newspapers 
 officers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We are there 
 focusing on this weekend because it was two 
 days when what we learned in Italy took place at 
 know how the "day of honor", that is, a commemoration 
 Nazi -fascist who has become the pretext for a meeting 
 International of Nazis and Fascists in Budapest. Meeting that takes place 
 above all because, as their leaders often declared, now 
 Hungary has become a safe place where you can freely meet, 
 freely show off the typical fascist symbols such as leisure, the 
 Nazi uniforms of the SS, where to make propaganda and in any case find 
 The opportunity to meet internationally.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These days 
 It was also an opportunity for an anti -fascism response 
 international. Last year this answer determined clashes 
 and violence between the fascist groups and the anti -fascists who brought 
 to arrests of some international anti -fascists, including ours 
 Ilaria Salis, of which the story is known and of which we will try to 
 Speak a little towards the end.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Concentrate 
 On the two days we can say that February 10 and February 11th 
 are considered as the commemoration of the siege of Budapest, a 
 Historical fact of the Second World War where the red army 
 Soviet by now surrounded Budapest - because Hungary was 
 Collaboration of Nazism - in an siege that ended with 
 the capitulation of both the occupant Nazi army and the 
 Hungarian collaborators.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Actually 11 
 February 1945, the "day of honor", what is called 
 So from the Nazi formations, he wants to remember an episode 
 specific, that is, the attempt by the Nazi army, 
 Hungarian army, a collaborator to break through this siege 
 making a suicidal attack on the mountains of Buda, then on the part 
 tall of the city of Budapest, which led to the massacre of 14,000 
 Germans and 2000 Hungarian soldiers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This was 
 The last attempt of the Nazi and Hungarian fascist rods of 
 not capitular and the result was however the liberation of Budapest 
 and of the country by the Nazis.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This aspect 
 historian it is important to know why this day of 
 commemoration of the siege of Budapest and its victims is a commemoration that has been taking place for many years, until 
 from the period in which Hungary was part of the Soviet bloc e 
 represented an initially anti -fascist anniversary, in the sense of one 
 recurrence that recalled the liberation of Hungary and the triumph e 
 the entrance of the red army. Only that for 10 years, taking like 
 episode this attempt to escape and evasion of the Nazis of '45 
 From the siege, today's Nazis have made one of them 
 day. And for several years the response of anti -fascism is not one 
 Make it wait.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Then let's see 
 this year. Last year there were clashes between both 
 Parts, there have been arrests of anti -fascists, including Ilaria Salis. 
 This year we see that from the newspapers that the events are 
 turned out to be peaceful, there have been no clashes, this for 
 the huge presence of the police who protected the fascists and avoided 
 contacts with anti -fascist groups. In reality there have been many 
 identification of anti -fascists, even those from outside 
 of Hungary and the arrest of a group of Germans is recorded 
 anti -fascists. On the other hand, it is ironic to think that, perhaps just a 
 cause of the fuss raised on the question of Ilaria Salis, 
 This year the government had forbidden the Nazi gatherings, made them 
 practically illegal, unless he did nothing for really 
 prevent them.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Fascist groups 
 appointments have been given on this day that was articulated not 
 only with events and commemorations, but also with concerts of 
 Filonazist groups and have not communicated in a manner 
 publishes the meeting places, even if the meeting places are then 
 more or less those of last year, in particular the castle of 
 Buda who is in the area where this attempt was in '45 of 
 evasion by the Nazi army and on the other hand they have 
 disguised their propaganda by passing it with a tour 
 commemorative. The result was therefore that in any case the 
 fascist manifestation has had and it was not really 
 It prevented, simply on a formal level it was prohibited.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand - i 
 newspapers emphasize it, especially the thread government - there is 
 A great emphasis in saying that this year everyone was given 
 right to manifest, also to the anti -fascist forces, which have been 
 authorized that therefore nothing could be charged at the level of 
 antidemocratic to this government, unless it emerges from 
 description of the goods of goods, of this leftist newspaper, 
 the attention of the police, both at the level of controls, of arrests - 
 As in the case of the German group - towards the anti -fascists it is 
 was much higher than that made against the fascists.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Twice 
 standard towards the treatment of anti -fascists compared to 
 treatment of anti -fascists is a custom here in Hungary, 
 precisely because the Hungarian government of Orban has this absolute 
 proximity to fascist groups and uses anti -fascism as a form 
 Not only of external repression, but also of internal repression. 
 In fact on this it would be appropriate to dwell by reading a little 
 These online newspapers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The manifestations 
 anti -fascists that are in Budapest and who have been repeated for 10 years, 
 as well as the fascist manifestations, they see a variety of 
 subjects present, not only international, such as those he had 
 Italy joined Italy, but also - and above all - anti -fascist groups 
 Hungarian.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Indeed 
 The image that comes to us from Hungary is often a bit 
 flattened on a single form of authoritarian government such as that of 
 Orban, which is certainly there, as a kind of approval 
 politics.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In reality we are 
 verifying that anti -fascism seeks in some way also there 
 be heard. In this case the manifestations of 10 and 11 
 February of Saturday and Sunday there were, they also saw the 
 presence of members of the Hungarian resistance - a bit like 
 Our Anpi - and also the other more contemporary forces that 
 claim anti -fascism, even one has been launched 
 event that had as the title “let's stop glorifying the 
 Nazism in Hungary ". This also makes it clear that the support that 
 Orban actually gives the Nazi formations to this celebration has 
 as a purpose above all that of having a sort of recognition 
 politic.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In fact the 
 affair of Ilaria Salis, reading the newspapers makes us understand that it entered 
 in an international game, also of pressure from the Union 
 European, there was the speech linked to the release of funding 
 For the war in Ukraine to which Orban has sold, giving his vote 
 positive for a new loan, but he used the story, 
 irreducibility, inflexibility towards Ilaria as 
 international tool to demonstrate within not selling 
 So easily to the pressure of the European Union, to pressure 
 international.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Anti -fascism 
 associated with terrorism, with violence, it is for the government of Orban, one 
 perfect excuse to criminalize any internal opposition that 
 It is not so flattened: last year Hungary was 
 crossed by great protests, both student and linked to 
 LGBT Movement, both of teachers against a very school reform 
 heavy in a neoliberal key, manifestations that there have been, that 
 they were repressed hard with arrests, charges, layoffs 
 of teachers. And then a whole a mechanism of repression in which 
 Ilaria Sarris in some way is suffering personally, but 
 that Hungarian opponents suffer, probably daily, 
 both from the procedural point of view and from the point of view of the 
 prison conditions, which from the point of view of repression 
 social at work, on the movement. The economic crisis, inflation e 
 high prices, the work crisis, external addiction 
 of Hungary, is making the Orban government vacillating that 
 So last year he found as a perfect scapegoat to be 
 external but above all internal the anti -fascist as a criminal e 
 terrorist, and this also makes you understand the fury from Ilaria 
 Salis.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But this year 
 International pressures have had the effect of trying to do 
 appear a lower profile by the government than 
 to the support for these Nazi formations. And on the other hand, instead of 
 totally discourage anti -fascism, made it quite more 
 lively. We have seen that the anti -fascist manifestations are there 
 State, they were various, there have been no clashes for the presence 
 of the police. But the words were clear against the return 
 of fascism, against revisionism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We cannot say 
 That this is leading to a real immediate turning point, indeed. 
 Orban's fascism took one step more than the action 
 repressive, but also with respect to a historical revisionism: in fact, 
 Just the Orban government, together with these Nazi formations that yes 
 they usually gather in Budapest and find space and consent, yes 
 they are promoting at the level of the European Union of 
 An attribution of the responsibility of the Second World War 
 to the same Soviet Union, an impressive historical reversal 
 However, it makes the game, even internal, to lead to one 
 criminalization of anti -fascists as terrorists and criminals 
 and therefore the real risk is that if there is no turning point the year 
 next, perhaps the anti -fascist manifestations could 
 be the prohibited and more criminalized ones.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This year is 
 was an interlocutory commemoration that we will see in the future 
 It really has meant.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We resume this week at 12 noon counter -information Rosso Operaia 
 First of all, informing those who listen to us that the new number has come out 
 of the printed newspaper which is taken from the counter -information 
 daily we do four times a week in this new 
 year. The printed number has a particular function, that of 
 Select between the themes and pieces covered in the daily 
 Audio counter -information and make a direct intervention tool 
 Among the workers, the workers, the masses, both first of all to the places of 
 work, to the concierge of the factories, in the assemblies of 
 workers held by the Slai Cobas or by the various organizations 
 trade unions and be used in participation in the events and 
 They are held in various realities during the week.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This number 
 contains and resumes the problem of the war and the role of Italy 
 in the war commenting on the interview with that pig who is the 
 Minister Crosetto, peak minister of the Meloni government, linked e 
 salary - as has been shown - by the big industries 
 Belliche, in particular by Leonardo. This minister is now the 
 Official voice of the worst wing of militarism and imperialism 
 Italian.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Did 
 An interview that we commented. This comment is present in 
 printed number of 12 hours to be released today under the title "The 
 Meloni/Crosetto government goes to the wars for profits and wants i 
 reservists ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Another article 
 which is contained is that relating to Meloni's journey in 
 Japan who, beyond how it was presented and uncensized and al 
 beyond the objective fact that Meloni went to Japan to 
 collect the scepter for the management of the new G7 - which this year 
 It is held in Italy, in Puglia, around mid -June - that 
 It will be very important both for our country and at the level 
 world. We are among those who want this G7 to be 
 strongly contested in June, with a great participation 
 national and international. But in the meantime the trip to Japan is 
 was also much more, like all the recent trips of Meloni: 
 On the one hand the placer of the masters, he goes there to tighten bonds 
 cheap with large industries, with the large multinationals of 
 Japan, to favor both the ties with Italy and serve them on a 
 silver plate within the criticality of Italian situations such as 
 Economic platform at the service of general economic interests 
 of imperialism and masters. Think of the car sector, think 
 to steel, etc. etc.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other element 
 of these travels are to bind militarily, organize the 
 Military Italian presence - In this case in the great and strategic 
 Pacific indoor chessboard where the reasons are also accumulating there 
 of the clash between the imperialist powers, primarily US/China in 
 march that unfortunately seems unstoppable towards a third conflict 
 World - And in this context Meloni acts as a Piazzista 
 of the war industry, cannon merchants, as the title says.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other part of 
 This printed number is linked to the protest of farmers. The 
 title says everything: “The protest of farmers also represents 
 The interest of workers and masses? ”To this question the articles 
 made by the audio counter -information say no and try to 
 explain it by giving a tool to the proletarians and popular masses for 
 to orient themselves between the right things and the wrong things of this great 
 protest.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Finally two pages 
 We have dedicated this young man to the freedom of Ilaria Salis 
 anti -fascist, truly courageous, active, which went to challenge the 
 Nazis and the regime that protects them with Orban, great friend of Salvini 
 And Meloni, it is a real heroine of our time. And for this, 
 As many times it has happened to the heroes and heroines in the events 
 historical, it is treated like a beast chained when the real 
 Beasts are in government and real beasts are friends in Italy of 
 This government.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  A page is 
 dedicated to the struggle and contradictions present in the two greats 
 Industrial factories or complexes of our country: to Stellantis 
 Mirafiori where the workers took to strike and this is one 
 very good news against the closing plans of 
 reduction of masters and the contradictions between masters and 
 government downloaded to workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And the other is the 
 Infinite affair of the former Ilva where - in particular in the Ilva contract 
 - A life is fought for life and death, certainly not of the 
 establishment - or we would also say of the plant - but first of all 
 The life of the workers of the contract that are all at home in the cashier 
 integration, anteroom of redundancies and layoffs, while it continues 
 The theater of the absurd of the comparison masters - Arcelmitittal in 
 primis - government that, now as now, is downloaded to workers, 
 First of all also through non -payment of credits to 
 companies of the contract, many of which depend on these payments 
 for their business continuity.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This 
 Counter -information rossusoia is a small number but with large ones 
 reasons and with great themes it addresses, which we distribute a 
 contribution or free of charge to workers, because workers must 
 have in their hands a concrete tool in the workplace for 
 be able to orient themselves on things and to be able to stabilize as a subject 
 real of our work, which then means worker autonomy, 
 organization, intensification of the class struggle against masters 
 and government but, in perspective, to overthrow government masters and the 
 their system.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The newspapers of 
 Today two things particularly highlight: what happens 
 in Palestine, where the regime of Zionist monsters, neo -Nazis, 
 represented by the state of Israel and its Netanyahu government, 
 protected armed from American imperialism and supported among all 
 governments, he wants to conduct another stage of the ongoing genocide, he wants 
 attack Rafah to massacre the Palestinians, drive them out like mice 
 from their land and get their hands on the entire strip of Gaza e 
 They make another piece of the state of Israel. A crime against 
 humanity, a genocide in place, as the Court of 
 European justice that opened a process on this - has it 
 declared admissible - that we must help to stop 
 First of all with the worker and popular mobilization, which serves not 
 only to express solidarity, but to force governments, institutions, 
 however they are, to contribute to the ceased the fire and to stop the 
 Genocida of Israel.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The other aspect is 
 The potential agreement that would be made with a wing of 
 Movement of farmers, the one called "agricultural redemption" 
 and the government through the meetings that there were with the 
 Minister Lollobrigida. This agreement are the crumbs for whom 
 he really fought for survival, which serve to stop the 
 fight, both in the right reasons and in the reasons we call 
 unjust, that is, of those claims that we do not share and that 
 they are also linked to the relationship between the agricultural world and the government, 
 that certainly does not arise in these hours, but it is previous and is a part 
 of that world, that of landowners, medium producers, 
 who has already supported the government in his ascent.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So of this 
 agreement of one thing we are sure: it will not solve the problems of the 
 small agriculture, will not solve the problems of the workers of the 
 earth, will not solve the problems that originate unhealthy agriculture 
 and a frightening increase in prices, of agriculture products, 
 through the infamous chain that transforms them into profit for the 
 large trade multinationals.

  The unthinkable slave revolt
 </h2>
<p>
<b>
   Those who say that Israel was aware of the plans of 7 
 October are reconfirming an old colonial common place according to 
  to which the natives are too docile, too submissive, too cowardly and 
 Too inferior to rebel against their oppressors.
  </b>
</p>
<p>
  Zubayr Alikhan - February 8, 2024
 </p>
<p>
  On 7 October 2023 the Palestinians launched the largest 
 Decolonial operation in the history of Palestine. They saw the 
 their chains, they demolished the cage and sautéed the walls of 
  iron. The Palestinians took flight. They blinded the cameras, 
  Communications and penetrated the settlements interrupted. They have 
 paralyzed a colony of nuclear colonists and have brought to their knees 
 The Empire. They cut the umbilical cord of inexpression, of the 
  safety and sacrosanct domain, vital for all projects 
 colonial.
 </p>
<p>
  Immediately, imperial scribes and politicians, settlers and administrators 
 colonial, conservative and liberal - especially liberals - are 
 put at work. Their task was twofold: to ensure that the world 
 saw natives as wild hordes, barbarians, animals, quintessence 
 del evil - Here the liberals quickly forgot theirs 
 political correctness and havetened to condemn - and 
 at the same time restore the domain.
 </p>
<p>
  The first stormed the world, but for anyone who was healthy to 
 mind has always been fallacious and now it has been tirelessly and 
 completely dispelled. The second, however, has permeated the mind of 
 Many, even those potentially well intentioned. This 
 restoration of the empire has manifested themselves in several ways: the Palestinians 
 they could not have escaped alone, they would not have been able to penetrate 
  there
  <span>
</span>
  Iron dome, Israeli security systems are too much 
 advanced to be overcome or unarmed - Israel “has let it 
 they did. "
 </p>
<p>
  Without losing a blow, an unprecedented operation that shattered the concept of imperial invincibility
  <em>
   has been reformulated as an imperial tool
  </em>
  . 
  It was part of a plan
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 wider general to strengthen and expand 
  further the domain: the natives were senseless pawns 
 provision of an omniscient colonial power and intellectually 
 supreme. From this vein of thought - and in it - many emerged 
 Other truths, half truths and lies that highlight and consolidate it 
 the socket. According to some, Israel had actually supported and created 
 Hamas. Netanyahu had planned all this to win the next 
 Elections, support others. And my favorite - especially because it is now 
  been enriched by the Zionist stenographers of
 <em>
  New York Times
 </em>
 - "Israel had always knew."
 <span>
</span>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Surely, the next discovery will be that Israel knew of the flood 
  of Al-Aqsa before the Palestinians themselves, who invented it, has it 
 Presented in Hamas and inculcated it in the minds of the Palestinians. At the 
 basis of all this - and to constitute the raison d'etre collective 
 These theories - there is the unthinkability of the slave revolt (or gods 
 natives).
 </p>
<span id="more-26848">
</span>
<p>
  The unthinkability of the slave revolt is a concept introduced 
 by Michel-Rolph Trouillot to explain the answers, silences and the 
 silence of the western empire on the Haitian revolution. While 
 Trouillot uses it in relation to the 18th century imperialists, this 
  unthinkability is applied without interruption to the present: 
 the empire, its ideologies, its colonialism, its genocides and the 
 His colonies are not stories to study, but material realities and violence 
 lived. Today.
 </p>
<p>
  At the outbreak of the Haitian revolution, the most common reaction in 
 France, England, Spain and the United States was disbelief. The news 
 It was false. The facts-just like those of the Al-Aqsa flood- 
 They were too improbable. In any case, the facts had to be false, 
 Because blacks, like the Palestinians, were beasts without brain, wild 
  forced to docility, lazy, disorganized and lower: they were 
 absolutely unable to devise such an operation, much less than 
  organize and make it.

    This 
  title page of the novel of 1802, "'' Incandie du cap, ou le règne de 
 Toussaint-Louverture ”of the French novelist René Périn, has become 
 one of the most recognizable representations of the Haitian revolution, 
  used as a propaganda that delegated the revolution and attacked 
  His leader, Toussaint Louverture, which Périn described as a "Negro 
  atrocious ”of which he wanted to“ offer a portrait on which, reader, 
 You may be forced to pay many tears !!! " Illustration 
 It depicts a well-dressed toussoint-eLuverture that presides over the ruthless 
  massacre of innocent whites, many of which are women and children. [On 
 This epic revolt was written a great book: the black Jacobins. The first revolt against the white man, of C.L.R. James]
   </i>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Even if the rebels had somehow evoked the spirits and 
 completed miracles, intellectual, military, economic superiority and 
 Razziale dei Bianchi assured that they would be quickly tamed, 
 chained and put again at work. The problem, however, was 
 just that the West was reacting - to the fact that occurred - and 
 devising explanations, while the blacks and the Palestinians implemented 
  the unthinkable, actively neutralize the colonial forces and 
 claimed the lands.
 </p>
<p>
  Slowly and reluctantly, the reality of the operations made its way. 
  The news of ruthless black hordes that massacred the whites reached 
 Europe, and the Zionists proclaimed the "horrors of San 
 Domingo ". The news therefore had to be rationalized in one way 
 Different: the obvious facts were, they are still unthinkable. Therefore, the 
 revolution was “an unfortunate repercussion of the calculation errors of the 
  farmers ", the flood of Al-Aqsa was the result of" A waterfall of 
  False years duration of years ”of Israel,“ did not aim at a change 
 revolutionary ”, did not aim at decolonization,“ it was not 
 supported by the majority of the slave population ”, was Hamas 
 who acted alone and the Palestinians did not support them, “it is due 
 to external agitators, "Iran instigated," was the ... consequence of 
 various connive conspiracy by non -slaves ”, there have been 
 “Fugs of news within the security establishment of security 
 Israeli". With blacks and Palestinians intellectually null, “each 
 party has chosen his favorite enemy as the conspirator plus 
 probable ... [and] he accused himself of being the mind behind the 
 revolt". The British, the realists and the mules were in Haiti; in 
 Palestine, Iran was the mind, and behind them, Russia and China.
 </p>
<p>
  Here, some will probably rush to throw insults or ad 
 accuse me of naivety for neglecting the clear facts (as if 
 I was the empire) of Zionist knowledge. I will clarify. None of this 
 that I wrote is to say that the Zionist regime certainly does not 
 he knew - even if my visceral instinct still hesitates to believe that 
 he knew - but rather that the operation was unthinkable for them, that 
  their knowledge/not knowing is irrelevant, and that the development of 
 events and their results are not in their omnipotent hands, but in those 
  of the Palestinians, of the owners of the earth and resistance.
 </p>
<p>
  It is interesting to note that, among all the work of tachigraphy 
 imperial presented in the Times survey on the Al-Aqsa flood, 
 There is a line that has been neglected and underestimated especially in 
 effort to bomb the revolutionary successes of 7 October in the Kingdom 
 of the Empirium, under siege, or rather, without memory.
 </p>
<p>
  It can therefore be deduced that this sentence has a potential truth:
 </p>
<p>
  “[Israel kept the] fatally inaccurate conviction that Hamas 
 He did not have the ability to attack and would not have dared to do it ... [one] 
 conviction thus rooted in the Israeli government ... to ignore the 
 growing evidence of the opposite ".
 </p>
<p>
  Note the perception of Palestinian inability - and docility 
 through fear - as well as the recognition that an operation of 
 genre was so viscerally unthinkable that the Zionists, like the 
 Europeans of 1792, they have disavowed their own eyes. Such is 
 The arrogance of the empire, and here is its destruction.
 </p>
<p>
  Imperialism is based on the idea itself, on the centrality and 
 supremacy of the ego on those who await the conquest and the 
 civilization. The primarity of the empire rests on secondary 
 of the other. Imperial superiority is based on native inferiority. 
 Yet, paradoxically, this secondary and inferiority are 
 indispensable to the primarity and superiority of the European and the Empire. 
  Events such as the Haitian revolution, the attack on the Milk Bar e 
 The flood of Al-Aqsa, invert, overturn or shatter completely 
 These hierarchies.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, for the native, this violence is a "purifying force", 
 frees him “from his inferiority complex, from his despair and 
 inertia; It makes it fearless and restores self -respect. To do this, 
 If the native frees itself from its inferiority complex, it is no longer 
 inferior; If it is no longer lower, the colonizer is not higher; self 
 The colonizer is not superior, then the idea of empire comes 
 Compromise, the idols collapse and imperialism falls.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore
  <b>
   , writes Fanon, “it is precisely when he [the 
 native] realizes his humanity that begins to sharpen the weapons with which 
  The victory will ensure. "
  </b>
  The function of rationalizing theories 
 which clarify the unthinkable then becomes evident: it is the 
 preservation of the domain, of the hierarchy, the future of the colonists, the 
 imperial self.
 </p>
<p>
  The threat posed by any act of indigenous resistance in 
 Any part of the colonized world is not simply a threat 
 material for its direct objective or for the local lordship, but a 
 existential scourge against empire and imperialism in his 
 complex. In the always relevant words of Ghassan Kanafani, 
 "Imperialism has placed its body in the world, her head in Asia 
 Eastern, the heart in the Middle East, its arteries reach 
 Africa and Latin America. Wherever you hit him, damn him and serve the 
  World Revolution ".
 </p>
<p>
  I have to conclude with an explanation. The idea for this piece is to me 
 came for the first time on October 7th. Since then I have thought of 
 Writing it, but I found myself blocked by the devastation of the genocide. 
  How can I write about something in addition to the genocide? In fact, while 
 You are reading this piece, a Palestinian child - the soul of the soul 
  of someone - he was assassinated to Gaza. Every 7 minutes. As i 
  days were transformed into months, thinking, talking or writing about 
 anything else seemed more and more inappropriate, even 
 immoral. After an endless debate, I remembered the scheme 
 of colonial history: after an act of resistance of the natives it arrives the 
 More ferocious and unbridled brutality than the colony of settlers. It is designed 
 To teach a lesson, to make his triumphs forget - native - 
  however small - in order to swallow it in the fire and drown it in 
 blood until it consumes it. It cannot be afforded that this cancellation 
  And conquest remain unchallenged.
 </p>
<p>
  While we look at the press agencies, politicians, ideologists and 
  spectators to explain an unprecedented situation, depriving the 
 Palestinians of free will - and of humanity - we must recognize 
 The hygiene, civil and trivializing gear of the machine 
  imperial at stake. While the bombs fall on Gaza, trying to 
 cancel the memory of the Palestinians of their victory, to bury 
  under the rubble their glimmer of liberation and to delete from 
 world the memory of their presence,
  <b>
   we must not forget. 7 
 October, Palestine has overturned the imperial world order and today, or 
  Tomorrow, in ten or one hundred years, it will be free.
  </b>

  his sister, both today in Israel, would be willing to invoke one 
  non -binding popular consultation to try to avoid the 
 parliament.
 </p>
<p>
  Some official tweets of the government party were still 
 worst: “Betrayal is paid dear and freedom will do not allow 
  that governors damage the people to maintain their own 
 privileges. The Basic Law returns to the Commission ".
 </p>
<p>
  This tone of moral superiority and offended dignity cannot bring 
 very far away "The forces of the sky". Have promoted a project of 
 manifest unconstitutionality, which aspires to a reformulation of the 
 Argentine company. The whole of his text of the law implies 
 an aggression to popular interests and gives white paper to the great ones 
 cheap groups do their business as they condemn the 
 majority to poverty, eminus, hunger.
 </p>
<p>
  With this "program" they could not even agree 
 With most of those who were widely willing to "collaborate", 
  like the legislators (right) of the radical civic union and those of the 
  New block "Let's do federal coalition". And emerge from this 
 situation with a growing clash with legislative power. And with i 
 Provincial governors, including those who come together for 
 the gearbox (right), since they have been accused and threatened 
 indiscriminately the provincial agents.
 </p>
<p>
  The government has not helped the government given by a whole one 
 Fan of "security" forces that day after day in Buenos Aires 
 He triggered the repression against demonstrators in Plaza Congreso. That 
 they were nothing else that women and men tired of seeing worsening the 
 their own living conditions and trampling on their rights. And react 
 with fright and anger against a rule that heralds abuse a lot 
 worse.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   On the wet ... now the decree
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  To complete an unfortunate day for the current managers of the 
 "Public thing", a federal judge issued a request for 
 direct information to the Ministry of Security, with a term of 72 
 hours to respond, on the elaboration and application of the protocol that 
  He wants to suppress public events.
 </p>
<p>
  This measure could lead to a declaration of 
 unconstitutionality of the repressive tool designed and applied by 
 Minister Patricia Bullich. The same that will continue to be 
 fought in the streets, as it almost has already happened since the same day 
 in which it was issued.
 </p>
<p>
  Tuesday the LLA government experienced an important slide and 
  even a part of those who can e 
 They want to be his allies, as we have already exposed.
 </p>
<p>
  In any case, we must not be fooled. The defeat is not total 
 nor definitive. The furious adjustment that promotes the minister 
 of the economy Luis Caputo continues its course, as Tuesday has it 
 The same immense increase in public transport was demonstrated. At the 
 at the same time the DNU 70/23 continues to stand, which contains it 
 time a “
  <em>
   empowerment
  </em>
  ”Of the great capital in each of his 
 clauses. In which, among many other provisions, it changes in 
 a regressive sense most of the labor law and get rid of 
 Any restriction every type of contracts. The law of the strongest.
 </p>
<p>
  Without a doubt now the popular struggle and critical points of view 
 they will go against this rule, which will be in force until you 
 will reach the parliamentary rejection or, the thing that is more likely, 
 is declared unconstitutional.
 </p>
<p>
  The organizations that are mobilized in the protest is unlikely that 
 wait for one or the other. They will continue to stay in the public space, 
 they will persist in the request to the CGT to launch a struggle plan, yes 
  They will unite new organizations and thousands of will to occupy squares 
  And roads making their right requests feel. By trade union groups 
  combatives to social movements and left parties, passing through the 
 associations of pensioners and the reborn popular assemblies, not 
 they will back into their commitment.
 </p>
<p>
  ***
 </p>
<p>
  The government is hit, its "star project" bite the dust 
 After long days of discussion and dozens of injuries after it is 
 His discussion began. The messianic gaze that characterizes it 
  He will lead him with certainty to be a bad loser. It's a lot 
 probable that you try to double the bet, that it makes a 
 Even more bitter adjustment. And that you try to attribute “powers 
 extraordinary ”, without the consent of anyone else than his supporters 
 more fervent.
 </p>
<p>
  Real democracy, social conquests, level of life, yes 
 they will defend on the street. Also there it will be necessary to make the struggle so that the 
 freedom do not continue to be thrown into the mud by those who believe 
 that the only subjects who deserve it are large companies. AND 
 so that the "... everyone goes away ..." recover his original meaning, later 
  his absurd appropriation by those who go against the 
 people who rebelled in 2001.

<p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The struggle of workers historically is always the union struggle of 
 workers, and is concentrated on two problems, i.e. working hours and salary like two 
 Central issues that animate the clash between masters and workers. THE 
 Masters always say that "we are in the same boat", if I go 
 Well you will be well workers. And the government the same. He says 
 Meloni explicitly: we work for companies to earn 
 So they earn workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We know yes 
 It is a fairy tale. Who has a minimum of brain on the spot of 
 I work well that it doesn't work like this.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But in each 
 case two issues are in the center and which are in the center today 
 because we are in difficulty as a worker movement, like struggles of 
 workers and workers: the question of salary and the question 
 of the time.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In Germany, for 
 example, the struggle of 80,000 steel shadows obtained the reduction 
 time from 35 to 32 hours
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 paid 33, together with a one -off of 3,000 
 € that held in 1994 and a 5.5% wage increase from 
 2025.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There 
 justification of the German unions is simple: after 
 The introduction of new plants will serve less hours of work for the 
 steel production. Hence the speech of the 4 days of 
 I work for the same salary that find a justification in the 
 development of production itself, and in the shortest time of work that 
 It is used to produce what was previously produced in longer.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The masters don't 
 they are never, because for them all that is not necessary work 
 It is surplus value, that is, profit. So says the newspaper of 
 Entrepreneurs in Germany: "Yes, it would be nice but wrong".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The goodsense 
 He says that “a week of 4 days, with the same remuneration, 
 could make a significant contribution to maintaining the car sector 
 attractive for young people. It would be a tested remedy for deficiency 
 of labor ". This does not say it who knows which Marxist or which one 
 Communist but the president of the metalworking union says so 
 main in Germany.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  They seem 
 expressions of pure common sense and common sense should be 
 even at the base of the trade union platforms and the struggle in 
 breasts to the factories.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  On the other hand 
 It would be enough to ask the workers and in Germany they did it. A 
 survey reported by the French newspaper, the Monde, resumes it and 
 He says: 75% of German workers would like to go to 4 days a 
 Salary equality. And it reaffirms that this would be even more 
 palatable for young people, who certainly think that they must be on 
 workplace 8 hours and then extraordinary and then etc etc. it is not that the 
 It seems an acceptable future.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The struggle for the 
 Reduction from working hours to equal pay is the struggle of 
 Lotte for the worker movement. Today in all the factories of Italy, 
 like in Europe and the world.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, the crisis, 
 the attack on the workplace, the reduction of wages, dissuade from 
 think that this struggle can be done. And then make this struggle 
 It seems more a problem than a solution.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This is this 
 which is to be overturned. We started that this thing happened 
 First of all, among the steelurgicals. Let's think about the crisis 
 of the steel industry - so not to make names of the former Ilva, of 
 Italian steel mills - such as the reduction in working hours to the same 
 pays both the right and necessary claim to face too 
 the states of crisis, conversion/transformation that these 
 industries necessarily have to cross.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But the problem is 
 Always this: the difficulty of fighting for the reduction of the time 
 of work in the face of wages that are not defended. The defense of 
 salary is the food necessary to be able to seriously do the struggle 
 for the reduction of working hours but it is on the wage front that 
 Instead we see the strongest retreat of workers.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The relationship between 
 The inflation and recovery of wages is clearly disadvantage of 
 wages.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The struggle for the 
 salary, however, cannot be made with contracts that produce 
 Salary increases of little more than a coffee per day. If the 
 salary has been cut dryly it is evident that it must be recovered 
 dryly and the roads have always been only two: reintroduction 
 of the escalator to mitigate the effects of caravan, 
 inflation and price increase and wage increase 
 corresponding to productivity, not that calculated by the masters, 
 but the one objectively visible from the amount of work to do 
 The products that are made within the factories.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is around 
 These two things that are grafted the wage increase that today, for 
 be imposed, it must start from the jobs. So it happened 
 also in France and in other countries. We must not wait for the contracts. 
 When wages descend - and in this period they go down - you have to 
 Starting with real wage disputes, it would take at least requests 
 of € 500 to be able to rebalance. Then they get a little less, 
 But the important thing is to leave, the wage struggle is certain 
 Even in contracts, fight and what is not touched is the request 
 wage. Instead normally we start from a figure and you get to a 
 coffee a day.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Inside, however, the 
 wage issue is the question of discrimination within breast 
 to the factories. And on this we should talk about it for a long time. The 
 wage differences between workers and workers. Wages that 
 They are given to the less protected sectors, to immigrant workers. AND 
 etc. On this there are irrefutable data of the permanence and 
 extension of wage discrimination.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For the same 
 Work must be equal to salary. This applies above all 
 for workers and even more - given the situation - for the 
 immigrant workers.

<p>
  Workers and workers, it is truly a shame what yesterday is 
 Success in Naples and Turin. Two manifestations of young people e 
 very young, belonging to the student movement, in 
 particular in Turin the students of "We change course", the 
 solidarity activists with Palestine, belonging to several 
 associations, to power to the people, to reality of the social centers, ad 
 Askatasuna in Turin, in Naples to the various active social realities that 
 They rightly protested under the direction of Rai.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  This Rai does 
 disgusting, has become telemelons in the hands of the men of the government as never 
 It was seen before. Even before, television was in the hands of the 
 Parties, he was in the hands of governments, for heaven's sake, let alone! We have 
 views of cooked and raw and we know how they are placed at Rai 
 Journalists/Journalists…. not to use vulgar words.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But Telemeloni lo 
 It does with arrogance. He says he is "rebalancing" for them that they are 
 have been excluded for years. False! Men of this government or parties 
 of this government there have been - all right - within the Rai, if they are 
 SHOPT FIRST, Just think of Salvini, and we spread a pitiful veil 
 on Forza Italia by Berlusconi. They would be the last ones who can 
 speak in this way, but they are doing it, they are doing it 
 And in a vulgar, arrogant, provocative way they are implementing it.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And which means 
 Telemeloni? that you must not say things that can disturb the 
 government and his
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 propagated image H 24 on these televisions e 
 who does not hesitate to use anything: the last they used is the 
 Sanremo Festival, where first/during and after we witnessed a 
 Manfrines against the political use of the Festival, only to use it. AND 
 When a Ghali singer dared to remember with a short performance 
 - 5 minutes! - that a genocide is taking place in Palestine, where they are 
 So far about 30,000 people died, mostly children and teenagers, 
 where there is a people who are hunted for the fury of bombs from their own 
 Houses, from all over the Gaza strip, don't know where they have to put them, 
 they want them or bury or carry on the moon possibly, the 
 Nazi's Nazi -type Zionist regime, supported by everyone 
 those hypocrites, from explicit ones such as American imperialism, 
 specialist in massacres, etc ... ecc .., and by those implicit like i 
 European governments, the Italian government, accomplices of genocide.
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But it is not of 
 This we want to talk, we talk about it every day. Let's talk about the 
 the fact that Ghali says "genocide" and breaks out who knows what! The 
 Sanremo Festival must only be songs. We are not experts of 
 this, but there would be many stories to tell, stories and 
 History.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But what is 
 scandalous is that Rai censors the singers when they piss out of the 
 jar. And as soon as this indignation and solidarity realities with the cause 
 Palestinian - many boys take to the streets to protest - 
 Mazzate, Manganelli like Selvaggi, just see the videos.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Of course, it's not that 
 one goes under Rai and says "bad", he calls them Assassini, 
 It is not that it goes under Rai and can accept that there is one 
 Schiament of policemen as the criminal gangs are coming. 
 And then loaded, blows, blood in the face, split heads.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Daughters 
 stepchildren. There are those who can block the roads legitimately, there are those who 
 He can tell all the colors and nothing happens to him. There are the 
 guys who go in solidarity with Palestine to say 
 "Genocide", like the singer and to solidarize, and down them 
 blow!
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Here, this is 
 Fascism, it was a police, it is arrogance of power, it is dictatorship! 
 These things are seen in Hungary where there is Ilaria Salis or in America 
 Latina where South American dictatorships are famous. But these 
 dictatorships are arriving in Italy through the Meloni government, the 
 Garbatella fascistella, ascent to the throne, behind the face 
 so -called "clean" are the worms that use the state for 
 occupy it, the televisions to occupy them, the institutions for 
 occupy them. And down to get with the police.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Solidarity, 
 solidarity and we do 10-100-1000 events of this type 
 Where there are the Rai offices, let's do other where there are no 
 Rai offices, we choose the objectives consistent with this, we break the 
 censorship, we say a simple truth: in Palestine there is a 
 genocide. Enough, we don't want anything else.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Even the 
 government says, they are exaggerating, they had to kill 10,000, we are 
 arrived at 30,000, they had to kill the terrorists, then the terrorists 
 They are all and we all kill them.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  In this sense 
 This thing is important, because - attention - so far on 
 work, on salary, on the houses and so on, we joked 
 we would say to the masses, we did not do anything in front of the wages 
 cut, to the denied work, to the health on which we find a veil 
 pitiful. And what about the school? Casomai we talk about it later.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is good if the 
 masses protest seriously and do neither processions, that “the 
 Government must help us ", blah blah blah ... are blows.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But who sows 
 Wind collects storm. Be careful that foolish boys are not, 
 You can't take them and that's it. Think, experience and this 
 experience we hope that it serves because if these governments do not do 
 They go with their own legs, they will have to go to other forms.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Solidarity with 
 The boys of Turin and Naples attacked and beaten by the police 
 Under Rai.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Via Tele Meloni! 
 And not because we expect a lot, but a little decency ce 
 We would wait for her.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Or we will end up the 
 Will Rai manage Sgarbi?
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  We continue to talk about school again. Certainly the students 
 They are not a wonder both for the levels of education they receive 
 in these schools, both for what happens to him as soon as they come out of 
 School: unemployment, precarious jobs or staying at home 
 of families are not known for how many years, families who when 
 they are those of the workers who bleed to ensure 
 education and a future and which instead are always in a school 
 more class, where there must be an elite that can go to 
 school and enter the so -called company, which is then the capital, 
 in the so -called political world, which is then carrierism, 
 traffic and lecying.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Well, the 
 Students occasionally lift their heads and protest. 
 First of all they did it with great generosity against 
 the school/work alternation which, in the name of learning the 
 craft while you go to school, they sent them to the mistake to do 
 Internships in some factories and boys died.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  One went to 
 school, led him to the internship and never returned home.

<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  It is clear that i 
 guys they mobilized against school/work alternation, have 
 said enough, they protested, they made children who died of theirs 
 Symbols - positive symbols - showing those who scare what pasta 
 they are really made when they embrace important and non -important issues 
 unfortunately cracks.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Now instead we are 
 passed to phase 2. A minister, an illustrious stranger, of those 
 ridiculous professors, from television fiction, of the last century, that 
 Now he is minister, Valditara, who one day pretends to deal with the 
 school in terms actually of what the school is o 
 it should be and in the 364 days only deals with repression, of 
 how to ensure that schools are a barrack 
 to which educational institutions are untouchable. Indeed, that if the 
 Touch the life sentence should give you, not to mention the normal 
 Student activities.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  There are periods 
 in which the students, to make their voices heard, do the 
 strikes, the events. They occupy schools, it is their way 
 natural to be heard. In these schools it is not that it happens who knows 
 What during the months of education. Indeed, many times, during the 
 occupations "something happens" and when "something happens", 
 not the inevitable and unbalanced vandalism acts, but when 
 In the occupations it is protesting, we think, they deepen things 
 And certainly not only of the school, but of the world around them. Why 
 This school is neither a happy island, nor a ghetto is in 
 world and the world is made of wars, of genocides in Palestine, of 
 Things that every day should make you indignant and is 
 Right that the students take care of it.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Well, now the 
 occupations are reason for votes in conduct etc. etc., it seems 
 Really that we went back to the last century.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Things like this 
 they originated the greatest movement of students in the history of 
 This country that is called '68. Do you want a new '68? Well, 
 Maybe you are giving it to us.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  Rather than 
 Thinking about what can happen, let's look at what happens. 
 Students cannot be repressed because they occupy schools. Not 
 small episodes can be demanded during the 
 occupations as if they had set the country on fire. Here, this is not 
 can do.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  And therefore in the 
 schools must be contrasted any repressive measure to 
 Who expresses dissent, who struggle, who occupies.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  The Barracks School 
 of Valditara must not pass.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  But we have 
 Used the word school-chaserma and this means that in schools 
 Is there an exaggerated discipline and repression if you violate it? NO! vuol 
 To say that school/work alternation must be alternated school/barracks. 
 Schools must be militarized and when they put on - e 
 This government seems specialist - they make it dirty: they managed to 
 put the uniform also to children, using instrumentally 
 Various issues. The idea of the militarization of the school, 
 military training, to make the idea of restoration penetrate 
 At the end of the military lever - now we speak of the reservists, then yes 
 It will talk about new recruits - it is the prospect of using young people 
 depending on the war.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  You want that 
 We all say we don't want more wars, you want us to 
 We declare pacifists. Unfortunately in power there are warfondonas a 
 service of those who earn wars, that is, profits 
 of the war industry and the system of multinationals that on 
 wars earn exceptional profits, they are governments that use the 
 State budget such as ATM, personal banks 
 of the war industry - This part of the budget is not touched! -  And 
 All this falls into the student condition, in trying to 
 truly transform school into that of fascism.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  All this does not 
 must pass. It is a problem of the students for which it is right 
 rebel, but it is a problem of workers, of the "citizens", 
 As they say, where for "citizens" we are a little diverted. 
 We think of the popular masses, those who live in work or that not 
 They live, and, if they live, they live in precariousness and not work. Well, 
 It is a question. They cannot consider the school only in 
 to which their children must be protected, to interviews with professors or if 
 There is some professor who says a bad word must be insulted and 
 Sometimes attacked - lousy things regardless. But they must 
 occupy the future, of what really happens in the school e 
 of what is the future of the new generations that is in the school 
 the center.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  These ministers 
 they cannot exist, these governments are a curse for the 
 present and for the future of the school and the future of the children is 
 First of all in the head. To then say everything else.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  So no to 
 school-school.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No to alternation 
 school/work.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  No to 
 repression in schools.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 108%; margin-bottom: 0.28cm;">
  For a school 
 in the hands of the students, not to make them who knows that, but why if 
 There is an use of them and transform the school into a true school of life, school 
 of ideas, school of criticism, school of freedom, democracy and, in 
 future, a school service of all the people.

<p>
  From the "What to do?": "But why the spontaneous movement ... goes towards 
 The dominance of bourgeois ideology? For the simple reason that 
 For its origin, bourgeois ideology is much older than 
 the socialist one, it is more elaborate in all its aspects e 
 It has incomparably larger means of diffusion ... "
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Still, in a note: 
 “It is often said the working class aspires spontaneously to 
 socialism. This is very right in the sense that more deeply e 
 more exactly than all the others the socialist theory determines the 
 causes of the ailments of the working class and therefore the workers can 
 assimilate it easily,
  <i>
   so long as
  </i>
  this theory not chapters 
 in front of spontaneity,
  <i>
   so long as
  </i>
  we do not subject to the 
 spontaneity, the working class aspires spontaneously to socialism 
 but the bourgeois ideology that is the most widespread (and that constantly 
 It rises in the most varied forms), however, it is imposed 
 spontaneously more than any other at the worker.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Referring to 
 Journal of Economism, Rabociaja Myisl Lenin writes: “Don't denial 
 completely the political struggle ... speaks of the fight against the government ... 
 He just thinks that politics always follows
  <span>
</span>
</p>
<a name="more">
</a>
 the economy ... these 
 thesis are absolutely false,
 <i>
  If by politics we mean the 
 social democratic policy
 </i>
 (Communist editor's note). The economic struggle 
 of the workers, as we have seen, is very often linked (although not 
 inextricably) to bourgeois politics ... politics 
 tradunionist is the general aspiration of all workers ad 
 obtain direct measures against the ailments proper to the state of the 
 their condition, but not yet suitable to suppress this condition, 
 that is, to destroy the submission of work to capital ... 
 So, there is politics and political ... ".
 <p>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Economists 
 “By fully recognizing the growing political struggle 
 spontaneously from the same worker movement (or rather the 
 claims and political aspirations of the workers) ... refuse 
 Absolutely to independently elaborate a policy ... specifies 
 who responds to the tasks of socialism and current conditions ", 
 of the country and the class struggle.
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Lenin continuing 
 In the examination of other forms of economism, he takes in 
 consideration those who give much weight to the spontaneous struggle of 
 workers, who of course when he begins to wake up grabs the first 
 means of struggle that happen, but clearly these first means 
 They will be the tradunionists and the first ideology that happens will be 
 Always bourgeois ideology ".
 </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Lenin does not put in 
 discussion this process nor “that the mass worker movement 
 It is a very important phenomenon is something on which there is no discussion. But the 
 question lies in the way of understanding how this movement
  <i>
   It will determine the tasks.
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   There 
 What can be understood in two ways, or in the sense of the cult of the 
 spontaneity of this movement, that is, the reduction of the role 
 of social democracy to pure servility towards the 
 worker movement as such ...,
  </span>
<i>
   or
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   in the sense that the mass movement places us
  </span>
<i>
   new
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   assignments 
 Theoretical, political, organizational much more complex ... ".
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   Lenin 
 continues examining how economists, even when they do 
 right political statements, always translate them into forms of 
 adaptation to the existing movement; and contrasts with them 
 The organization for political struggle. And takes into consideration 
 Some aspects of this position of economists.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   In 
 A note is written: “The theory of stadiums, or shy theory 
 Zig-Zag, it is expressed as follows: common political claims ... 
 However, they must correspond in the early days to the experience that a 
 determined layer of workers has obtained from the economic struggle. 
 Only on the ground of this experience can it be and must 
 undertake political agitation ".
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   AND 
 To strengthen this concept, economists argue: “Which 
 Social Democrat does not know that according to Marx and Engels' doctrine 
 The economic interests of the individual classes perform a function 
 decisive in history and that,
  </span>
<i>
   consequently
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   , 
 In particular, the struggle of the proletariat for his interests 
 economic must have a primary meaning for its development of 
 class and the emancipator struggle? ".
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   Lenin 
 Reply: “This is consequently absolutely inappropriate. From the 
 the fact that economic interests perform a decisive function not
  </span>
<i>
   derives at all
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   no 
 consequence on the primary meaning of the economic struggle (= 
 union), because the most essential "decisive" interests 
 classes can be satisfied
  </span>
<i>
   only
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   with radical transformations
  </span>
<i>
   policies
  </i>
<span style="font-style: normal;">
   in general; in particular, the fundamental economic interest of 
 proletariat can only be satisfied through a revolution 
 policy that replaces the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie 
 of the proletariat ".

  And the "security forces" after Parliament has decided to postpone the presidential elections, supporting the unilateral announcement that took place on February 4 by current President Macky Sall, just before the electoral campaign began. According to the newspaper's information, at least three protesters have been killed by the "security forces." The youngest of them was 16, who was shot in the head. The Senegalese state has also cut the Internet to impose greater censorship.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8a5337d496e143095cd51e6bb0243575">
  Senegal is considered a "stable" country, which has a "long tradition of democracy and respect for human rights" by imperialists. However, before postponing the elections, Macky Sall's rivals had beaten with criminal and imprisonment accusations. His main rival, Ousmane Sonko, was accused of rape, among other things, an allegation that according to his supporters has been politically motivated. In 2021 struggles began in which at least 13 people were shot and killed by the riot police. Sonko is still being arrested under the “corruption of minors and insurrection incitement” charges despite having been acquitted of rape charges. Many journalists and activists
  <a href="https://allafrica.com/stories/202402090275.html">
   They have been arrested
  </a>
  for informing about the restrictions that have been applied to Sonko and his party. Of course, Sonko is only a representative of a different section of the ruling classes and there is no doubt that in power he would have acted ruthlessly to continue serving the interests of his imperialist masters.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f7b4177946883030706eda12b0ec8830">
  The right to vote and "free elections" are considered fundamental ideal of bourgeois democracy, and postpone the elections unilaterally by the president, which is not allowed to continue in power after having been since 2012, it is a clear violation of it. Despite this, the postponement of the elections is within the institutional framework of the Senegalese state, as an American political scientist has pointed out. Sall simply
  <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/3/senegals-macky-sall-postpones-presidential-election">
   has signed a cancellation decree
  </a>
  of the measure of November 2023 which defined the date of the elections. The reason he has declared is that there were problems with the list of candidacies, of which some of their rival candidates have been excluded, and has called to maintain the "national dialogue" to "create conditions for inclusive, free and transparent elections in a Pacific and reconciled Senegal. ” This shows the rot of bureaucratic capitalism and the illusory nature of demoliberal rights.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-418ad7909568408f64c14e23b06d9226">
  The Imperialists have raised concerns about the fight in Senegal, which has been a relatively stable country in the Sahel region, in which multiple military blows have taken place in recent years. They have been published
  <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/un-raises-alarm-over-escalating-tensions-in-senegal-after-election-delay/ar-BB1ig4vU">
   a series
  </a>
  of cynical statements. For example, the instrument dominated by American imperialism, UN, has condemned the violations of "human rights" committed by the riot police and called to the Government to make the "national dialogue" "inclusive." French imperialism has called the police to use violence in a "proportionate" way against the protesters and has expected the elections to be held soon. American imperialism has expressed its "deep concern" about the situation.
 </p>
<p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7f35f83e68f3cef18255fb703d2797f1">
  What is expressed in the protests is the demand of the people of Senegal for democratic rights and for changing their conditions, a large number of protesters being young, who are angry with their life of suffering offered by bureaucratic capitalism. At the same time, there are forces that try to turn the fight into an electoral struggle, or turn the fight into peaceful protest marches, to preserve this order of oppression with the blood of the people.

     The Colombia Plan for the masses of our country brought with it the greatest number of displaced in history, a strong repression of the popular and student movement, the increase in massacres against the masses and the great strengthening of paramilitarism.

     From the government of Juan Manuel Santos in 2015, a series of permits and constructions are carried out on the Gorgona Island, in the municipality of Guapi, department of Cauca to build a guide substation financed by the United States International Anti -Narcotics Assistance Office. The historical excuse of Yankee imperialism to gain greater military control of our nation is the war against drug trafficking. The same justification used in 1999 with the implementation of Plan Colombia, which implied financing of more than 10,000 million dollars, the greatest military financial support after the one granted to Israel.
    </span>
</span>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6716029ac45e44af8646bcbbb3fdbc3c" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0px;">

     The island has a key geostrategic position, it served much of the last century as a marketing and supply zone between Panama and Peru. Even so, US military forces say it is a necessity to control the island because 37% of coca cargo is transported annually.
    </span>
</span>
</p>
<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4c40b2b4fc1414976da72f5e1ff6bc83" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0px;">
<span>
<span>
     They plan the construction of a 170 -meter spring, a tower with a surveillance radar at the highest point of the island, a tank to store 5,000 gallons of fuel and 3 buildings to accommodate the military and high controls of the army. In 2019 they finished the construction of the surveillance tower and in 2022, the Petro government already possessed, began the construction of the buildings and the fuel tank.
    </span>
</span>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-4bdddef0e58d65cac1fac2f54a41c357" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0px;">
<span>
<span>
     The indigenous communities of Guapi mobilized since 2015 against this project because it represented a great ecological threat to the great biodiversity that exists on the island and in that sense, for the work of the population of the area that are mostly dedicated to fishing . In addition, communities have warned a possible displacement of this sector with the excuse of United States military security; This happened on October 2 that while the island was closed and quarantically placed by an alleged avian flu, a helicopter with US personalities landed, next to the coast guard commander Javier Bermúdez and the head of the Gorgona National Park that stayed for 4 hours for 4 hours and analyzed the constructions made. This complaint was made by organizations of Guapi and Bazan.
    </span>
</span>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8a3b73f2b94c2f8059b13ae189b6399d" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0px;">
<span>
<span>
     For the protests and complaints made by the communities, Petro was pushed to Pausar the project in February 2023.
    </span>
</span>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f3c2e11e3886ef888160b68c13ad97ec" style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0px;">
<span>
<span>
     The Petro government has positioned itself as the most environmentalist in the continent, especially currently in the midst of the fires generated by the phenomenon of the child and the global climatic crisis generated by imperialism. However, it has not been clear about the claims of the indigenous peoples of Guapi that have been denouncing the ecological risk that represents the construction of the Yankee military base for more than 9 years. In fact, on January 24 he was in the municipality where he is able to notice the settlers claiming the situation with the Gorgona Island and demanding that they return their territory while Gustavo Petro hurries their withdrawal from the place.

     That is the Lacayo's character of the opportunistic government that serves as a collaborator with Yankee imperialism to develop, strengthen and specify its greater control plans of our country by strengthening the semicolonial character of our society and deepening greater repression, displacement and suffering of the masses in areas in areas where the American army develops its reactionary plans.

  Several experiments from the Valley Campus of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in the Agronomy neighborhood, were lost after a blackout affect the educational institution on February 12 and 13. The episode occurred after the breakdown of cables and caused $ 200 million damage to the university, making clear the level of neglect of the State Electric Energy Company (CEEE) with the state's population. Since 2021 the company has been collecting complaints of incompetence to deal with the electrical problems of the population. In January this year, more than 1 and a half million people were out of power, which took weeks to be restored by CEEE. For nine days, residents of
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/rs-moradores-protestam-contra-falta-de-energia-eletrica-e-danos-do-temporal/">
   Porto Alegre
  </a>
  They protested against the company's management and the government's decision to have privatized electricity.
 </p>
<p>
  The blackout happened around 2:30 pm on 12/02 and the situation only returned to normal at 7 pm on the next day, after 30 hours of Blecaut. Dozens of university research were affected or completely destroyed. More than 100 birds died due to the intense heat from the lack of air conditioning in a zootechnical laboratory that hosts animal nutrition research. In addition to this research, ice samples collected in Antarctica were almost lost, while equipment of up to R $ 700 thousand was impaired.
 </p>
<p>
  The responsibility of what happened directly on CEEE, and adds as another case of neglect accumulated by the company since its privatization in 2021. In the course of new management, former technical teams of the company have been fired and replaced by new ones, mostly outsourced. Exploitation registered with the company, which was accused this year for mistreatment and dismissals without payment of contractual termination, also affects the quality of the service provided to the people. In addition, the company was also involved this year in a scandal after falsifying technical training certificates of its employees.

  , on February 10, military police broke into the Gleba Campina, in the Vilela community, in Junco do Maranhão, and tried to arrest peasants who worked in the lots. The action was all done on duty and accompanied by local landowners accused of grabbing, particularly Claudemir Moreira, known as "Bill".
 </p>
<p>
  The action took place around 1 pm, when six strongly armed police with rifles and pistols invaded the plot to try to hold the arrest. The comosolute organization note describes that:
 </p>
<p>
  “Scandalously, the police were accompanied by the“ manager ”of the farm, Claudemir Moreira, the“ Bill ”: subject that is appointed by the gunmen, in a statement collected by the Civil Police, as one of the principals of the armed militia headed by Adilson Secco, which has destroyed the improvements of the peasants in the Campina Gleba, ”says the document.
 </p>
<p>
  After not being able to arrest the peasants, the police tried to intimidate the residents of the region with threats so that they "do not return to the plot." According to the activists, the attempted intimidation of the peasants is a response to the growing mobilization in the region, expressed in the Great Peasant Assembly held on 02/04, where the community reaffirmed the path of struggle.

  On February 9, parents and guardians of students at Allan Kardec Municipal School, located in the East Zone of Manaus, held a demonstration in front of the College to denounce the Secretariat of Education (Semed) for removing, in an autocratic way, the current director from school. The case highlights the complete absence of democracy in Amazonian school institutions, where school management are directed by political indications of shift managers.
 </p>
<p>
  During the act, with speeches and posters, residents charged plausible justifications for the exchange of manager, denounced the constant lack of vacancies at school and claim accessibility to children with disabilities. For Deliane, mother of a student heard by the Radar Amazonian portal, director Cristiane do Nascimento would be doing a great job.
 </p>
<p>
  “We know the calamity that is in our neighborhood, we are asking here that we have an answer from why, that the director is leaving and the faults of vacancies (…). We can't leave it, she was doing a great job, ”she says.

<p>
  The case, however, is not the first in the city of Manaus. Also in May 2023, hundreds of students, parents and guardians from the Santo Antônio neighborhood, in the west of the city, held a major demonstration in front of General Aristide Barreto Municipal School.
 </p>
<p>
  With posters saying:
  <strong>
   We want our manager back
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   Persecution not
  </strong>
  e
  <strong>
   Leave our school in peace
  </strong>
  , the masses accused the secretary of education, Dulce Almeida, to exonerate the then school manager, Patrícia Cerquilho, for reasons of political persecution, since the professional had been making public criticism of Semed's policies.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Coronelismo in Amazonian education
 </h4>
<p>
  It is important to note here that the educational policy of Amazonas is one of the pillars of negotiation of the political game of the old state. Following a coronalist logic, successive mayors and governors use the direction of schools to exchange favors and favor allies, playing with the right to quality education for large masses.
 </p>
<p>
  To Professor Lambert, leader of the Manaus Teachers and Pedagogues Union (Asprom Sindical)
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  , this policy of management political sponsorship directly interferes with the quality of public education.
 </p>
<p>
  “It is notorious that public school managers, the main commitment they have, when they are placed in the school administrations, is to realize the school as an electoral corral of that politician who is sponsoring him. So, the main criterion for the indication of these names is that it is able to gain the confidence (and consequently the votes) of the school community, the parents of students and adult students, ”he says.
 </p>
<p>
  Regarding the direct consequences of this type of oligarchic policy, the unionist tells:
 </p>
<p>
  “Of course, many problems that lead to a precariousness of labor relations to those school professionals and also a precariousness of the quality of teaching and the learning of students. The school is at the mercy of political party interests and all the actions that are carried out has the purpose of not improving the quality of education, but the care of the interests of those who are sponsoring ”.
 </p>
<p>
  ASPROM Sindical also takes advantage of the opportunity to highlight one of the defense flags of the teaching category, which is the direct election for school managers.
 </p>
<p>
  Another organization also heard by the correspondent of the
  <strong>
   AND
  </strong>
  , which also uncompromisingly defends the direct election for school managers is the Amazonian executive of Pedagogy students - EXAMPEPE. For Beatriz, activist of the entity, tells us a little about the importance of this struggle:
 </p>
<p>
  “The election of the school principal is one of the elements that can contribute to the exercise of democratic management in education, allowing the community's involvement in the decision -making process about the organization and functioning of the school. This is a comprehensive form of democracy, allowing everyone to actively participate in the selection of this authority. It is an inclusive participation, accessible to all involved. Although it is a challenging goal, it is achievable. ”

  In Belo Horizonte and Contagem, the street blocks of Carnival Minas Gerais performed a series of political activities in support of the Palestinian people during the period of the big national party. On Saturday, a huge Palestinian flag, dozens of meters, was raised by activists from the top of a viaduct, late in the morning, amid the most popular parade of the capital, the "then shines". The image of this flag printed the headlines of the main vehicles of the Minas Gerais press monopoly.
 </p>
<p>
  In several other blocks, flags and Palestinian banners were erected. Tracks against the Genocide of the Palestinian people were also extended by the revelers. Type activities were recorded in blocks like the then plant, calls the liquidator and circulado. The first manifesto of the campaign was signed by 23 blocks.

  Belorizontino Carnival is named one of the largest folks in the country and is estimated that this year more than 5 million revelers gather. According to the Minas Gerais Solidarity Committee to the Palestinian people, in publication for their social networks:
  <em>
   “The presence of the Palestinian flag and oral interventions during the parades has been very well received by the public!”
  </em>
  and even that
  <em>
   "Many curious people ask what is actually happening in Palestine ... They ask stickers, ask how they can help."
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  The committee continues to promote activities requiring the end of genocide, immediate ceasefire and the end of the Zionist occupation. Every day, in 7 de Setembro Square, in the hypercenter of the capital, the Minas Gerais Committee collects signatures demanding the breakdown of Brazilian state relations with “Israel”, distributes leaflets and conversation with the population.

<strong>
   Writing Note:
  </strong>
  We played below an article published in the Colombian News Portal
  <em>
   New democracy
  </em>
  About the advancement of the US imperialist dominance in Colombia from a project, funded by USA, to install a coast guard substation on Gorgona Island.
 </p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>
  The Colombia plan brought with it to the masses of our country the largest number of displaces in history, a fierce repression of the popular and student movement, an increase in massacres against the masses and a great strengthening of paramilitarianism.
 </p>
<p>
  Since the government of Juan Manuel Santos, in 2015, a series of licenses and buildings have advanced on the island of Gorgona, in the municipality of Guapi, Department of Cauca, to build a substation of the coastal guard funded by the International Affairs Office of Law and Law Narcotics of the United States. The historical excuse of Yankee imperialism to obtain greater military control of our nation is the war against drug trafficking. They used the same justification in 1999 with the implementation of the Colombia Plan, which implied a financing of more than 10 billion dolions, the greater military financial support after the granted to Israel.
 </p>
<p>
  The island has a fundamental geostrategic position, serving for much of the last century as a trade and supply zone between Panama and Peru. Still, the Ianques military claim that it is necessary to control the island because 37% of the annual section of Coke passes through it.
 </p>
<p>
  They plan to build a 170 -meter pier, a tower with a surveillance radar at the highest point of the island, a tank to store 5,000 gallons of fuel and 3 buildings to house soldiers and the high command of the army. In 2019, they completed the construction of the Surveillance Tower and, in 2022, after the Petro government, began the construction of the buildings and the fuel tank.
 </p>
<p>
  Guapi indigenous communities have mobilized since 2015 against this project because it represented a great ecological threat to the great biodiversity on the island and, in this sense, for the work of the population of the zone, whose majority is dedicated to fishing. In addition, communities warned of a possible displacement of this sector with the excuse of strategic military security of the United States; This is what happened on October 2, when, while the island was closed and quarantine because of an alleged avian flu, a helicopter landed with a Sobreresa team with a USA team, Coast Guard Commander Javier Bermúdez and the head of Gorgona National Park, which remained for four hours on the island and analyzed the buildings made. This complaint was made by organizations of Guapi and Bazan.
 </p>
<p>
  This is the lacquence of the opportunistic government that serves as a collaborator of US imperialism to develop, strengthen and realize its greater control plans of our country, strengthening the semicolonial character of our society and deepening the repression, displacement and suffering of masses in areas where the US army develops its reactionary plans.

  We denounce the planned police operation to suppress today's students (15/2) in Thessaloniki against the Pierrakakis plan. The presence of the police from the beginning of the march was provocative. It was followed by an attack on the block of student clubs in Hagia Sophia and student arrests !! After the course arrived at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There was an attempt to terrorize students with powerful police forces to encircle the university and invade the courtyard of Philosophy where he began coordinating General Assemblies at the occupied school.

  The MAT also moved to Law, the AUTH Library and elsewhere by flying chemicals and chasing students. The government annoyed by the continuation and insistence of the student movement to resist the establishment of private universities and the abolition of public free education, trying to break our demonstrations, occupations and collective processes. Indeed, in view of the submission of the bill to Parliament, the government chooses to demonstrate power. But terrorism will not pass.

 The monumental was the boldness of Picasso's angry response to the question of a German officer in occupied France in 1940, if he was the creator of the flagship table. "No (I), you did it." Similarly, with a host of inadequate, but at the same time fully justified and fair explosion on October 7 in the Schberrot was impressed by the very existence of a stingy state established on a horny homeland and guarded by the most brutal methods. Taking inhumane to such boundaries that until Hitler would feel relic. Another is so unhappy with this Anglo -American state by the current imprisoned - bombarded and former Palestinian owners of its existence. Even if a monk Kafi is left in the martyred soil this year, the conqueror will be anxious.
 <br>
<br>
 Therefore, the excruciating dilemma facing the Nazi leadership of the militarized Israel over time is clear and outrageous. There is a mixture of extensive extermination (raw genocide) and "more lenient" uprooting trial of ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population. Otherwise the foundations will be incessant. Intermediate phase is not meant. The conqueror's oppression dipped will supply endlessly fed. Even with diligent leaders (unfortunately the circumstances were taken and this is only corrected ... on the go) and almost orphaned by the necessary communist gum. Until the tears, lazy, today's or future attempts at the forefront of the indigenous population by the Iron Capitalist descendants of Moses (who replaced the swastika with the pendulum) will ultimately be the most guaranteed inspirer of Nikimos.
 <br>
<br>
 It is not an idealistic belief and a dreamy approach to the certainty of the certainty, often slow, always tiring, painful and violently projected to pace the human race. His overwhelmed pages of his multifaceted course are brightened by the lame flame of the unmistakable spirit, evolutionary law and the unmistakable torque for prosperity.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Verification; This is how slave societies were demolished. Empires and colonials collapsed, nations were liberated, fascism crushed, imperialism was overthrown. They were overthrown by tsar by guaranteeing class emancipation. This finding does not constitute an unmistakable and idealistic daydream of the impossible. It is simply the story itself. Whose inevitable jokes and recovery of flow to the positive obviously the global reaction cannot capture in the nightmarish present despite its hysterical efforts. Indeed, stating its ending and anchoring at the existing stage of the wrongdoing. Of the third world misery of the masses and the constant vertigo of war conflicts with their fear of fear of a thermal holocaust.
 <br/>
<br/>
 So it does not seek the advice or much more the approval of any theoretical luminous and hierarchy of the system to the struggle of the peoples to inflate and relieve their immediate suffering. While forging the perspective of definitive redemption and passing (and undermining) the current adverse class weigh. Nor did the various European strikers and farmers be faint in front of the "omnipotence of the bosses. The orders were heard from the mature need of bold defense of their interests. Similar is a vital destiny is the heroic armed Palestinian uprising, which is daily confused with the horror of reality on the planetary milestone of Gaza.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Continuously, the exacerbated, exalted and multifaceted crisis of the world capitalist-imperialist, in turn, puts an urgent dilemma in the working class and the peoples of the world: starvation, disgust, slavery and threat of nuclear holocaust; Or the neutralization of this historic gangrene and the accompanying salvation? In some and perhaps not long -term response, it no longer simply determines the dignity and bliss of the masses. But on the eve of mankind on the face of the earth and the avoidance of chaos.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the drowning in rivers of innocent blood there in the heart of the Middle East, the chained right is once again boring. More rushing, because his stranger becomes unbearable. Certainly burdened with an oak weaknesses, but stunned on the steel will for two concepts, which are difficult to break down. The shutdown of American imperialism based on the elbows (despite the latest pretense, rhetorical, timid and posthumous distancing of) fascist yoke and now clearly the survival of the oppressed in their trampled land.
 <br/>
<br/>

  Ecumenical Lighthouse Palestine

<br/>
<br/>
 The heart of mankind pulses on the night (and days) of Bartholomew in Mesolongi, Gaza. A people are killed (by tens of thousands), because "they want to say it is less". The perpetrator is not only depicted in the face of Zionism and his American pillar. Just nowadays they are pushing the trigger. However, they are stigmatized by numerous globe. Starting with the short -haired Greek starvation and miserable US port with a disproportionate taller grandeur and adventurism. Who assists in the massacre offering land and frigates. Continuing with the barbaric Arabic and Islamic regimes (and past some Palestinian executioners) whose bite -free barking do not reflect their sincere zeal for the unpleasant and hateful prospect of the prosperity of a genuine struggle and a good manner . Concluding in Russian and Chinese imperialism (Europeans are many times bewildered, tolerate and divide) where they leave and hope that their "inactivity" works geopolitically in their favor.
 <br/>
<br/>
 So behind the drama of Gaza lies an entire cluster of criminals and conflicting interests and designs. It condenses, captures and foreshadows the forthcoming tricks and suffering of many peoples or even. Because that's how it feeds, rearrange and perpetuated capitalism and imperialism. With the pain and flesh of the peoples. For about two hundred years, nothing changed in its downfall. In addition to short -lived pauses of "serenity" and alternations in the severity and geographical extent of the conflicts. Until the Red armies crush the last capitalist, the prosperity for the social majorities will be utopian and peace will be shaken by nightmares or suffer from serial rape.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The gangs of the exploiters are justified and dislike (despite the hypocrisy of many) the resistance of the Palestinians. Thorn annoying in their eye. Because it is the brightest symbol and the most indisputable example of the office, that the scourge will react instinctively against its torture.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Middle Eastern strikes travel to the planet. However, he is accompanied by a breathing crush, which permeates the muscles of each devastated. Of the working class, which for crumbs plays the life of the crown letters in employers. Of Africans and Latin Americans, who, although living in rich but looted continents, are starving. Unlucky Iraqi, Yugoslav, Syrollyvians and Ukrainians, whose fate threw them between the Complexes of imperialist competitions. Mourning millions of their dismembered and charred relatives. Any generally released, which generously receives the hopeless consequences of the existential extension of a rotten, bankrupt, vandal system.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the Palestinian tragedy, the peoples detect gentle aspects of their own tests. By admiring the steel vigor and determination of the Palestinians, trust in their own fist emerges. On the contrary, in the face of Israel they recognize signs of their own tyrants.
 <br/>
<br/>
 This crush cracks the despair and encourages. It flashes the cowardly, bent -hearted reasoning. Demonstrating the lame impulse of man even in the most rugged circumstances and in the midst of the darker horizon to open the scratches of optimism. To fight for what he deserves and to sail that he crushes him.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Yes true. We give courage and strengthen the Palestinians with our solidarity. More fertile when we are opposed to converting our country into a warprint of the slayers. At the same time, however, we draw so much inspiration and encouragement. We are taught the palpitation and carving of the outlet to cancel our own paths.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Of course, Zionist criminals forget in the vertigo of overthrowing a ... "detailed" rule. The strange tree of freedom, the more it is watered with blood, the more it reaps ...
 <br/>
<br/>
 Petsas, as a cynical bearer of the rule of the rulers, advised the people to adapt to the new conditions, otherwise he would die. That is, to succumb to the trap of the system by planting and unhappy. On the other hand, their politics- just as Israel unintentionally unleashes armed uprising- outscor the people in the awareness of the necessity, that they will be hungry and dying if it does not flood the paths of confrontation.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Students and farmers are already becoming a bit of "Palestinians". They resist, they fight. Stumbling too, in turn in their own various deficits. An important of these is the incomplete understanding of the common origin of crushing policy on bread, good care, free public education, unmistakable trade unionism, uninterrupted capacity to claim nationalism, myriad equipment fever and involvement in war. And when the understanding is lagging behind, the conjunction of the struggle fronts is fatal.
 <br/>
<br/>
 If it is still mediated and acts on the movement one left of the truce with the system, the resistance of the below is severely suffering. Within four months Israel's US war machine has transformed into ruins the largest - as they say correctly - prison on the planet. Not to release the prisoners, but to destroy them. He set up 30,000 souls. Number of non -negligible. Number of sparact, outrageous. Number that concerns no mice loss. But how harmonized with the size of the massacre was the Communist in front of her organized condemnation on the streets of mobilization? So let's answer the shameful count of four -month gatherings and demonstrations, which were decided in the big cities. Especially in the last period of unacceptable silence-inaction and addiction to macabre announcement by the news of the daily hills by the victims.
 <br/>
<br/>
 There is an invasion of the Rafa of the crowded land of about one and a half million refugees. The Zionist Macquariers are self -denial when urged civilians to move to this supposedly safe refuge, to escape the inquisitive leveling of the northern part of Gaza. The destruction of a new Asia Minor Smyrna is being prepared. The descendants of survivors from the Auschwitz camp set up a new crematorium.
 <br/>
<br/>
 What does he have to prioritize as a duty of direct, dynamic and mass complaint of this abominable aggressive choice of the Jewish staff? Humanitarian, internationalist, anti -imperialist, anti -fascist or anti -war debt? But all together. There is no distinction. On the contrary, the separation arises between the Pharisee forces that claim to be friends and supporters of the Palestinian struggle (while deliberately omitted) and those who strive for the maximum.

 Colleagues, colleagues,
 <p>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   These days, in the context of Evaluation 2023, we are called upon to complete the "Group Pulse". Simply put,
   <span style="color: #990000;">
<b>
     To evaluate our bosses compulsory and branded and to "give" our colleagues
    </b>
</span>
   Evaluating whether our work environment has "courtesy and positive mood" and "if it is constantly trying".
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   In 
  He then follows a "discussion" with the boss. For this step the 
 Ministry has detailed, in a degree of manipulation, instructions that start 
 by how the boss 'will communicate vision' (which vision 
 ?), How will he 'draw the employee's view of the operation of 
 Organic Unit "in terms of" cooperation and relationship with their 
 rests', gives examples and specific jokes about how to 
 keep a 'friendly climate' in the discussion, 'to' start with warm 
 Reception », Management Instructions of any reaction with specific 
 phrases and examples. And the funniest, gives recommendation to finish the 
  discussion with "a positive comment or an encouraging observation". All these 
  at least, ridiculously, describe, ultimately,
   <b>
<span style="color: #990000;">
     a completely guided and manipulated process
    </span>
</b>
   in which, in fact, the boss has already received knowledge of 
 evaluation made by his employee, since his own 
 The deadline expires on 29/2 and ours on 26/2.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   And 
  After this set-up proced 
 Even our plans, as to whether we want to promote, to 
 We move, to retire, etc. our boss 
 'Evaluate':
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   a. 
  To what extent we are employees with a "improvement capacity" in 9 skills 
 of which only in 3 we may be 'developed' and in 
 at least 6 compulsory 'to grow' and
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   b. 
  To what extent we are employees of 'high performance and potential', where 
 Obviously he will put not because, otherwise, he will have to write 
 a whole descendant and judge his assessment by a committee with 
 Experts of ASEP, the National Transparency Authority, the Law 
 Council. We also remember the dozens of cases of colleagues who 
 They were getting 89 for that very reason. Of course NO automatically leads the 
 Employee in "Learning in the Workplace", "Mentoring, Coaching" ...
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Colleagues, colleagues,
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   Which of us, really, wants to participate in this trap process?
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
<b>
<span style="color: #990000;">
     The 
  System of evaluating-in-placement has been made to us to 
 manipulate, to terrorize us and in no way to 
 help.
    </span>
</b>
   It is a Government's weapon that throws responsibility 
 to a civil servant for whom he only reserves tire hours, 
 Intensification and crumbs.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">
   For these reasons,
   <b>
<span style="color: #990000;">
     your 
  We invite you to participate in the strike-abstinence from the evaluation that has 
 ADEDY and OSSESSDDA announce. We do not fill in the form 
 Group pulse, we do not participate in the discussion. We do not legitimize and not 
  We accept other weights on our backs.

 We let the opportunity to resist this policy, 
 To defend our right to permanent and stable work, to 
 We are fighting for our collective conquests.

  The river of rage has overflowed, the tractors go down the streets, blocks have been set up all over the country with farmers rising against policies that want to destroy them. Breeders, farmers, beekeepers, the whole of the poor and medium -sized peasantry are struggling for their survival. Floods and disasters, prices of their products that are mismatches with production costs and anti -rational policies constantly squeeze farmers' income down. The government announcements and crumbs that the prime minister put in his meeting with them cannot equalize the disaster that thousands of rural households have suffered. Everything shows that these constantly thickens are not for the "price of weapons". There are mobilizations that result from the accumulated indignation of the peasantry. The same indignation is expressed by the farmers of the whole of Europe who are on the road with common problems and joint claims.

  We students who have resolved in a racing orbit must jointly build a common front of resistance with the peasantry and the people to overthrow the policy that is moving a new hit of our rights. Our occupations that continue and our mass demonstrations must meet with blocks and agricultural mobilizations. The government will be even more squeezed when the struggles of students, farmers and workers are coordinated and together fight for their work, crop and studies.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Common problems, common and our enemies:

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br>
</br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  What breaks up, government and ministries respond with terrorism and repression. Matt and wood in the schools, as well as in the farm block, prosecutors for those who close the streets and for those who occupies. The agrarian and disciplinary industry warms its machines once again. The intensity of fascism reveals the panic of the government in front of the new wave of mobilization.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  The attack we receive students and farmers has a common source and this is none other than the policies that serve the interests of the local and foreign capital. They are the policies of the EU and its mechanisms that, with the "European Education" and the OECD, hit our right to studies and with "Common Agricultural Policy" deprive the right of farmers to live by working on their land. We have to confront them!
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br/>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Our only choice is the common struggle with the people, the peasantry and the workers in the struggle against the policies that want to level our rights.

  Tarcísio de Freitas's reactionary government decided on February 14 to reinforce the shield operation,

  , with 400 more military police (PM). So far, the PMs have murdered 20 people and have been reported by home invasions, executions, death threats and changes in police crimes scenes. With the reinforcement, the tendency is for the number of arbitrariness and police murders to increase.

  Shield operations are revenge operations that is clear that it is clear to establish, through the maximum violations of rights and crimes against the people, a climate of terror in the favelas of São Paulo. Since the beginning of the operation, there are several allegations of residents against the military.
 </p>
<p>
  In an interview with
  <a href="https://ponte.org/jovens-com-deficiencia-executados-ameacas-invasao-de-hospital-as-novas-denuncias-sobre-a-operacao-escudo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Journalism Bridge

  , activist Fran l'esraster reported that “there is no day or time to happen. They don't want to know who's inside. So a kick they give at the door of these houses break the door, break everything, because it is stilts. There was a family, which I attended, that the policeman entered the person's house, started turning the whole house and asked the woman: ‘tell this child to shut up, otherwise I will kill you here in front of her’. Children cannot see a police officer who are already beginning to tremble and cry. It is revolting".
 </p>
<p>
  Among the people murdered by the police are the 45 -year -old cans José Marques da Silva, murdered on February 3 and the visually impaired Hildebrando Simão Neto, killed with young Davi Gonçalves Dias, indoors. According to the bridge, all were killed by police from the Ostensive Rounds Battalion Tobias de Aguiar (Route). José was returning to work when he was executed by the route police. Already Hildebrando and David were at home doing coffee. The residence was invaded, the other family members were expelled by the police and the two were murdered in cold blood.
 </p>
<p>
  Other family members denounce that the same
  <em>
   mode of operation
  </em>
  From executions he was repeated in cases such as Leonel Andrade Santos and Jefferson Ramos. Both were murdered together at Morro São Bento in Santos. According to Leonel's mother, interviewed by the bridge, “He first passed the house of a girl he talked about and she herself says that [Jefferson would have said], in 20 minutes, she was just going to get a pizza and back. That was when he climbed with the mullet boy [Leonel]. When I arrived, they [police] already said my son was dead. They didn't let me see my son, pushed me, said, 'don't put your hand on me'. I cried, knelt and did nothing. ”

<p>
  Another relative of Leonel confirmed that the young man was disabled and that he received the benefit of continued benefit, government assistance to people unable to support themselves.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  Changes in crime scenes and invasions to hospitals
 </h4>
<p>
  In addition to the murders, police were accused of tampering with crime scenes and police reports and going to hospitals to intimidate family members of victims who survived.
 </p>
<p>
  According to Cássio Thyone Rosa, a member of the Brazilian Public Security Forum, “PM records are repetitive, speaking of shot, death, drugs and weapons found with suspects. It's a repetition that looks like a ready recipe. ” The suspicion is even greater when seen side by side with the allegations that most of the bodies are taken from the crime scene with the justification that “they were alive,” but they never arrive at the hospital for “dying on the way”. Other victims arrived at the Forensic Medical Institute (IML) without any identification.
 </p>
<p>
  The practice of removing people already killed from the crime scene to prevent expertise and the consequent proof of executions has been systematically committed for decades in the PM, particularly in SP. Reports such as Route 66, by journalist Caco Barcellos, rescue this practice in the corporation until at least the 1970s, over 50 years ago. The report has raised thousands of cases of young shot, taken from the scene already executed or murdered on the way, and delivered to the lifeless hospital or unidentified IML, just as these days. In the reports of occurrence, the same formula applied these days of “confrontations” was repeated, whose only proof were weapons and drugs planted by the police themselves.
 </p>
<p>
  Other victims of the police in the ongoing shield operation report that when survivors, police have gone to hospitals to intimidate shots and family members. The Journalism Bridge repercussions such complaints in São Vicente, where residents of Parque Bitaru neighborhood say police officers went to the hospital where the public servant Juan Ribeiro Araújo is hospitalized to photograph the victim. Juan was shot twice at close range by PMs on 02/09, even unarmed.
 </p>
<p>
  All of these illegalities had already been committed in a phase last year's operation, held between July and August 2023. In all, the operation murdered more than 28 people in 40 days, and was extensively reported by a series of organizations in 40 days. and residents of home invasions, executions and torture practices. A preliminary report from the National Human Rights Council on the same phase of the operation pointed out that police were also, at that time, even medical institutions where they were victims of the military to intimidate family members.
 </p>
<h4 class="wp-block-heading">
  SP government is responsible for crimes against the people
 </h4>
<p>
  In this scenario, the São Paulo government summit stands out for the central responsibility in the crimes against the people. It has been a year since the barbarian crimes of the 2023 shield operation, and no mass investigation with significant results has ran the rows of the PM. On the contrary, since then the operations have been congratulated, fostered and increased by the government. While the phase from July to August left 28 dead in 40 days, the recent operation has left 20 dead in just 13 days, half the total time of the previous one.
 </p>
<p>
  In this week's announcement, in addition to increasing the staff with the recent announcement, Tarcisio has expanded the forces employed in Operation Genocide. Alongside the Route's killers will be the reactionary military of the Special Operations Command (COE) and the Police Special Action Battalion.
 </p>
<p>
  At the end of last week, Tarcisio transferred the São Paulo Public Security Bureau to Baixada Santista. Guilherme Derrite, head of the folder, said he would "supervise the operation closely." The measure was taken after the death of a PM in operations, and nothing was said about the crimes against the people. Days later, with police reinforcement, it was confirmed that the government's trend will not be to reduce rights violations, but to encourage them to the maximum in the bloodthirsty operation of revenge operations. In the course of the operation, Derrite was also accused of hiding police reports of organizations that wanted to investigate the violations of the PM.

   During the night of Sunday, 11 to Monday, February 12, the steps of 
 The staircase on rue Sainte Marie des Terreaux, in Lyon, were 
 repainted in the colors of Palestine, to visibility the horror of 
 genocide practiced by the Israeli occupation army. Six activists 
 were taken to the fact and put into police custody and three underwent 
 immediate searches (which is illegal, because the rules of 
  police custody normally do not apply to this kind of offense). A

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The economy of German imperialism is in a recession, in other words, in an economic crisis as part and expression of the general crisis of imperialism. This is noticeable in many places and, interestingly, now in the number of unemployment. The whole thing is interesting because "actually" in the FRG is a big shortage of skilled workers or and that is the more correct version, a great general shortage of workers. In addition, it should be said that this deficiency, firstly, has always put it in the foreground in the media, but secondly also has to do a lot with the increasingly poorer working conditions and the intensification and extension of exploitation, which above all of the youth and young adults are particularly rejected.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Employment Agency in Hesse relativizes unemployment to 5.6 percent with expiring employment contracts of the Christmas business and the end of the year.
  <a href="https://www.hessenschau.de/wirtschaft/steigende-arbeitslosigkeit-in-hessen-ein-ende-der-krise-ist-nicht-in-sicht-v1,arbeitslose-konjunktur-unternehmen-hessen-100.html">
   However, the article of the Hessenschau confirms that this has been the highest quota for unemployment for years, with the exception of the Corona year 2021, but the numbers were lower in front of it. The free vacancies on the job market have also decreased as they have not been in years.
  </a>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  According to a survey by the Hessian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one reason for these increasing unemployment and lower job offers are the evaluation of the future prospects by work buyers. 32 percent of the companies surveyed say that the economic situation becomes even worse, 56 percent say that it stays as (bad) as it is and only 12 percent believe in improving the economic situation in the future.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Overall, the bourgeoisie in Hesse has a realistic, that is, pessimistic view of its economic future. This is probably a struggle to the current unemployment. For example, 90 % of the companies surveyed by the Hessian Chamber of Commerce and Industry do not want to hire new employees in the future. 25 percent even plan to dismiss workers for economic reasons and no longer extend expiring contracts.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  According to the capitalists, concrete reasons for the recruitment of personnel, among other things, the lack of order situation, the declining private consumption due to inflation and war in Ukraine. This entire crisis constellation and recession means that the companies make more losses and that the company's equity is shrinking in contrast to debt (debts). This means that the proportion of the profit achieved that is safe with the company remains less and they are increasingly on uncertain legs because the proportion of debt in debt becomes more in relation. This in turn leads the companies to be "naked" when deducting the debt and have less credit rating in current and future creditors to get further debt.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In practice, for example, this means, for example, that a company whose equity may shrink less loans in relation to debt, because one's own security is also being able to really repay these loans. However, it also means that banks are less inclined to grant the company to make credit to make necessary investments that would allow the company to either renew the means of production or to buy more means of production in order to be able to manufacture better or more goods. In the capitalist crisis dynamics, this leads to the fact that the capitalists destroy productive forces in the form of workplaces in an attempt to stabilize equity and thus also the company's creditworthiness.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  German imperialism and its capitalists are in the crisis and know that. In the future, the economic situation will not get better and much more workers will probably be unemployed. These upheavals must have the revolutionaries in their heads and the undoubtedly developing battles of those who fight for their jobs as well as those who have lost their jobs organize and lead to deepening the crisis of German imperialism even more.

  The assets of our reporter Ertan Çıta were frozen.
 </p>
<p>
  According to the decision published in the Official Gazette by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance, the assets of 11 people in Turkey were frozen.
 </p>
<p>
  The assets of our reporter Ertan Çıta, who was released on January 26 after four months of captivity, were frozen. In the published decision, it was seen that in addition to Çıta, the assets of Mehmet Güvel, one of the TAYAD, who was arrested on February 9, were also frozen.
 </p>
<p>
  Ertan Çıta will object to the decision in question.

<em>
   We publish a statement by the CASR that we have received.
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  After talks failed between farmers and the government this morning “Kisan Mazdoor morcha” started their Delhi Challo March to make the Modi government remember its promises regarding farmers’ demands which are not fulfilled by the Indian state.
 </p>
<p>
  The Brahmanical Hindutva Fascist state was fully prepared and weaponised even before the farmers started the agitation, shutting the internet many districts in haryana and farmers leaders, some youtuber Twitter account also withheld and had fenced the state borders using concrete barricades and sharp nails which made it seem like an international border between two countries. They didn’t only use drones to tear gas protesters, but also pellet guns were used by police and other armed forces during the protest. Many farmers were brutally injured and hospitalized. The police are using drones made by Drone Imaging and Information Service of Haryana Limited (DRIISHYA), a public limited company incorporated in 2021 under the pretense of surveying horticulture and agriculture crops.
 </p>
<p>
  The brutally suppression of the farmers movement cannot be seen in isolation as across India various places protest are being treated as terrorist activities by the Indian state and to deal with these protest they are beating protestors and imprisoning them to implicate them in false cases, if these methods are not working the state is using aerial bombing as a means in far of forest areas in Bastar to silence the people ‘s struggle who are fighting for the protection of their own democratic rights.
 </p>
<p>
  Delhi which is the capital also has the same situation where dissent is not allowed and people are stopped from expressing their opinions, permission is canceled by the police under the pretense of a law and order situation and other vague reasons which are totally baseless. Political assertion of the farmers, who are not allowed to enter Delhi by the fascist state trying to stop their political expression and raise their own reasonable demands. Both these situations are the same and both things are correlated with democratic rights struggles in India. This is not only a protest,but a process of reclaiming democratic spaces which are not only closed for Delhi ‘s civil society, but also for farmers.
 </p>
<p>
  India has a brutal history of suppressing various peasant struggles across India. In the farmers movement of 2020-2021,when they came to Delhi more than 800 farmers lost their lives because of the arrogance and ignorance of the Government.
 </p>
<p>
  CASR strongly condemns the brutal repression of the farmers’ protest by the fascist state to crush the political assertion of farmers’ movement and demands that all barricades be immediately removed and the Mazdoor Kisan Morcha be allowed to show their dissent.

  In Toulouse, on the afternoon of Wednesday February 7, residents of Grand Mirail (Reynerie, Bellefontaine, la Faourette, etc.) met on the large Place Abbal in a friendly atmosphere to continue their fight against the problems of heating. They were joined by members of the “Handi Social Ascenseurs” group, which demands the rehabilitation of elevators in working-class neighborhoods and improved accessibility in general.
 </p>
<p>
  A re-contextualizing speech on the situation was given by a member of the CPES, a speech applauded by those present. At the same time, Gaëtan Cognard, the “neighborhood mayor” (in reality, one of the service of Jean-Luc Moudenc, the mayor of Toulouse) wanted to organize a meeting with “the residents” of the Résidence du Lac, in a community room on the edge of Lake Reynerie. In reality, it was just going to be a quiet discussion between owners and residents on security issues which would allow the real problems to be put aside (this building was also affected by heating problems).

  The gathering marched to the room in question, and the owners were surprised and made very uncomfortable. They first tried to prevent the residents from returning, but faced with the number (a little more than 30 people) and their determination, they had no other choice but to let them return.

  After more than 20 minutes, Gaëtan Cognard arrived at the meeting late, and furthermore told us that he had “a train to catch” and that he could not stay long. Such contempt!
 </p>
<p>
  For around thirty minutes, the mobilized residents tried to obtain a position from him on the heating problems but also on the questions of elevators and the demolitions of buildings. Like a good opportunist, he chattered without taking a position, saying that he was going to organize a “discussion”. Unfortunately for him, people don’t want words but actions. He was also asked several times what he had put in place since his years in management to counter recurring heating problems, to which he was unable to answer.
 </p>
<p>
  In the end, the residents did not have an answer to their questions and demands, and decided to leave the place with determination, deciding to move up a gear. They promised the elected Macronist that there would be more and more of them, before leaving with their heads held high. Watch the video of the confrontation of the opportunist by the residents:

  On Monday 
 12/2, Tele-Expression Day for many parts of the NCSR, the administrative staff 
 of the School, after their decision by the General Assembly of the Association 
 them, made a symbolic exclusion in the Center of Operation and Management 
 Network for one hour, interrupting the exams before they even start.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  After 
 Decision of the Rector, started SAD to the members of the Board of Directors of the Association 
 Administrative Officers of the NCSR, the Bureau of the Assembly that took the 
 and two of the members of the CS of the Federation of Administrative Officers 
 of HEIs who are employees in the NCSR.

 The highlight of all this terrorism campaign was the immediate routing

  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Is 
 clear that we are talking about a vengeance. It is unacceptable to talk about 
 SAD and, let alone for redundancies of administrative staff. Is indicative 
 After all, it has never become the dismissal of a public employee for the 
 His trade union action.
  <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Constitutes 
 also another proof of how important they are to the system in 
 Bumping of occupations, the tele-extensions. That will not tolerate any dispute 
 not even from such symbolic actions. He has also shown the 
 Corresponding hatred to the e -learning against student occupations.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">

 I have been in

 It divides.

</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  They want to 
 keep students separated from workers (as it was shown by 
 the provocative presence of police forces on Monday's march), with fear 
 not to constitute a single folk and youth movement, which will break the 
 generalized terrorism and will overturn the plans of government and 
 system to continue crushing our rights.
  <o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  This should not 
 to pass! Students and workers to find ourselves against their plans for 
 Undermining our struggles, redundancies and disciplinarys!

  News Center | 15.02.2024 | The Middle East Hell .. A geography in which the imperialist bandits turn into a blood lake under the leadership of Zionist Israel. The geography in which collaborative dictators close their eyes for the sake of the profit of the persecution and genocide of the tyrants of the tyrants. The geography of war, blood, tears, plundering nature, and migration. On Sunday, February 25, let's meet at Darmstadt in an interview with Atik Co -Chairman Süleyman Gürcan and researcher Volkan Yaraşır, „Palestinian Reality in the Spec of the Middle East“.

   First, a massive act was developed and marches at the Bariloche Civic Center in front of the Municipal Palace with more than 400 people. Raúl Rajneri, secretary of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Río Negro, took the floor and said: “These rulers we have get used to treating Lewis as a friend. The English usurpan the Falkland Islands, they want to seize our territory in Antarctica. ”
  </p>
<p>
   In addition, as he held eight years ago since the first day in claim of sovereignty, Rajneri stated: “Here in Lake Escondid We are here to defend our Argentine territory. ”
  </p>
<p>
   "With this new march we are going to build the new national strike that allows us to discourage not only hidden lake, but to all the landowners of our country," said the general secretary of the National ATE and the Autonomous CTA Río Negro, Rodolfo Aguiar.
  </p>
<p>
   At noon, the column departed in groups to Foyel, 50 kilometers south, at the entrance of the Tacuifi road, blocked access to the hidden lake, still usurped by English Joe Lewis.
  </p>
<p>
   After eight years of tireless struggle and several judicial failures in favor of the people, the road was closed with a fence and the Government of Río Negro through the security forces, protect again abroad. The protesters again threw stones and received aggressions from the local ducks that take care of Lewis's interests. Fortunately there were no injuries.
  </p>
<p>
   This year's march has as prelude to the journey through the mountain that undertook a group of 24 people from different organizations in the country, who walked to Lake Sovereignty, but could not advance more due to the conditions of impassability of the path.
  </p>
<p>
   The day was precisely on February 14, the day in which the fifth anniversary of the death of our beloved Secretary General of the PCR, Otto Vargas was fulfilled. In his native province, we honor him on the street, in the struggle to recover ours on the way to the National and Social Liberation Revolution, socialism and communism; for those who he dedicated his life.
