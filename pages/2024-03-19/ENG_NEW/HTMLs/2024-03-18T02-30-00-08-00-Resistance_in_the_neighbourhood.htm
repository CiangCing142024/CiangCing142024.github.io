  March 21st has a double importance for the struggle of the Palestinian people.
  <br/>
 </b>
 <br/>
 Is for the Palestinian people the
 <b>
  Honor Day (Memory of Al-Karama Battle)
 </b>
 , a day that Palestinian fighters in Jordan in 1968 faced
 <b>
  victoriously
 </b>
 parts of the Zionist occupation army.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 At the same time as it is the World Day Against Racism, it invites us to underline the fair struggle of the Palestine people against
 <b>
  aparthed
 </b>
 which has imposed the Zionist state of Israel for over seven decades. A regime that in recent years has escalated the policy of racial divisions at the expense of Palestinians and Arabs throughout historical Palestine.

  More than five months have passed since the invasion of Zionist Israel's occupation troops into the witness Gaza. The dead are more than 30,000, most of them women and children, and the injured are over 72,000. The lives of the residents of the Gaza Strip is now threatened not only by the thousands of Zionist bombs but also by hunger and illness.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The Zionist state of Israel continues to threaten to invade Rafa, South Gaza, which have fled more than 1.2 million displaced Palestinians from the North. Such a move will mean an indescribable blood bath and at the same time it is a raw blackmail to the Palestinian people to make the "final solution" practice: ethnic cleansing and mass displacement of the Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Israel escalates tension with both Lebanon and Syria. The same is the aggressive-war-war policy of the US-NATO-EU in the Red Sea and against Yemen, after the Hamas and Iranian executives of the Zionists. The whole area is at the risk of a broader ignition.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The ND government and all bourgeois parties (SYRIZA, PASOK, etc.) openly support the slaughter of the Palestinians by the US-Israel murderers. They turn the country into a NATO and Israeli base. They upgrade their involvement in the slaughter, sending frigate to the Red Sea, under the leadership of both the US and the EU. This policy brings us closer to the whirlpool of war, while in stark contrast to the feelings of solidarity with the people's solidarity. We for Palestine! That is why the ND government It intensifies the repression on the fighters who defend the Palestinian resistance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Our people must demand to stop any involvement of the country in the slaughter of the Palestinian people.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  To oppose the policy of equipment. This policy of equipment, drags him into the war plans of the imperialists and makes the country complicit in the Zionist slaughter. He also loads him with other unbearable burdens which, in combination with the policies of precision and austerity, immerses him in poverty and poverty. To claim with mass races in wage-pensions, and to defend his rights to health, education, social security that are brutally hit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   We continue our solidarity with the brave people of Palestine. We declare our sympathy in the struggle of the people of Palestine for a leather and independent homeland.
  </b>
  We call for the immediate help of Greek hospitals to care for injured Palestinian children. We contribute with all our strengths to form
  <b>
   mass anti -war, anti -imperialist
  </b>
  Front struggle that will oppose the policy of the ND government, the ruling class and the US/NATO/EU imperialist.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>
   We call on all the associations and clubs of the city to give the present to the rally - demonstration, thereby showing their solidarity in the fair struggle of the Palestinian people!
