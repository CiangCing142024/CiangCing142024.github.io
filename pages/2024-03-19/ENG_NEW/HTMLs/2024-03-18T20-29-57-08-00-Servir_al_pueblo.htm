  The president of the Generalitat Pere Aragon√®s announced last Wednesday, March 13 that the regional elections were ahead of May 12. What should be the opinion of the revolutionaries about it? With this opinion article we intend to clarify some fundamental issues.

   The matches of the Catalan bourgeoisie have betrayed the proletariat and Catalan people again and again

  The Torrent of Mobilization and Fury of the Catalan National Liberation Movement, whose qualitative leap we saw on October 1, 2017 with the realization of the referendum declared illegal by the Spanish State -and its subsequent repression -has not led to anything. We must get lesson from what happened.

   "Luckily ours govern and not the PP and Vox," they say in the TV3 gatherings. The reality is that ERC, Junts and PSC govern exactly the same as PSOE, PP and VOX. Catalan bourgeois politicians are class enemies of the proletariat and enemies of the people. They seek independence only for their economic interests, do not hesitate to crush the proletariat and give them absolutely the same the Catalan language and culture.
  </p>

   <strong>
    The National Liberation Movement before the crossroads:
    <br/>
    Follow the bourgeois path or proletarian road?
   </strong>
  </h2>
  <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b50deeac92c3cd45ce1dff5a065876ef">
   There are two paths in the Catalan National Liberation Movement: the bourgeois road and the proletarian road. The two paths are completely different in class interests, in method and objectives.
  </p>
  <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-5446e47377089b12dcf6a687b6d4a2a1">
   The bourgeois road serves the Catalan bourgeoisie, who seeks the independence of Catalonia of the Spanish State to become imperialist, continue oppressing her own people and make the leap to oppress other peoples of the world. The bourgeois path keeps the proletariat and the people in poverty, as they have done for centuries. Price rise and IPC increase, labor exploitation, rise in rentals, evictions and police violence, etc. Catalan bourgeois politicians in Barcelona have ruled in the same way as Spanish bourgeois politicians in Madrid. The bourgeois road urges the masses to participate in the electoral farce, seek to turn off the desire of the people of democratic rights and freedoms and spread racism and chauvinism against peoples (both the Spanish people and the oppressed nations of Latin America, Africa and Asia ).

     Boicot to the electoral farce!
    </strong>
   </h2>
   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-43db2a831728e0b29d7c1ecdec54e8b3">
    In recent years, revisionists and opportunists of all kinds have called for the masses to participate in the electoral farce, to turn their political claims in Parliament and continue along the bourgeois path. The bourgeois road only serves the bourgeoisie. You cannot change the bourgeois state from the inside, you cannot change a machine of oppression from within. Much less, independence can be achieved by participating within the institutions of the Spanish State (Generalitat, Diputations, Town Halls ...) and being part of it.

    An article published in Serve the People explained, in a summarized way, why the boycott should be applied. We reproduce it in full:

     "1. Why boycott the elections?
    </em>
   </p>
   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-01ac84d2637dd4556c0d6387dd05ef19">
    <em>
     - Because we chose the path of revolution and socialism, of the power of the proletarian class against the bourgeoisie. Participation in the elections, directly or indirectly, has nothing to do with the path to socialism (the proletarian revolution).
    </em>
   </p>
   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-058d18a76f3723b7f03b12b19e293f66">
    <em>
     - Because the elections within a bourgeois state are a farce. That is why we call him electoral or electoral farce of the bourgeoisie. They are not a farce because they are rigged, but because it does not matter what you vote: there is no real democracy. All really important decisions, absolutely all, are taken through other roads that are not parliamentarians.
    </em>
   </p>
   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ec8fbbeba3bedea7603ca8b1431de825">
    <em>
     - Because with the elections we chose the government, but not the State or the class that directs it. The government on duty is only the manager of the interests of the financial oligarchy, the imperialist bourgeoisie, which is the leader of the Spanish State. There is no difference, in the background, in all the governments of bourgeois democracy in recent history (approximately 1975).

     2. Why is it worth voting to stop fascism?

    <em>
     - Because the growing fascistization of the State (greater presence in the streets and in the media of fascist parties and/or organizations, increasing influence of reactionary ideas, etc ...) is the logical consequence of the militarization of the Spanish State. Since 1980, as an approximate date, states begin to militarize. Within the militarization plan of the Spanish State, fascistization is a consequence of this. Therefore, a greater presence of fascism is not caused by electoral success. It is conversely: the electoral success of reactionary and fascist forces is caused because fascism and reaction is more present in society, a consequence of this militarization and fascistization of states (and in this case, of the Spanish State)

    <em>
     - There will be no more or less repression of the labor movement based on the government on duty, or at least, by express decision of the party that governs. That is, the greater or lesser repression responds to the plans of the financial oligarchy, and not to the plans of the bourgeois leader on duty. During the last years of PSOE and Unidas Podemos we have suffered repression in the Metal strike of C√°diz and Vigo; the imprisonment of the political prisoner Pablo Hasel; They have not repealed the Gag Law; They have committed the genocide against the African masses in Melilla; They have committed thousands and thousands of evictions; They have infiltrated national police in social and political movements, etc.

    <em>
     - Because the less bad option is no option. Voting the PP, PSOE, Vox or Sumar does not change anything, they are all managers of financial capital. None of Parliament's parties question bourgeois order or Spanish imperialism. During the last years of PSOE and Unidos Podemos Podemos have worsened the living conditions of the proletariat in every way. Are we going to reward the managers of financial capital by voting again with the excuse of "stopping fascism", so that our lives get worse again?

   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c3c86c62bec26f8a16afc2055623309d">
    <em>
     - Because voting the less bad option does not protect civil, social or union rights. What rights have we recovered with the progressive coalition government between PSOE and Unidas Podemos? They have disarticulated the union movement and have repressed the combative mass movements. The CPI has risen much more than salaries. The alleged rights gain for proletarian women and the LGTB collective is a ghost embedded in a role, while hate crimes do not stop up. What has the government done for the proletariat? ‚Äù

     The Catalan proletariat must fight elbow with the Spanish proletariat, Basque and Gallego

    The Catalan proletariat will be completely free not only when their national rights are respected, but when it is released as a social class. And that goes through the destruction of the Spanish imperialist state, the old bourgeois state, and for generating a new power, the new proletarian state. The Catalan proletariat cannot fight only against the Spanish imperialist state. He must fight side by side with the Spanish, Basque and Galician proletariat as class brothers against the common enemy: the Spanish State, Spanish imperialism.
   </p>
   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6650c9c816ce3835d47fa9e5f2d3dd54">
    This titanic task goes through the reconstitution of the Communist Party of Spain as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist Party, mainly Maoist with the universal validity contributions of President Gonzalo. A militarized party prepared to take political power with popular war and with the perspective of capturing the dictatorship of the proletariat as Federal Socialist Republic where the proletariat of all nations fights, as class brothers and ultimately, to communism.

   <p class="has-foreground-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8428d398f295e1ad00da2a87087f3f80">
    Thus, and only, the Catalan proletariat will be free. And the first step cannot be another to delegitimize the electoral farce, discard illusions in bourgeois democracy and prepare for the fighting that will come in the fight against the Spanish State
