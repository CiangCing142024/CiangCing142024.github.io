  <p>
   Today we told our truth to journalists and journalists who wanted to listen to us.
  </p>
  <p>
   An uncomfortable truth, because since yesterday the accusations have been many, 
 different, one -way: we would be the antidemocrats, we would be the 
 fascists and anti -Semites.
  </p>
  <p>
   We firmly believe that we have not removed anyone the right to 
 Word: Maurizio Molinari is the director of La Repubblica, which all 
 days finds ample space to omit, cut and mend the 
 information and spread fake news on the genocide in Palestine.
  </p>
  <p>
   The indisposition to listening and dialogue have been demonstrated by 
 Molinari and Lorito, rector of Federico II, who have decided not to 
 introduce oneself to the initiative, nor to show us to listen to the 
 Motivations of our dissent.
  </p>
  <p>
   We would have liked to know more about the lack of expression, aside 
 by Maurizio Molinari with respect to the resignation of Raffaele Oriani, 
 Journalist of La Repubblica, who decided to leave the newspaper,
   <span>
   </span>
  </p>
  <a name="more">
  </a>
  denouncing the complicity of the newspaper with the genocide in Palestine, 
 not only through the declaredly philosionist narration, but also 
 through political agreements.
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The message we sent is clear: we want free knowledge, out of the dynamics of Zionist and war propaganda.
  </p>
  <p>
   This morning I receive the press release of students and students 
 of Pisa, who have not known the 
 Violence of a quick department just to be squeezed in the square a 
 protest, made us think.
   <span>
   </span>
  </p>
  <p>
   Why in our case, of students and students blocked by 
 Digos inside his university did not start the same 
 Solidarity mechanism?
  </p>
  <p>
   Those who are removed from are us, receiving instead of dialogue 
  democratic - so evoked by the director, to whom there would be from 
 ask why in his newspaper systematically prohibits the grip of 
 Word in favor of the Palestinian people - slaps, kicks, pushes from 
 part of Digos, in our training places.
  </p>
  <p>
   We know the truth and now those who read us know in turn.
   <br/>
   We are 
  And we will always be alongside the Palestinian people and we will continue to 
 oppose us to anyone who tries to remove legitimacy from his existence e 
 resistence.

   <strong>
    Solidarity press release to the student network for Palestine - Naples
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   The Handala Ali Cultural Center, Arab Democratic Union 
 Palestinian, young Palestinians of Italy and student movement 
 Palestinians express their sharing and solidarity in 
 against the dispute implemented yesterday by the student network 
 For Palestine-Napoli by students, activists and solidarity with the cause 
 of the Palestinian people on the occasion of the conference "The role of 
 culture in the context of a disputed Mediterranean ", organized 
 from the Federico II University with the participation of the director of “La 
 Repubblica ”Maurizio Molinari, as well as with that of the rector of the 
 Same University, Matteo Lorito.
  </p>
  <p>
   The protest was intended to denounce the connivance of the world 
 of the press and Italian academic institutions with i 
 carpet bombing conducted for over more than six months now 
 by the Israeli army on Gaza: a military campaign that, with 
 thirty -two thousand deaths, seventy -five thousand wounded and the almost two million 
 displaced people driven out of their homes and their land, has taken on to 
 eyes of the world, of the International Court of Justice of the Hague e 
 of the large part of the public opinion in the same West on the 
 character of a genocide - extermination, with bombs, executions 
 summary, by hungry or for lack of medical care.
  </p>
  <p>
   We would have liked to speak of this and we believe it is necessary to speak 
 At this moment: of the daily inhumanization of the population 
 Palestinian, which allows you to ignore the violence that it is suffering, 
 to reduce them, push them 'at the bottom of the page', relativize them and 
 justify them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Such is in fact the narrative that the main organs of 
 'Information' in this country, starting right from Repubblica and the 
 Other "mainstream" newspapers - and in general in the West - are 
 transmitting, with omissions, deformations and forcing more and more 
 showy, in the desperate attempt to conceal the scope and the 
 immense proportions of the crimes conducted by the state of Israel, of 
 'Remove' the colonial nature of Israeli employment and with this 
  The past and present crimes of which western colonialism is 
 responsible.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is the same one -way narration - aimed at excluding the reasons 
 of the oppressed - which leads to criminalizing the Palestinian resistance, 
 deliberately forgetting that the same international rules sanction 
 the right of a people to resist the occupant by any means 
 necessary.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is accompanied by the complicity that manifest vast sectors of the 
 scientific research and the Italian academic world, which continue to 
 Tighten cooperation agreements with Israeli institutions 
 directly involved with employment and extermination policies - a 
 starting from the shameful presence of the rectors of the Campania universities 
 In the Med-Or Scientific Committee, the Foundation of the Leonardo Group, 
 Directly engaged in refueling weapons to the Israeli army.
  </p>
  <p>
   We would like to reiterate that, differently from what is argued by 
 Molinari and relaunched by the main press bodies, by exponents 
 government and opposition politicians to the same press release of 
 President of the Republic, were the same organizers 
 of the meeting to clearly exclude any discussion, already starting 
  from the formula chosen together with the University: that of a debate 
 fake, 'armored', closed to the free participation of the students, with 
  Access to the Hall manned since the morning by police officers 
 which once again tried to remove with thrusts and kicks 
 students and students who intended to express their dissent in 
 comparisons of the initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
   Then, in the face of the presence of who that dissent was decided anyway 
  To express it, the director of Repubblica canceled the meeting e 
 chosen the path of journalistic criminalization, manifesting the 
 same intolerance to the criticism and the dispute that in others 
 Recent occasions has led to the beating of students and activists.
  </p>
  <p>
   We tried to stage yet another act of a campaign of 
 media normalization of the ongoing genocide, what most presses to the 
  ruling class of this country.
  </p>
  <p>
   Faced with all this, together with students and activists, we have 
 claimed a university that is a place of real confrontation and production 
 of a knowledge free from complicity with the Zionist occupation, with the 
 war and oppression policies.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally, reading the press release in which the Head of State 
 manifests his solidarity towards the director of 
 "Repubblica", we wonder where solidarity is towards the 
 Atrocious suffering of the Palestinian population; because you continue to 
 ignore the responsibilities of the Italian institutions, of which he is a guarantor, 
  in the undergoing slaughter; how it is possible, finally, not to see that the 
 students and students who played in Naples yesterday are the 
 themselves that in Pisa, Florence, Turin have challenged the repression and the 
 "Intolerance" of those same institutions.
