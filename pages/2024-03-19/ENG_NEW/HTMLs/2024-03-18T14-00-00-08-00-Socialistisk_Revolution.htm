  After many years of Vladimir Putin in power and his party's anti -political policy, which has been characterized by arrests of anti -war demonstrants and the persecution of anti -imperialist and socialist groups, the ruling bourgeoisie is now facing a clear opposition from the Russian masses. However, it is important to emphasize that the election in Russia should be sabotaged and boycotted, even if Putin and his party were not in power. No matter which party appears on the ballot, they represent the same class interest. Even a figure like Navalnyj, which the Western bourgeois media exalted to be a advocate of freedom, was in fact an Islamophobic right-wing extremist who served the interests of Yankee imperialism. Instead, it is the masses who must take power, through the reconstitution of Lenin's and Stalin's party and the introduction of the People's War.
