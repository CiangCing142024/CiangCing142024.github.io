 The 
 Tunisian Police State regime of Sieda continues to persecute 
 by means of a judicial frame the political militant e 
 social and for the Palestinian cause, the journalist Ghassen Ben 
 Khalifa.
 <p>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Already 
 In the summer of 2022, Ghassen had been accused of managing a 
 Facebook page linked to Islamist radicalism and therefore accused of 
 terrorism, this accusation immediately appeared as a clear frame 
 since Ghassen is notoriously a militant of the left 
 revolutionary.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  For 
 engraved, it was the first case of judicial persecution 
 towards a revolutionary militant since the time of the regime of Ben Ali, 
 Not even the governments of the post-revolution restoration, better known with 
 The misleading formula of "democratic transition" 
 (2011-2021), had pursued left militants.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  After 
 five days of stop status and a great manifestation of 
 solidarity in Tunis in the height of summer,
  <span>
  </span>
  Ghassen had finally been 
 released but the judicial proceeding was not yet 
 Filed.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  They followed 
 of the hearings in court in which the royal manager of the page 
 incriminated he declared the manager every time he was himself 
 of the pages and the author of the publications and not to know 
 Ghassen.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  Meanwhile 
 The accusation of "offense of others by means of social media was also added 
 media "and" participation in a terrorist conspiracy " 
 and "offensive conduct towards the president".
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The 
 Last March 14 the judge of the first instance of the Court of Ben 
 ARUS (area of Grande Tunis) has sentenced Ghassen to 6 months of 
 imprisonment, not with immediate effect pending a further 
 Audience that provides for the examination of the most serious accusations for the next 5 
 April.
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  The 
 our party expresses sincere solidarity with his partner Ghassen Ben 
 Khalifa, denounced Sieda's reactionary regime of police state 
 supported by imperialism, including Italian imperialism today 
 represented by the neo-fascist government Meloni.

   I want 
 say, the judge, was not convinced by the words of the 
 Lawyers who presented him copies of the Lord's confessions 
 arrested (while I was detained and we were consulting the unit 
 national to investigate the terrorist crimes of the Aouina) and in 
 he confirmed that he was only his page and that he was the one who published 
 Everything about it and who did not know me at all ... in addition to what 
 demonstrated (from the archive of my Facebook account) that on the date e 
 allegedly presumed (according to a technical report by the Department of 
 Technical services of the General Security Administration 
 National) I would have contacted the page from an IP address connected to 
 my phone number. At that moment I was connected by my account 
 and I integrated and placed on my personal page from an IP address 
 completely different...

 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <i>
   In 
 other words, Mr. Judge considered the report of 
 security of dubious authenticity (and does not explain at all how it is 
 arrived at this conclusion. The second accused is stronger than 
 Results of the research of the al-Awaina division and stronger 
 of the apparent contradiction of my well -known intellectual position e 
 political beliefs [divergent] from the inconvenstance of that page ...

 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">

   There 
 conclusion is that we will appeal against this unjust sentence e 
 We will prepare for the April session. I assure all companions 
 And friends that the morale is high. Also reassure all those who 
 they believe that with accusations and inventions such ridiculous can make me of the 
 bad, intimidating me or making me an example ...

   Yesterday, 
 14/03/2024, the first degree court of Ben Arous sentenced to 
 Six months of imprisonment his partner Ghassan Ben Khalifa, one of the 
 founding members of the campaign and chief editor of the Inhez website, 
 A combatant of the joint action coordination for Palestine 
 and member of the Solidarity Committee with the activist George Ibrahim

 After being suspended for five days in September 2022.

 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <i>
   There 
 sentence refers to the accusation of “insult to others through 
 Social media "moved against Ghassan under the" moral "aspect 
 of the case. It is an accusation against him on the basis of 
 accusations contained in a report by one of the Departments of the Ministry 
 of the interior, according to which the page "Vulcano Tunisino" was 
 connected to an IP address connected to its phone number. That is 
 it was demonstrated false by the defense, on the basis of the archive of 
 his contacts on his personal page (from which he appears that al 
 moment of the alleged technical assessment he was connected to his 
 personal page with a different IP address), and confessions of the 
 Moderator of the page that was suspended before the release of 
 Ghassan Bin Khalifa in September 2022, and who denied knowing 
 the partner or to have any relationship with the aforementioned page, that 
 He confirmed that he manages alone.

   We,

   Yesterday
On Thursday, 14 March 2024, the Ben Arous Court of First Instance
sentenced to six months' imprisonment in a sub-case against the
comrade Ghassan Ben Khalifa, journalist, editor-in-chief of the site
Inhivez, activist of the Coordination of Joint Action movement
for Palestine, a member of the Tunisian boycott and
opposition to the normalization of the Zionist entity and member of the
Committee of the Tunisian Committee of Solidarity with the Fighter for
George Ibrahim Abdullah.

 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <i>
   AND 
 important that the coordination of the common action for Palestine 
 clarify the public opinion that this sentence is based on a 
 safety report that included the name of the activist of 
 left Ghassan Bin Khalifa in one case relating to the management of a 
 Page on the social network Facebook with "Islamist" content. 
 The main defendant is arrested and admits that he is the 
 owner and the manager of the page, to be responsible for 
 all his posts and not to have any relationship or knowledge with the 
 company.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <i>
   The 
 Coordination of common action for Palestine, while considering that 
 this unjust sentence and everything that plots against his 
 activist, is in the context of his struggle activity 
 linked to the support of resistance and against normalization, 
 confirms that targeting its activists with invented accusations 
 He will not discourage them from carrying out his struggle actions. The 
 security apparatuses lurking against activists will do nothing else 
 that increase their firmness.
  </i>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <i>
   The 
 coordination also invites all political organizations 
 national, progressive and revolutionary, groups and institutions 
 of civil society to support the Palestinian cause and all 
 Tunisini to attend in large numbers on April 5, 2024 in front of the 
 Tunisian first instance court to support the activist of 
 left Ghassan Ben Khalifa in the first hearing of the original case 
 in which it is accused of "participation in a criminal agreement" e 
 of “having committed a despicable act against the president of the 
 Repubblica ”and other accusations invented.
