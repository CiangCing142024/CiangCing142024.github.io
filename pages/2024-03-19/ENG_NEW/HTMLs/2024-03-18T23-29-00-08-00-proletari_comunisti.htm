theoretical and practical aspects, has enabled the staff of the companies in the

the procedures to be adopted in the event of disturbances, situations of 
danger and threat to public order, with the aim of strengthening the

 the techniques acquired and the ability to react in "Crowd" contexts 
and Riot Control"".
