 Milan recalled with an event, Saturday afternoon,
 <a href="https://www.milanotoday.it/tag/dax/">
  Davide Cesare
 </a>
 , 
  said DAX, activist of the Orso Social Center who was killed in 2003 
 outside a pub in Milan by Federico, Mattia and Giorgio Morbi, brothers and 
  Dad from far -right sympathies. For what was renamed 
 The black night of Milan - At San Paolo, where Dax died, there were clashes 
  Between antagonists and law enforcement agencies - a day was organized 
 dedicated to the young man, who is remembered every year by the movements gathered 
  Under the abbreviation "Dax resists".
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  In hundreds, between activists of social centers and antagonistic acronyms, 
 they participated in the procession. The serpentone, like every year, has passed by 
  Via Brioschi corner of Zamenhof (Porta Ticinese), where the young man was

 killed, to San Vittore. Many slogans against forces 
 order and the far right- "Fascists and police, from ours 
 neighborhoods we will chase away " - and many flags for Palestine. They are 
  be vandalized and smeared the windows of a supermarket and one 
 bank.

  "Also this year we keep our fight against a capitalism alive that 
  It is collapse, which sees the proliferation of imperialist wars and 
 tightening of securitarian supported by the neo -fascist parties on the rise in everything 
  the European territory. In Italy, to determine the current situation 
 were the private policies of the Democratic Party and the previous governments, 
 who have expanded the social gap and placed the economic bases for the 
  Success of far -right populisms. In this context, the 
 Islamophoba propaganda with which the media distort the genocide of 
 Palestinian people and call his resistance 'terrorist' 
 to the Western Israelo employment is a subtle attempt to 
 discourage the construction of an antagonistic consciousness 
 internationalist ",
