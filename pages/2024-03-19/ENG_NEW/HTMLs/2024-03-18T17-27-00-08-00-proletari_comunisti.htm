   believes it is

  <em>
   <span>
    "superfluous 
 emphasize that these numbers are not verifiable by neutral sources 
 and almost no western nation has provided information about the 
 own 'volunteers' who went to fight in Ukraine

  </em>
  <span>
   ". 
 According to the site, they sporadically reported sources in Poland and 
 Czech Republic, as well as no official data has ever emerged in 
 West about the fallen in the ranks of the mercenaries.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The theme has never been treated 
 officially not even in Italy, if not at the journalistic level with 
 rare interviews with some volunteers.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   Among the African countries, the greatest number of 
 Mercenaries comes from Nigeria: 97 (47 of which killed), followed 
 from the Algeria (28 deaths si 60 enrolled), while 25 Australians are 
 been killed on 60 joints in Ukraine, together with 6 of 7 
 New Zealanders.

 Russia had declared that a day before its forces had 
 carried out a precision attack against a building that 
 it housed "foreign fighters" in the second city 
 of Ukraine, Kharkiv.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  <span>
   The Russian Ministry of Defense had 
 declared that the fighters were mostly French mercenaries and 
 that the building had been destroyed, with over 60 deaths. That 
 Evidently they don't even care about countries of origin ...
