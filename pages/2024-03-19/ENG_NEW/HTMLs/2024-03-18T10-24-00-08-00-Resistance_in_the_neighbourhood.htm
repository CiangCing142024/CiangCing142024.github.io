  Down with trade union and political persecution – Hands off unions, struggles and strikes
 </p>
 <p>
  After three successful meetings of Trade Unions &amp; Movements, Collectives and Neighborhood Movements against persecution but also against the general climate of terrorism and attack of trade union and political action, we are in the final straight for the demonstration on Thursday, March 21, at 6.30 pm at the Municipal Theatre Square of Piraeus.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our initiative is of particular importance, both after the escalation of police violence at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with the arrests of dozens of students and after the fast track dismissal procedures for trade union reasons of contract worker and trade unionist. From the NCSR. But also the new case of discipline preparation in the Piraeus GRN.
 </p>
 <p>
  The demonstration has been propagated with visits to schools and tours in neighborhoods, posters, press releases and a press conference held on Friday 15/3 at the Piraeus Bar Association. Placements were made by:
 </p>
