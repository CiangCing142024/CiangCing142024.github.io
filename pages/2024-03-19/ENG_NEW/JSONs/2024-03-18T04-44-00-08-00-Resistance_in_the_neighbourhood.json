Their gigantic? The targeting of the country even with nuclear reprisals by hostile (for the people?) countries (controlled by bourgeois leaderships?) because of his degradation into a military arena of the most bloodthirsty vampires on the planet? An institutional cause, which is already exacerbated by the adventurism of the dreamy Psorokostina (because this remains) with the scar of Asia Minor and Cyprus on her body.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n That is, those of active participation with a rifle in the front line of the Titanic Front of imperialist competitions. As well as the care of a genocide - ethnic cleansing where the inhumane lake is struggling, to exterminate more Palestinians than the Zionist fire. Or is a new landing on Chania murderous aircraft crews whose violence overcomes their porn over?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Fortunately- according to anxious journalists- the previous nightmares do not apply. On the contrary, the integration (submission) of Greece's dependent order into the \"right\" gang of international slaughterhouses and their fanatical framework (frigates, infantry decision to send business plans) defends security (one candidate Hiroshima) (The same as \"magical\" enjoy Syrianians?). So where does the fear come about?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Are earthquakes and other natural disasters foreshadowed by state infrastructure, cares unsuitable to deal with them? Is it estimated that Erdogan will attack us despite the truce dictated by Uncle (master) Sam? Will poverty and high prices escalate, sinking the majority of the population to the bottom of misery, while at the same time profiteering and enriching the capitalists?  Will the suicides of those who lack financial resources to buy medicines and resort to the afternoon surgeries of devastated (the always expensive gunpowder like carnivore feeds on the prey of social welfare) be massive?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Is there a prediction of increasing the workplace \"accidents\" due to the frenzied intensification of malicious staff in tourist galleys? Over -echoing the tertiary sector (the heavy industry of ... serving!) Is the most distorted growth promoted? Do the Cretan -based Cretan in the Hard Present Thinking To Power the Wave of Pentecost? Are the peasantry and with the trick of forest capital protection, are local property? Wind turbines, photovoltaic parks, hydrocarbon drilling, electricity pillars, energy roads and other monstrous interventions in the environment are it calculated that they will harm it incompetent? Are they redeemed with homemade crumbs and is the island under foreign predatory giants?\n <br/>\n <br/>\n None \u2013 fortunately again \u2013 of the above is true, as the demons (here heavily paid) of printing and electronic disinformation media assure in chord with local actors and central decision-makers. So is panic unjustified? Of course not. Already in the last quarter 1500 \"raiders\" (rags) disembarked on the south coast, causing the inseparability.  In contrast to the spacious hospitality of almost six million visitors in summer. Oh, flows from North Africa are rapidly growing.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Ironic; Those who have not been drowned with walnuts are forced or dipped by the thousand Christian crosses on the day (Pylos) in the heartfelt for the culprits and racist for the victims of the area- of the region. From where they took off those bombers, they leveled their ancestrals.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Outraged? Because our country's increasingly bold involvement in Western war adventures will give birth to new desperate caravans. Since the Memorandum Politics of the Surprise of the Liturgy Homeland Mother with the calamity of Smyrna and persecution in the distant slaves of youth are common with those of current looting -trashing and exterminating expatriates.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n A people unable to defend the refugees and immigrants, it is certainly unable to fight for their own right in bread, health, studies and peace. The progressive forces of the non -reformist left fight for the exact opposite.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n Besides, no one knows what lies ahead. Already in the past (and indeed in the recent memorandums) we found ourselves in their plight. By expressing class and internationalist solidarity with tormented third parties, we are building conditions for our own bearable today and redemptive tomorrow.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n But there are genuine, devastating, hateful garbage that threaten us deadly. It is not the distant runners from the hell of fire or hunger, who in their impasses seek refuge in a destination of beasts. It is those criminals who live in the bases with their domestic applause, their locks.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n The waste for the consolidation of society must actually be buried in the landfills of history.\n <br/>\n <br/>\n KM (Member of the Resistance Initiative)\n <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n </div>\n</div>\n", "description": "", "author": ["\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u039d."], "labels": ["\u039a.\u039c.", "\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2", "\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2"], "source": "https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_40.html", "source_name": "Resistance in the neighbourhood"}
