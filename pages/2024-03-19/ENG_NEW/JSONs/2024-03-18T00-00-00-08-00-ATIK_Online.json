The AKP-MHP fascist power, which spends the sweat of peoples, laborers and poor on the arms, pillages and transforms the geography of Turkey and Kurdistan into a war area and a prison with oppression, isolation and persecution, gives people hell to the peoples.\n  <br/>\n  Against this, our common struggle in every field, our strength and resistance that we will provide together, has a great meaning these days when Newroz is approaching. AKP-MHP fascist block but\n  <br/>\n  It can be regressed by creating a common spirit of resistance and enlarging the common network. The pressure on the peoples, political genocide operations, trustees, pressures on the laborers, deepening economic crisis can be regressed by the emergence of the will of the people at a further level. It is one of the struggle lines in which the will of the people in Newroz emerged. Newroz is one of the most peaks of the struggle for peace against the war and the most peak of the peoples. Us with different accusations\n  <br/>\n  Newroz has been the day we will scream against those who try to separate. As revolutionary and socialist institutions living in Europe, we urge this year to mobilize the Newroz to further enlarge the resistance to jointization in all Newrozs that will take place in Frankfurt this year.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://www.atik-online.net/blog/adgbden-newroz-cagrisi", "type": "article", "title": "Newroz call from ADGB", "description": "We are in Frankfurt to enlarge the united struggle against fascism and celebrate Newroz on the Resistance Day ...", "author": ["muhabirhasan"], "categories": ["Avrupa", "Haberler", "Manset"], "link-section": "haberler", "source_name": "ATIK Online"}
