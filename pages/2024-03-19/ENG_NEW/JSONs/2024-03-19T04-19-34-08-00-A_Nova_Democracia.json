In the text of the court decision that led to the arrest of the activist, the judge even stated, to justify the urgent character of the arrest that: \u201c(\u2026) Paul not only prepares for the invasion of the farm posts, but also in the possibility of that there is a possible slaughter against its employees.

There, the farmer has a very large influence trafficking with the Boca do Acre police [municipality of Amazonas], with the Acre police, \u201dsaid the activist.\n </p>\n <figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n  <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n   <img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-171184\" data-id=\"171184\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\" data-lazy-src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zamora-e-Zamora-Filho-tentando-intimidar-os-posseiros-da-regiao.png\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zamora-e-Zamora-Filho-tentando-intimidar-os-posseiros-da-regiao.png 437w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zamora-e-Zamora-Filho-tentando-intimidar-os-posseiros-da-regiao-300x225.png 300w, https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zamora-e-Zamora-Filho-tentando-intimidar-os-posseiros-da-regiao-60x45.png 60w\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zamora-e-Zamora-Filho-tentando-intimidar-os-posseiros-da-regiao.png\" srcset=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Zamora-e-Zamora-Filho-tentando-intimidar-os-posseiros-da-regiao.png\" width=\"437\"/>\n   <figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">\n    Zamora and Zamora Filho trying to intimidate the squatters of the region.

And he has the greatest hatred for the name of our community to be Marielle Franco. There he is the owner of the situation. To register a complaint against him, no one can. \u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Paulo S\u00e9rgio still complements, reiterating his commitment to the righteous struggle for land: \u201cHere is a city without law. Send who has money, obeys who does not have. Only I don't have [money] and I don't even want to obey. I will not obey the law of terror, \u201dhe says.\n </p>\n <p>\n  According to CPT lawyer, Afonso Chagas, who accompanied the custody hearing where the indefinite prison was maintained: \u201cWe will be prepared for everything, including a negative in court, we immediately resort to the Superior Court of Justice (STJ). Paulo is arrested for leading a criminal organization, that is, the people who fight for the right to land is criminalized, and the land is public, \u201dconcludes Afonso.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incra's superintendent in Amazonas, Denis da Silva Pereira, reiterates that the area, in fact, belongs to the Union. According to him, after a cartographic study, Incra identified that the area, which has about 48 thousand hectares, is Inside the New Christmas Gleba and is R\u00e9voluta Land.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The landowner in question, Zamora, who claims to be the owner of the land, would never have proven with any title the authorities in question, even being asked several times on the issue. The man, of S\u00e3o Paulo origin, would have declared in 2010, to have at least 3 farms in the Acre region and at least 30,000 heads of cattle, and even composed a landowner who traveled to China to increase the export of his \u201cGreen/ecosustainable meat\u201d for the country.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/am-lideranca-camponesa-e-presa-apos-denunciar-crimes-do-latifundio/", "type": "article", "title": "AM: Peasant Leadership is arrested after denouncing Latifundium crimes - the new democracy", "description": "Paulo was arrested after denouncing kidnappings and torture of peasants at the behest of local landowners.
