However, it is important to emphasize that the election in Russia should be sabotaged and boycotted, even if Putin and his party were not in power. No matter which party appears on the ballot, they represent the same class interest. Even a figure like Navalnyj, which the Western bourgeois media exalted to be a advocate of freedom, was in fact an Islamophobic right-wing extremist who served the interests of Yankee imperialism. Instead, it is the masses who must take power, through the reconstitution of Lenin's and Stalin's party and the introduction of the People's War.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://socialistiskrevolution.wordpress.com/2024/03/18/rusland-masserne-gor-opror-mod-valgfarcen/", "type": "article", "title": "Russia: The masses make rebellion against the electoral", "description": "While the Russian imperialists are preparing for an election campaign, the masses in several regions have condemned the election and made their opposition.
