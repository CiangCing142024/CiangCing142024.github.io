Rise in prices and increase of the CPI, labor exploitation, rise in rents, evictions and police violence, etc. Catalan bourgeois politicians in Barcelona have governed in the same way as Spanish bourgeois politicians in Madrid.

Therefore, a greater presence of fascism is not caused by an election success.
