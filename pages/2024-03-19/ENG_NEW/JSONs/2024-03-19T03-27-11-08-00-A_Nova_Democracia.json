And there was no blow not only because some people who were in charge of the Armed Forces did not want to do, they did not accept the president's idea, but also because the president is a cowardly. He did not have the courage to execute what he planned, he was in the house crying almost a month and preferred to escape to the US than to do what he had promised, in the expectation that abroad the blow could happen because they funded people in Gate of the quarters to try to stimulate the blow. \u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  Although it is exactly his description of Bolsonaro, Luiz In\u00e1cio Claudio consciously in the fight against coup. Although it does not save on the rank of the high military mandates who opened openly for the institutional rupture, the truth is that Luiz Inacio Apazigue views thick and conciliates with those for whom the armed forces should be spun of \u201cdemocracy\u201d - and therefore spun from its restriction or suspension.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let's look at the current commander, Tom\u00e1s Ribeiro Paiva, treated by Luiz Inacio as noble democratic figure. On January 18, 2023, ten days after the fateful January 8 - when hundreds of \u201cgreen chickens\u201d promoted invasion in the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Powers - the general was caught \u201canalysis of the political situation\u201d in a meeting with his subordinates. At the time, Thomas was a military commander of the Southeast.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In his exhibition, the general begins by evaluating the outcome of the elections: \"Unfortunately it was the result that, for most of us, was unwanted but happened.\" Thomas argues that, despite this, we need to follow life.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Later, referring to January 8, he said: \u201cHere the deplorable and unfortunate scenes. We gave the guy a tool to call a terrorist. \u201d The \"guy\" was Alexandre de Moraes, elected Archirrival for Bolsonaro himself. \u201cThis is vandal, this is crazy, it is expensive that has come into a fanatic spiral that does not support itself. What did you produce? Anything. The guy shit in the Supreme Chair. What does that change? Changes no fucking. \u201d Outraged, the general continues: \u201cWhat a childish thing, dumb, they [the 'green chickens']\n  <strong>\n   have delivered a huge saved to a narrative that we are seeing that it is being established now\n  </strong>\n  \u201d. Later, he concludes: \u201cOn the 8th, we had an unacceptable event under any circumstances. Vandalism. Projected the negative image of Brazil in the world and, from a strategic point of view,\n  <strong>\n   Strengthens the opponent\n  </strong>\n  . Then it gave problem. \u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  As it turns out, General Tom\u00e1s Paiva, who won the notorious title of General Democrat by arguing that politics and barracks should not mix, does just that in his lecture. Why did you reveal your frustration with the fact that the \"green chickens\" have discredited the cause of military intervention, now called \"terrorism\" by this \"huge narrative that is being established now\"? Doesn't that look like an explicit political position of an active high officer - being a crime according to the military regulation? And after all, who is the opponent favored strategically? It would be the left - or what the general identifies as \u201cleft\u201d? Now, but wouldn't the army be a \"state institution\", \"apartisan\"?\n </p>\n <p>\n  The current army commander goes further and complains about those who intended to occur military intervention at that time. \u201cImpossible to do. We saw the consequences of this. You saw the worldwide repercussion. Imagine if we had taken it for an adventure? We would not survive as a country; The\n  <strong>\n   currency would explode\n  </strong>\n  . We were going to take a\n  <strong>\n   Economic blockade never seen\n  </strong>\n  . You were going to be an outcast, and our people were going to suffer the consequences. Would have\n  <strong>\n   blood on the street\n  </strong>\n  .\n  <strong>\n   Or you think the people were going to stay at home\n  </strong>\n  . It wasn't going to happen. We would dive the country into chaos. \u201d As can be noted, what moves its objection is not the defense of the noble cause of \u201cdemocracy\u201d, so loved by Tom\u00e1s Ribeiro Paiva, but the lack of international support (\n  <a href=\"https://anovademocracia.com.br/ex-chanceler-do-mexico-afirma-que-usa-persuadiram-militares-brasileiros-a-nao-unirem-se-a-bolsonaro-em-8-de-janeiro/\">\n   The US State Department had pronounced itself in April that it would not accept scam and would impose economic sanctions\n  </a>\n  ) and justification in the face of internal public opinion, or more exactly, fear of raising revolutionary resistance to total military intervention.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It remains to ask: What if these variables did not exist? Would Tom\u00e1s Ribeiro Paiva and his \"legalist\" peers consider the hypothesis of dismissing a military coup now if the masses were undergravation and if he had the consent of the US State Department? Or would Tom\u00e1s Ribeiro Paiva staged the role of Castelo Branco, the liberal ultrarectionary general who, in a week, swore loyalty to the government of Jango and, in the other, headed the first military government following the 1964 coup, which would later be swallowed by far right?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Luiz In\u00e1cio, committed to electorally polarizing Bolsonaro, is forgetting to take care of his own rear. More dangerous than Bolsonaro, they are the generals of the high command.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/luiz-inacio-deveria-se-preocupar-com-os-generais-legalistas/", "type": "article", "title": "Luiz In\u00e1cio should worry about the 'legalistic generals' - the new democracy", "description": "Would Tom\u00e1s Ribeiro Paiva and his \"legalist\" peers consider the hypothesis of dismissing a military coup now if the masses were undergravation and if he had the consent of the US State Department?", "modified time": "2024-03-18T18:19:45-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-18T18:19:45-03:00", "author": ["Ja\u00edlson de Souza"], "categories": ["Situa\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica"], "tags": ["60 anos de 1964"], "sections": ["Situa\u00e7\u00e3o Pol\u00edtica"], "link-section": "situacao-politica", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
