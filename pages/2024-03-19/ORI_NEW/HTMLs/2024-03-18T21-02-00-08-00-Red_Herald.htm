  Throughout the auditorium, flags of organizations and banners with slogans of the struggle for land decorated the environment. Right on the access road, a banner “
  <strong>
   Out
  </strong>
  <strong>
   with the
  </strong>
  <strong>
   land grabbers! For the titling of our possessions!”
  </strong>
  set the tone for the event. Inside the auditorium, other banners condemned land grabbing, large-scale mining and called for peasant unity. The signatures were from squatters from different communities, such as Gleba Campina, Povoado Vilela, the Caranandeua and Jaraquara Communities and the Farmers Association of the Povoado de Maracacuera, in the municipality of Carutapera.

  In a joint note, the Solidarity Comitê de Solidariedade à Luta pela Terra (COMSOLUTE) and the União das Comunidades em Luta (UCL) writes:
  <em>
   “This is a victorious event in every sense: in establishing and unifying a political agenda to defend human rights of the people; in producing legal material to support the communities’ cause; in stirring those present around solidarity with the struggle for land”.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The note also gives a warm greeting to the Coletivo Estudantil Filhos do Povo, which prepared a bus full of students. According to those present, the Popular Court was a milestone in the development of the new student movement in Maranhão.
