  The crisis of the military regime in Myanmar, who is accelerating the recruitment of civilians to try to prevent their inevitable fall, is sharpening. The regime’s armed forces nowadays suffer a very low moral and great defections of troops. In this occasion

  on the population that can be recruited, which has led to an increase in migration to bordering countries to prevent being recruited. In turn, many families negotiate with the military so that their relatives are not sent to the front. Especially there is a huge number of Burmes who are fleeing to

   the recruitment has begun

  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This acceleration of recruitment occurs in a very complicated context for the Myanmar’s military regime, in which they see how they suffer a defeat after another at several points of their territory. The situation especially continues to worsen in the state of Rakhine and its surroundings, also in the south of the state of Chin.

   In Rakhine, in the last four months of offensive
  </a>
  of the Arakan Army, nine towns and 16 military bases of the military regime have been taken, in addition to hundreds of military and police outposts. In total it is estimated that 1,200 regime soldiers have fled to India and Bangladesh, nine military ships have been destroyed, seven high rank officers have been eliminated and another six have been captured, and a helicopter has been taken down. The military regime applies the scorched land tactic and

  To the serious crisis suffered by the military regime in Rakhine, it is added an escalation of the conflict in the state of Kachin, bordering with China. There the

  in dozens of villages throughout the Burmese territory, as in the states of Shan, Chin, Kachin, Mon, and in the regions of Tanintharyi, Magwe, Bago and Ayeyarwady. But everything it is trying has been in vain, since the resistance against the military regime has only grown since the beginning of its offensives, and each attack carried out by the old State is another spark that makes the fire grow in the prairie.
