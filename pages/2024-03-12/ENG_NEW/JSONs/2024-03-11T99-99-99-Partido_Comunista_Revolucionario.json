They want to prohibit the law of voluntary interruption of pregnancy and eli. And they caused when on Friday morning they announced that the Women's Hall of the Casa Rosada would be renamed as Hall of the Pr\u00f3ceres, replacing the Juana Azurduy box with that of the deliveryman and vendatria Carlos Menem.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This massive national day expressed that we are not going to take a step back in defending the rights conquered with years of struggle and we give the fight for which we still have.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   <strong>\n    CABA\n   </strong>\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n   The massive and unitary concentration against the National Congress with the different feminist groups and diversity, was the result of a great effort to unify the entire movement with massive assemblies.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   A colorful crowd with green scarves, violets and roses, banners with the slogans: \"Down the DNU\", \"necessary and urgent is the fight against hunger\", murgas, photos of the victims of femicide with claims of justice, by the Emergency in violence, with songs against the misogynist Milei.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Occupied and unemployed workers, students, artistic groups, neighborhood assemblies, political parties moved massively.

The column left from the high of the city ending in the civic center with a popular pot. In a unified document we denounce how this policy affects us and that is why we are about to face it.

Then, an immense column of more than five compact blocks with Nicol Posada's family in the head, the last victim of femicide in the province on February 17. The emergency campaign in violence against women and the pink scarf was the protagonist of the mobilization. A unified document was read by denouncing the adjustment of the national government and the burning of dolls was made with the face of Milei, Villarruel and Bullrich.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In\n   <strong>\n    Viedma\n   </strong>\n   , we mobilize unionized women in ATE, UNTER, SITRAJUR, CTAA, and social organizations and movements. The concentration started from one of the neighborhoods most affected by Milei's policies, the legislature, justice was passed and culminated in the Interior, where a document was read that denounced the situation of adjustment, delivery and repression of the government national.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We march massively in\n   <strong>\n    Cipolletti\n   </strong>\n   y\n   <strong>\n    Five jumps\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In\n   <strong>\n    Catriel,\n   </strong>\n   We focus on the family's square, a place that historically houses the struggle of women in our city. The particularity was the meeting of many women from different neighborhoods and of different ages who sang against Milei's adjustment and hunger policy and demanded to maintain the conquered rights. The grandmother and aunt of Agustina Atencio, one of the three victims of femicide of Catriel was present in the march. The undersecretary of women, equality and diversity of the municipality, Lucia Galv\u00e1n, expressed concern about the situation that women are going through and promised to continue working in territory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In R\u00edo Negro, we live a massive 8 m, unity and in the streets denouncing each and every one of the abuses. The only need and urgency is to stop hunger and femicides.

We did it under the slogans below the DNU, enough of adjustment and in defense of our rights.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The successful and massive day was the result of a great effort to unify the entire women's movement of the province.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The multisectoral of women, in coordination with other forces converged in an extraordinary act where we could express our total repudiation of the reactionary government of Milei, a hunger and hunger partner by particularly attacking women and diversities, attacking our rights and holding misogynistic and patriarchal speeches .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   All sectors were present, occupied workers, unemployed, native, peasants, secondary and university students in a column of wide unit coordinated by the strain, the companions of the house of women Nassif, the women of the CCC, FNC, the companions of guilds and unions, the environmentalists, of the culture, the teachers, retired, relatives of victims of femicides and other sectors.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This massive day of struggle firmly demonstrated that we are not going to take a step back in defending the conquered and fighting for what we are still owed, that we are not afraid of the antipiquetes of Milei and Bullrich protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The repudiation was enormous with the positioning of our provincial deputies, who endorsed by Governor Jaldo, voted against the interests of the country.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Between rivers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The day of March 8 in the province was massive and summoned many women, more than at other times. In Paran\u00e1, the unity between the two historical currents that have approached the Movement of Women and Feminist - the multisectoral of entrerrianan women and the assembly of women, lesbians, transvestites, trans and not binaries -, arises as the key to face reactionary policies and macho of Milei. The Assembly document for 8M, joint elaboration, raises \u201cneither one more attack, nor one less right. We are not the caste. With hunger, precarization and repression there is no freedom.
