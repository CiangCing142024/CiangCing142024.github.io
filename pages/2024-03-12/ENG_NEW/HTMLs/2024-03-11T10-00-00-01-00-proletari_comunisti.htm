 Extreme right parties in the countries of the European Union and in Parliament 
 European are supported and support reactionary, racist policies and

 old forces are strengthened, which represent the extremes of capitalism, 
 of exploitation and social, ethnic, religious discrimination, 
 cultural and gender. All this ideological and political offensive you are 
 carried out parallel to the attack on rights and conquests for decades it was 
 necessary for EU imperialist bourgeoisie. It was necessary to put under the 
 reflectors the workers and oppressed and give them the blame for the crisis in 
 course. These far -right and fascist policies not only do not oppose 
 to the EU, but they are "meat and blood". This is political perception

   This rotten building and exploiter also has 
 need a semblance of democracy to be sold to the people. AND' 
 the European Parliament must be used to disorient citizens and 
 convince them that you can change and fix. But the truth is that Parliament 
 European is a puppet without any significant and decisive function, one 
 show set up to deceive the peoples of Europe and to distract them from 
 their struggle. It is a "greenhouse" in which the lobby of the system grow, in which 
 The only thing that the so -called MEP obey are the "bags of 
 money "available to capitalists to promote their interests

   We support the struggles of peoples and workers. 
 These are the struggles that the governments of the EU countries are criticizing e 
 denigrating. We support the strikes that broke out in France for the law of 
 citizens to a pension to live with, the workers' strikes of 
 transport in Germany and Spain. We support the struggles of the farmers, such as 
 Recently in France and Greece. The continuation and the path to the 
 justice for the struggles of workers and peoples does not pass through 
 The acceptance of miserable illusions on the European Parliament and the EU. The 
 mobilizations of workers are the hope of a better future for 
 workers and peoples of Europe.
