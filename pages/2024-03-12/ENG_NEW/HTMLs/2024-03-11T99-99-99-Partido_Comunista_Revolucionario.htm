   To this situation are added the abuses and violence towards the feminisms and diversities of the misogynist and fascist Milei: the ministry closed, there is no budget to combat gender violence, with 75 femicides this year that is not simply a number that alarm, they are women whose lives snatched the sexist violence. They want to prohibit the law of voluntary interruption of pregnancy and eli. And they caused when on Friday morning they announced that the Women's Hall of the Casa Rosada would be renamed as Hall of the Próceres, replacing the Juana Azurduy box with that of the deliveryman and vendatria Carlos Menem.

   This massive national day expressed that we are not going to take a step back in defending the rights conquered with years of struggle and we give the fight for which we still have.

In Paraná, the unity between the two historical currents that have approached the Movement of Women and Feminist - the multisectoral of entrerrianan women and the assembly of women, lesbians, transvestites, trans and not binaries -, arises as the key to face reactionary policies and macho of Milei.
