 <p>
  After the avoidable death of a newborn in a hospital in the municipality of Manicoré, on March 6, the people of the city Se Rebelo and attacked the house of the mayor of the city, Lúcio Flávio (PSD) and sectors of the hospital. Afraid of the mass revolt, the old state responded by sending the shock troop to identify and arrest the protesters.
 </p>
 <p>
  The case began at the Dr. Hamilton Maia Cidade Regional Hospital, where on the same day, a one -day baby would have died due to medical complications. Residents and relatives of the newborn accuse, however, both medical and city neglect, who would not have been interested in providing the necessary assistance in time.

 <p>
  The answer of the masses, after the baby's funeral, was to summon a major demonstration that attacked part of the hospital's facilities and continued towards the mayor's own house, Lucio Flávio (PSD), who was not in residence at the time. With the help of a car, the pasta destroyed the gate and took the residence, demonstrating their fury against this injustice.
 </p>
 <p>
  In response to the rebellion, the municipal government called the Military Police shock troop. In a statement, the local government stated that: “Unacceptable acts of depredation and property damage will be faced with the full force of the law. The City Hall of Manicoré ensures that those responsible for these actions will be identified and will respond to the court for their conduct. ” In another note, the city still cynically accused residents of wanting to “politicize” a tragic event.
 </p>
 <p>
  The truth is that the case is not a “isolated incident” or even just a “tragic event”, but a symptom of public health destruction throughout Brazil and, in particular, in the state of Amazonas, as

  Jammed in crimes, mayor fears new rebellions
 </h4>
 <p>
  The main target of the demonstration, Mayor Lúcio Flávio (PSD), also maintains an extensive condemnation racing form, where he has already been pointed out by the court as author of “voting buy” actions during the 2016 elections, as well as using funds public to hire a PM for their “private security”.
 </p>
 <p>
  After the act, the politician's first action was to mobilize the city's security forces to keep his residence and, soon after, to seek a new shock troop team for the municipality. These actions demonstrate the profound dread of the reactionary in the face of a new survey of these masses, which narrowly not generalized a great revolt throughout the city.
