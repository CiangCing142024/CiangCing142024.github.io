 Divine indignation infiltrated the silk costumes and strangled their filthy vocal cords by the in -house and out -of -House of Livanists of a situation in the male and female exploitation. Class and not patriarchal. Covering the recent expression of "Sugar Daddies" of the Secretary -General of a rhetoric of a rhetorical and substantially valuable (for Greek things and a) reformist icon of the system.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Extravagant, outrageous. Mastrians are discouraged to honor virginity and morality in the beginning of the Capitalism of Capitalism!
 <span>

 <br/>
 End of provocative as well. There is no accusation and no accusation is allowed when there is a terrible phenomenon. On the contrary, its revelation is to be stoned. That is, something as a reward for ostriches, sanctification of voluntary and embellishment of exhaustion. The capture of the oligarchs costume is intelligent. We remove something unpleasant, as long as we don't mention it !! So it is important for the outside good testimony (out of the doll) and not at all in the inner atoms (plague).
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Unless those who recognize the timeless existence of prostitution (caring) within this driving force of profit and therefore commercialized society, live in a parallel universe. They narrate myths of a virtual reality of a false merciful and cross the angelically fired world of capitalist power.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But, because of the relics and grounding with the surroundings, this ancient (same chronology as the appearance of inequality) needed at least a small portion of the female (and less male) poverty to be issued flesh for a living? Therefore, this behavior is slanderous and criticized. Naive question. Unless all the houses of tolerance disappear as magic (identical to the perpetuation-decorating of a good-natured material way of production). Of course, all their formal and non -formal forms. At the living classical level of physical mumble, up to modern telephone, online and cinematic. From the "gentle" version of "voluntary" bump (paid and "consensual" rape), we were the last barbaric of sexual rape.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Fantasy Product the three -year -old circuit incident in Cologne with a twelve -year -old victim and perpetrator - under an orchestrated attempt at acquittal - neo -democratic executive? Like the countless police officers, who, when they do not open with student heads or do not shoot at the Roma ps, are engaged in the lucrative role of hard promotions (nineteen years in Ilioupoli, foreigners from Cameroon, Romania, etc.). In order not to expand to the dark interplay of state mechanisms with the underworld of the underworld and the organized crime. In Chania, the two priests who have repeatedly raped (otherwise the "Christian" priesthood crushes against gay marriage) with a mental retardation of a minor, are now compensated for their "unfair" time of detention!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Certainly- and unfortunately- some needy students will become erotic objects to secure tuition fees (one of the main aspirations of the Public Horse Rapid) at public universities. This is already the case on a limited scale and which will be expanded self -evolved after a sharp increase in study costs. Unless the student struggle overturns the law.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But of course the forces and executives and people are annoyed by the projection of aspects of their choleli Truth. Even when such a nays are unleashed by its representative from the left -wing breakwater of the resentment of the majority and a seemingly opponent. From the step of the Metropolitan Temple of their Iron Republic where the colossal lie is praised. That is to say, through his processes the people interfere with their fate.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Formulations of such style in times of attempted strangulation and criminalization of any ideological and practical challenge of the strategic directions of the system are undesirable, unacceptable. Their papal appearances are capable of microscopic differences from the opposition (for the proper functioning of the alternation of managers), while their rational, ethnocentrial policy will be applied by antenna. For any heretical derogation there is mockery, threats, persecution and prison railings. Macronisia and executions, at present are considered untimely.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The secretary swallowed his tongue with the ubiquitous firing of fire, which he received and almost apologetically blended by the seats of Parliament photographic evidence of his claim. After all, he was unable to repel the prime minister's anti -communist bile for the wide known extent of prostitution in the socialist camp. When, until the last moment of its collapse and the formal return to pure -blooded capitalism, its entirely awareness was praised by its disgust for decades before glooming derailment from the course of socialist construction. With a fatal consistency of all the inherent in the surface of the rotten system. It would be funny and contradiction, if he was in the wake, that the crash, a lawful system he praised, presented exactly all the common, shameless features with his authentic Mitsotakis.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 The rulers hate the truth by abusing the brutal. They are struggling to persuade that the policy of misery works for the good of our common national economy. How the future is erased auspicious. Private Higher Institutions will broaden the possibility of study. Establishing afternoon surgery improves care conditions. The disasters of water and fires are responsible for the vengeance of nature. Guilty to the mass crime in Tempi is raised by every random driver. Small nationalism -enormously defends the interests of the tribe and the drag in the full of diligence -the warrior war adventures of the western killers on the planet serves the security of the area!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 They were justifiably outraged by references to prostitution. Alas and crushed the sophisticated outer shell of cheating masses. They will be irreparably exposed and only the repressive and military armor will be left. Like slugs, they will hardly hide the disgusting aspect of themselves. Being a deep and widespread homeland, they ravaged it productively, so that the multinationals and stallions of mankind could benefit. Making it a five -star maid. They were degrading her dowries. They 'issue' on the sidewalks of sucking the labor force under the most impulsive terms. They are played for the conversion of every territory of territories into US -eating imperialism and at the same time Russia's nuclear targets. Without the slightest hesitation, the local dreamers are campaigning with their most selective iron, collaborating with Zionism - imperialism in the hell of the slaughter of the Palestinian people and the brutal attempt to crush their resistance.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Mitsotakis was angry with the semificant (and "uninformed" on him) in the hearing of the pupils. It is so cut for them that it erects inaccessible obstacles to their requirement to study. But myopic are his reflexes, as well as any other aspiring commander of the bourgeois state. As it begs the bosses the provision of compensatory benefits for the presence of bases. Promoting military tourism and promising the recreation (relief of sexual impulses) of the mercenary crews from the murderous hectics, often docked in Souda. No disruption was caused by the slide of his birthplace, which faithfully walks in the footsteps of the old infamous trumpet and endless borderell. According to his reasoning, it is not that it is negative, but when it is obviously named.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 There was no reckless of the cruel attack by the boss of the plutocracy against the leader of the party, which is captured by symbols, ideally the revolutionary traditions of the Left. So why so much in spite of the fresh, useful services of undermining rural and student uprising?
 <br/>
 <br/>
 After the first winning chapter and the staff of the round of the match against the popular forces, their registration remains. Especially from the unpredictable impulsivity of student youth. Certainly after sealing the successes will be followed by the next sweeping raid. It will be attempted to drain anything left of the old conquests and separates the dignity of the man's man from a collapsed sub -hall with zero rights in bread, studies, health care, pension and peace. They envision the end of their anti -popular campaign, probably when they manage to cross the feet of the proletarians and scratch the slave's body with the whip.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 So in order to achieve these critical goals, any perception of resistance to anti -populist storms in time must be tackled. Even if it is pronounced by formations, which acts hypocritically, but on the practitioner they are mines.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Terrorism and submission messages are sent in all directions and in all tones. The correctness of their view is redeemed. With fire and iron, their designs will be implemented.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 Do you hear what the muds are spread there? Prostitution; Disappeared. Working classroom? Bless you the employer that feeds you. Hunger and deprivation? Zero and decreasing. Accuracy; International issue. Unemployment; Alchemy of statistics shrinks it. Murders in the caterpillars? Carelessness of workers. Deliro repressive? Exclusively for the margin that crosses the serenity of the whole. Raise peasantry? Measures to adapt to new data. Studies, care? You pay, you have them. Nightmares of war risks? Integrated into the "right side of the story" to sleep long. At least as carefree they rest in Palestinian blood lakes, Syrians, Libyans, Iraqis, Ukrainians.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 When blatantly, sometimes screaming and as the language does not care, then with the persuasion of the bourgeois, they handle the enemy people. They have deafening speakers to disseminate their voice. They manage to cover his secluded, daily groaning of the carpenter and his anathema against them.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 But when they are transformed into slogans of protest and claim and join the streets of the struggles in mass, dynamic, organized, incompatible at once, the voice of the tyrants becomes a whisper, which erases in front of the people of the people.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 In this field, it stands out which - distinctly size - political power is dedicated to the popular affair. The Hera who launches the ungodly complaints and directs symbolic mobilizations along with the paralyzing gases of these - Messianic elections? Or the wheat that is constantly pushing the critical necessity to flood the roads of the struggles as the only way out of the Zofo, which spreads by the state of capital and imperialists?
