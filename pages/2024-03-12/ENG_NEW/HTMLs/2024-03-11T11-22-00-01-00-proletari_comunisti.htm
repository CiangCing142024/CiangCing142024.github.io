  Fincantieri is increasingly on 
 road of greater war production: in addition to Vario's military ships 
 type produced in Italy and abroad and sold all over the world now passes 
 Also to the direct production of torpedoes and sonar: “It is in advanced interviews with 
 Leonardo for the acquisition of Wass activities, the Livorno company that 
 It operates in the underwater industry, with the production of torpedoes and sonar ... "

  And the accounts are very good! 
 Fincantieri, in fact, according to his report: “he concluded 2023 with a 
 Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, devaluations e 
 of depreciation) of 397 million euros, recording an increase of approximately 
 80% compared to the previous year. Revenues grew by 2.8%, 
 reaching 7.651 billion euros ... and a cash generation of 200 
 millions ", and according to the CEO Folgiero will still grow in 
 2024: “provides for revenues of approximately 8 billion euros, up 4.5%, 
 respecting the targets of the industrial plan presented last May. 
 In addition, Ebitda Margin should stand around 6%, continuously 
 growing in line with the objectives of the plan. "

  This "accelerated" passage 
 Under diver's arms also seems to the fact that lately there have been 
 "Accidents" that damaged submarine cables for communications 
 (Internet): only in

  Red Sea “They would be 
 At least four damaged underwater cables ...: the AAE-1 cable 
 (Asia-Africa-Europa 1, 25 thousand kilometers long, from Southeast Asia 
 to Europe; The Seaucom cable (17 thousand kilometers cable connecting South Africa, 
 Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Gibuti, France and India); The Europe cable India Gateway 
 (EIG) of 15 thousand kilometers. At least for one of these cables there is confirmation 
 Damage officer: it is the Seaucom cable)

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  The tendency to an armament 
 more and more complete and aggressive in all fields it is confirmed, as well as yes 
 confirms the collaboration with Leonardo S.p.A, all e

  This modern fascist government, 
 As we have already said, it is active, in one way or another, in the massacres in 
 course of peoples such as the Palestinians, and not only wants to dismantle everything that 
 represents an obstacle to the profits made with the production and sale of weapons a 
 Anyone who wants to buy them, in violation of the Constitution and the laws 
 Italian, like 185/90, but acts with rearmament in all sectors.

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  It is therefore necessary to continue 
 to manifest against the imperialist war and fight against the government
