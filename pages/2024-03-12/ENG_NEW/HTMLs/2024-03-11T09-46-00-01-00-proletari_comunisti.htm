   The chemical pole of Spinetta Marengo is like a huge drift iceberg. That Solvay did not face even after the Cassation sentence. Indeed, he acute it, not even managed to check the PFAS. THE

   The claim of

   All in all he would limit himself to eliminating the tip of the iceberg, but Solvay perceives it as a "Trojan horse" to conquer the entire spinettese chemical stronghold. And precisely on the Pfas Solvay today erected its "Maginot line": and after having

   Following this directive, Solvay would not worry about the directors, adequately paid for the "professional" risk, to the present: Andrea Diotto and Stefano Bigini, but at most for
   <b>
    pecuniary penalties:
   </b>
   The sanctions come up

    Solvay hides behind the authorizations (AIA) of the province of Alessandria.
   </b>
   According to the previous EU directive on environmental crimes, until a company respected the conditions of an authorization, it claimed that its actions were not considered illegal. An example, told by Antonius Manders concerns the judicial case of the Dutch chemical industry

   On the eve of the second trial against Solvay, Greenpeace warns
   <em>
    <span face="Calibri, sans-serif">
     “We cannot always hope for the judiciary as a guarantor of any dispute. If there are unequivocal data and numbers, the legislator must intervene. Instead, compared to the Pfas case, politics has consciously decided not to intervene in recent years. But which side are the institutions, with industrial lobbies or with public interest? ".
