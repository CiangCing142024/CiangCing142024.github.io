   On the eve of the Council Chamber at the Court of L'Aquila 
 On the extradition in Israel of the Palestinian political refugee 
 Anan Yaesh, and while mounting mobilization throughout the national territory for its liberation and against its extradition, 2 other Palestinian refugees were arrested this morning by Digos at the request of the Public Prosecutor of L'Aquila, 
 District Anti -Mafia and Anti -terrorism Directorate, in coordination with the National Prosecutor.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: verdana;">
   According to the accusation 
 An operational structure called “Group would have been established 
 quick response - Brigades Tulkarem ”, filiation would seem 
 of the brigades of the martyrs of Al-Aqsa, which has among its objectives 
 acts of violence against the state of Israel. The brigades to the AQSA, 
 relating to Al Fatah, at the request of Israel have been inserted 
 from the European Union in the black list of organizations 
 terrorist.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: verdana;">
   For all three arrested 
 An extradition procedure has been activated on stress 
 of the Israeli authorities.
  </span>
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: verdana;">
   The accusations against Anan were obviously not effective enough to quickly obtain the extraction, as is also deduced from the intervention of his lawyer yesterday during the garrison at the Terni prison, where he relaunched, in addition to that of 12 tomorrow in L'Aquila, Also another important date for national mobilization, that of March 20 in Rome at the Court of Cassation

 <p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-family: verdana;">
   The timing, to say the least suspect, between the hearing and these new arrests push us to relaunch the mobilization more forcefully. Below is the appeal of the Aquila coordination for Palestine:

 <p style="text-align: center;">
  <b>
   <span style="font-family: verdana;">
    No to the entication for Anan and to the torture of the Palestinians, the eagle calls to mobilization
   </span>
  </b>
 </p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;">
  <i>
   <span style="font-family: verdana;">
    The Aquila coordination for Palestine tomorrow in garrison to 
 Court for the hearing on the release of Anan Yaeesh
   </span>
  </i>
 </p>
 <p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
  <span style="font-family: verdana;">
   <br/>
   With 
 A perfect timing, a few hours after the hearing to the Court of Appeal 
 of the L'Aquila in which the request for release of 
 Anan Yaeesh, three other arrest mandates were carried out in the 
 Night at L'Aquila. One of the three concerns Anan himself. Particular 
 that a arrest warrant is issued the day before in which it comes 
 The request for release is discussed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The accusations are of 
 International terrorism and subversion. The media, bringing back so 
 Certosino what has been suggested by the Police Headquarters, they even refer 
 the preparation of suicidal attacks. Meanwhile, in this 
 context, and with these heavy accusations, people arrested again 
 they do not have access to their file, nor do they know anything, except that they are 
 Be took from home to dawn and transferred to prison. 
 Exactly as it happened in Anan in late January.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   There 
 In short, we would amaze if the accusations proved unfounded, 
 Considering Italian collaborationism with a correspondence status 
 Like Israel. It is clear that in the ethnic cleaning project 
 perpetrated by the Jewish state also enters the elimination of 
 Palestinian people who live abroad, often by virtue 
 of the political persecution to which they were subjected to the territories 
 illegally occupied. In our city and in our country there is a 
 very heavy climate against dissent, against those who try to oppose a 
 a genocide that is underway thanks also to the complicity 
 of Italy. Against those who dare questioning a meaning 
 Unique and totalizing.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For this it is important to raise the 
 voice against the request for extradition from those who constantly violate e 
 For decades human rights and international law has killed 
 30 thousand people in 4 months, forces a apartheid, deport one whole 
 Population and torture the prisoners, even minors.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   For 
 This we reiterate how much more important it is to be present at 
 Presidium of tomorrow 12 March, at 11, at the Court of via XX 
 September in L'Aquila. We invite the population of L'Aquila and the 
 country to mobilization.
