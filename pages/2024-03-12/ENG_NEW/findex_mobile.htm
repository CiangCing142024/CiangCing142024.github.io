   In the following we would like to publish a report that we will receive from the Red Bund NRW to the campaigns on March 8th.
  </em>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On March 8th of the International Women's Campaign Day, we took part in two demonstrators as a red bundle in North Rhine-Westphalia.
  <br>
<br>
  In Cologne, we took part in the central demonstration on March 8 with a relatively large, young and combative quota, in which over 1,000 demonstrators took part. The demonstration was used by the participants to turn different actions out of the demonstration and to ignite pyrotechnics. As part of the demonstration, we distributed the leaflets of the Red Women's Committee on March 8th and, together with a megaphone together with the surrounding demonstration participants, consistently tangled combative-feminist parolen against the double oppression of women through imperialism and patriarchy. Many of the participants expressed their approval that the support for the fight of the people of Palestine as a fight against imperialism together with the fight against the patriarchy must be led and were happy about the demonstration invitations to the Palestine demonstration in Bochum on March 22nd 6 p.m. at the Schauspielhaus in Bochum.

   Comrade Lenin is the leader of the international proletariat and the great mentor of Marxism -Leninism.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  “
  <strong>
   We are the army established by Comrade Lenin, a great proletarian strategy. Nothing has a higher honor than this army. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin).
 </p>
<p>
<a>
</a>
  As shown in the pages of history, on January 21, 1924, the immortal Comrade Lenin was the world's worker class and the great leader who oppressed the people, and the second great milestone of Marxist Maoism. He left an inestimable great heritage. Comrade Lenin's doctrine has changed the foundation of the "future body" laid from Marx and Engels from abstract possibilities to specific reality. , Still sufficient significance. In order to correct yourself in the class struggle, you must accept this "reality" and position yourself here. This "reality" is also a good medicine to deal with improvementism, amendments and parliamentary fans. These ideas mean the surrender and compromise of any form of dominant ideology. This "reality" is the guarantee of the conviction and determination to establish the communist world.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   As a mentor of Communistism, Lenin broke the deadlock and paved the way to oppose the process of opposing international reactionists and corremists.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Correctly recognizing the contradictions in the history of class struggle and grasping the time of historical breaks, and preparing for these breaks are the most prominent feature of Comrade Lenin's lifelong immortal struggle. After Marx and Engels died, the leadership of the international proletariat was taken over by the opportunityist of the Second International for a long time. In the words of Comrade Stalin
  <strong>
   : "During this period, the second international political parties cannot continue the theoretical struggle that the international proletariat and the world are oppressed from the influence of the influence of the social Democrats of the social Democratic party, which are opportunistic and class compromise. In addition to the theoretical struggle that is oppressed by the world, with the establishment of the Communist International, he has developed a form of dynamic organization and struggle suitable for the new period of capitalist class struggle. "
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin liberated the Communist Party and the Communist International from the restraint of the legal struggle in the legal struggle, and turned the Communist Party and the Communist International into a war tool against the bourgeoisie.
  <strong>
   ：“
  </strong>
<strong>
   There are no revolutionary policies, but relaxed vulgarism and dirty politics bargaining, and parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary conspiracy. Of course, for the sake of appearance, they passed the "revolutionary" resolution and slogan.
  </strong>
<strong>
   ”
  </strong>
  But it "stored in the drawer in the office" has got rid of the constraints of the form of legal struggle.
  <strong>
   "At the same time, the new period of the imperialist war and the proletarian revolutionary struggle is coming. In the face of the omnipotent of financial capital, the old combat method is proven to be obviously insufficient and weak. Reform thoroughly, reform all its working methods, and remove all vulgarism, narrow thoughts, politicians' style of drama, rebellious social sand literaryism and social peaceism. It is necessary to check the entire thermal arsenal of the Second International and throw away all rust of rust. And forging new weapons. Without this preliminary work, it is useless to start against capitalism. Without this work, the proletariat may find that it is insufficient for armed forces in the future revolutionary struggle, or even There is no armed at all. The honor of the second international Ode Asl (here to accumulate the accumulation of accumulation of accumulation), the honor of comprehensive reform and large cleaning has fallen on Leninism's shoulders. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin, "On the Basis of Leninism")
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin seized the core of the contradiction with his talent. He realized that if you do not get rid of the burden of suppressing the international proletariat, different amendments and opportunism are struggled, and the theoretical and practical nature of these views will not be shown to the masses. Enough effectiveness and success. By establishing a dialectical and inevitable connection between the establishment of "internal struggle" and "external struggle", he made double struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin left a very important lesson for the Communists, that is, the struggle against revisionism and opportunism, and the struggle of the reactionaries against the imperialism and all forms was inseparable. On the contrary, in the struggle against imperialism, we must clear the amendments and opportunist ideas in their own teams.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   In the increasingly acute contradictions of the imperialist system, Lenin's teaching
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin's system of imperialism in detail in the early 20th century was still retained in the past time, but its contradiction is still sharp, and it is in a spiral rise of conflicts that cannot be resolved. Although the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the integration of capitalism in China have not erupted the contradictions for the time being, the law of uneven development of capitalism continues. This system is in crisis, and the previous "solutions" are no longer effective. The imperialists have long transferred their own burdens to the semi -colonial land, and they can also come here to delay their crisis by deepening their plundering to delay their crisis.
 </p>
<p>
  One of the contradictions of the inherent problems of the imperialist system developed according to Lenin's definition of imperialism is one of the internal struggles of imperialist imperialism in various forms in recent years. It is currently being launched in local war. When Lenin enumerated the contradictions of imperialism, mentioning that the internal contradictions of imperialism are one of the three most important contradictions.
 </p>
<p>
  We can see that the development of the situation is in line with Comrade Lenin's observation of the nature and contradictions of imperialism:
  <strong>
   "The second contradiction is the contradiction between the financial groups and the powers of imperialism to compete for raw materials and compete for other territories. Imperialism is to output capital to the origin of raw materials, which is crazy for the original raw material origin. The struggle is to fight the world that has been divided by the melon, which is to find the new financial group and the powers who are looking for "under the sun" to seize the old financial groups and the powers who are not released from death and the powers. Fighting. The characteristics of this crazy struggle between capitalist groups are the inevitable factor that contains the war of imperialist war and a war to seize the territory of other countries. Weaken each other, weaken the entire capitalist position, approach the timing of the proletarian revolution, and make the proletarian revolution. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin, "On the Basis of Leninism")
 </p>
<p>
  The two former socialist countries, Russia and China, have provided an opportunity to breathe the imperialist system through their own new markets. They have become the main participants in the internal competition of imperialism and compete with the United States as an hegemonic country. This means that as new and powerful participants are increasingly participating in the struggle of re -distribution of territory, the degree and nature of contradictions will increase. The great confrontation with the Russianist invasion of Ukraine happened in this context. It is foreseeable that this trend will further deepen and spread. As long as there is no direct confrontation between imperialism, the regions where territorial redistributions are assigned to the semi -colonial and colonies. The semi -colonial and oppressed people in the world will continue to pay for these wars until the imperialists directly declare war.
 </p>
<p>
  In this way, the world has split into a few imperialist countries and most of the oppressed countries -Lenin cleverly analyzed this -and deepened this. The third contradiction is sharply sharp with the various plundering of imperialism, and accompanied by the powerful national liberation war and the people's war of the imperialist system with the upward trend of the semi -colonial and semi -feudal countries.
 </p>
<p>
  In the process of being in their own internal contradictions and the contradictions between their own internal contradictions and the contradictions of the oppressed people and the oppressed nation, all parts of the rule system, especially the imperialist countries, have become more concentrated. The same militarism and good emotions as in the past paved the way for all fascist emotions and brought society into the corresponding ideological style. This is either realized by the so -called right -wing extremists, or under the veil of the Social Democratic or Liberal Party. The reality of the Communists and the oppressed people in the world, in the face of the increasingly reactionary and aggressive system, requires a Leninist party to lead the proletariat to fight for power from the proletariat. Essence Only such a party is now the party of Marx Lenin's Mao Zeduism, can we lead an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Lenin's great heritage, Leninism's concept of the party, is the general staff of the proletariat
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   The revolution is not to dinner, not to do articles, not painting and embroidery. It cannot be so elegant. Revolution is a riots, a violent action of a class overthrowing a class.
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong)
 </p>
<p>
  How the Communists define the contradictions of the existence and how they position themselves in the development of the situation. In the 100 years after Comrade Lenin's death, imperialists have turned their dominance structure into larger machines. Their army, police, Special Service Bureau, etc. all have their unparalleled ability in the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of the person who claims to be "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignores this reality (even if it seems to be accepted theory), and it is far from positioning itself according to it. However, by following the ideological and practical reconciliation line, the working class and the oppressed masses are locked in the rule of the masses in the rule of the rule, and served as a dyke. When imperialists and exploiters are equipped with more and more violent equipment and institutions for themselves, as followers of Comrade Lenin, it is necessary to carry out strong ideological struggles and oppose those who claim to be "revolutionaries" and "Communist Communities" and "Communist Communities". People of doctrine are more and more away from the reality of the revolution and revolutionary struggle on the basis of weapons and violence. Guided by Comrade Lenin's unremitting struggle against the second international opportunism, it was one of the important tasks of the centennial death of Comrade Lenin's death.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin defines the new Communist Party as "the war organization of the proletariat." This definition is necessary due to the corresponding position of the imperialist system and class. The process of triggering the October Revolution and the civil war that broke out with the October Revolution was the specific reason why Comrade Lenin said the Communist Party was the "proletarian war organization". The Communist Party, which leads the proletariat and the liberation of the masses, must have this characteristic, but the counter -revolutionary is armed with violent machines and means from top to bottom, and all these terrible massacres are on the working class and the oppressed people. The revolutionary war needs a party to launch it. Only the fools who rely on the bourgeoisie and the irregular amendments have other opinions on this.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Some people laughed at us as the supporters of the "Universal War". Yes, we are the supporters of the omnipotent revolutionary war. This is good, not bad, this is Marxism. The Russian Communist Party's gun created socialism. We will establish a democratic Republic. The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us that the working class and the workers can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords only with the power of guns. In this sense, we can say that only with guns can change the entire world.
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong)
 </p>
<p>
  The International Communist Alliance has determined the construction and reorganization of the Communist Party as an important task in the fighting of the Communist Party at its establishment conference. Comrade Mao Zedong's understanding of the Communist Party was the understanding of Comrade Lenin, and it was also enriched by Stalin. It was the realization of the party's understanding of the party in Marxism -Leninism. During our imperialism and proletarian revolution, we can oppose the increasing aggressiveness of the imperialist reactionaries, and the Communist Party, which can lead the proletarian and the world's oppression of the people, must have the quality of the "proletarian war organization".
 </p>
<p>
  An important heritage of Lenin is to take political power as the basic issue of every revolution. Lenin stated,
  <strong>
   "There is no violence on the bourgeois state machines, and no new state machines are replaced by it. The proletarian revolution is impossible."
  </strong>
  ,as well as
  <strong>
   "Except for power, everything is fantasy."
  </strong>
  Essence Under Lenin's personal leadership, the world's first socialist country and proletarian dictatorship was established, and the road of the proletariat obtained power and maintained it.
 </p>
<p>
  After the death of Lenin, it was his successor Stalin's outstanding definition of Leninism, further developing Leninism, and making it the basis of the entire international communist movement. On the great Lenin's shoulders, Chairman Mao was able to push the world's proletarian revolution to a higher level and develop the ideological form of the proletariat. Today's Leninism, now Marxism -Leninism, must be accepted, defended and applied.
 </p>
<p>
  As a member of the International Communist Alliance, we will continue to complete the task proposed by the great Lenin and better use the heritage left by Comrade Lenin.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin, the great mentor of the international proletariat and Marx Lenin Mao Zedongism, leads us in the current era to lead us to fight for the world's proletarian revolution.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Long live Marx Lenin Mao Zedongism!
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   Long live proletarian internationalism!
  </strong>

Founded by the Comintern in 1920, Red Aid in 1923 declared the 18th of March, the date of the founding of the  Paris  Commune,  the  "International  Day  of  Solidarity  with  Political  Prisoners"  and dedicated it to political prisoners. On the 18th of March, solidarity with political prisoners is expressed worldwide. In every period of history, there has been great resistance to the systems of exploitation and oppression in which we have lived for thousands of years, and a high price has been paid. The reaction of the ruling classes to every struggle against the ruling systems of exploitation, to every resistance, has been similar: to crush every movement against their existence in order to preserve their existence and, above all, to destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has built up against the ruling order, the dynamism that comes from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right direction under the right leadership. That is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel the people's  anger  and  desire  for  change  and  isolate  from  the  people  those  who  cannot  be destroyed. The other dimension of the intolerance and aggression of the ruling classes against the  revolutionary,  communist  and  democratic  popular  movements  is  to  ensure  that  the oppressed masses of the people remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and suppressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed masses of the people: "If you act against us, we will do the same to you". "Philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change  it"  said  Karl  Marx,  the  great  master  of  the  proletariat.  Communists  and<br/><br/> revolutionaries  fight for the  realization of  this  ideal,  they  are murdered  for it,  they  are imprisoned for it. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown again and again in torture centers and prisons that as long as life goes on, great examples can be created for the continuation of the class struggle under all living conditions. The way requires taking these risks and it is with this consciousness that communists and revolutionaries fight against the ruling systems of exploitation. The body of every murdered communist and revolutionary, every time spent in prison also lays the foundation for building the society of the future. The bourgeoisie and its lackeys want to ensure the capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered  in  prisons  under  the  most  oppressive  conditions.  The  communist  and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to turn the prisons, where the enemy feels strongest, into an arena of class struggle. For this reason, we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis  of  their  justice  and  embrace  them.  Communists  and  revolutionaries  are  not  only murdered,  imprisoned  and  tortured  because  they  have  alternative  ideas  to  the  existing systems of exploitation, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is first and foremost an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable  classes.  Since  the  objective  conditions  of  the  imperialist  system  keep  the contradiction  between  the  oppressor  and  the  oppressed  constant  and  current,  the assassination  and  imprisonment  of  communists  and  revolutionaries  does  not  solve  the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the deepening contradictions are directly reflected in the class contradictions and the gap of the murdered and imprisoned revolutionaries and communists is filled with new ones.  To the extent that the contradictions of the ruling system deepen and its impasses multiply, to the extent that their fear of the "gravedigger" grows, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their true character more and more concretely. At the same time, the deepening and unresolved crisis of the system is leading the bourgeoisie and the exploiting ruling classes of all kinds to centralize the mechanism of the sovereign State more strongly, both with its laws and its de facto organizations, and to bring the mechanisms of oppression more to the fore. In the  imperialist  capitalist  countries,  which  call  themselves  "ideal"  and  "progressive democracies", the successive security laws, the new laws extending the powers of the State repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left behind the ability to wear the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie is re-establishing its position against the working class,  the  oppressed  laborers  and  the  oppressed  peoples  with  all  its  reactionism.  In  the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, parliamentary and extra- parliamentary forms of government with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual  regimes.  In  these  countries,  all  oppositionists,  starting  with  the  communists  and revolutionaries, are subjected to systematic and permanent State terror. The depth of the contradiction  between  the  ruling  classes  and  the  oppressed  people  in  these  countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, who can only maintain the servitude of imperialism through an unbridled regime of terror against the people, State terror is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are only a cover for fascism, reaction and State terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The<br/><br/>ruling  classes  of  Turkey,  India,  the  Philippines,  Peru,  Iran,  Israel  etc.  are  deepening  the isolation they label with almost all the letters of the alphabet in order to capture the prisoners in the prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many  sick  prisoners  are  left  to  die  and  there  are  repeated  actual  attacks  on  prisoners. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are caught in prisons as the price of the Kurdish national  liberation  struggle.  In  Turkish  prisons,  the  release  of  people  who  have  been imprisoned for more than 30 years is prevented on the grounds that they "do not give up their thoughts". The reactionary Indian State has locked up over ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha to pre vent the People’s War. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by US imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed peoples from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons. The ruling classes' fear of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enmity they  feel  towards  them  is  so  great  that  they  ruthlessly  prevent  the  communists  and revolutionaries  they  hold  captive  in  open  violation  of  their  own  laws  from  leaving  the prisons. The assassination of Chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health  after  29  years  in  solitary  confinement  and  whose  death  was  caused  because  the necessary measures were not taken, is very imp ortant to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the ruling system. Those responsible for the death of  Chairman Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. The communist and revolutionary prisoners in the prisons are trying to fulfill the demands of the class struggle at the risk of their lives by going to the limits of prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to resist all kinds of pressure, torture and solitary confinement.  We  must  mobilize  to  support  the  legitimate  struggle  and  resistance  of  the prisoners, to fight against any kind of aggression against the prisoners, to be the voice of the prisoners outside, we must support their struggle under the conditions of imprisonment as part of the class struggle outside. THE COMMUNIST AND REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS ARE OUR HONOR! SUPPORTING THE COMMUNIST AND REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS MEANS SUPPORTING THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE! LET US MAKE THE RESISTANCE AND STRUGGLE OF THE COMMUNIST AND REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS OUR OWN. LET US BE THE VOICE OF THE PRISONERS! International Communist League March 2024</p></div>

  For an event in Store Vega for March 8, working women's international match day, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, along with a lot of other bourgeois politicians and ministers, had been invited to speak. However, the prime minister only managed to give her speech for a few seconds before she was greeted with pro-Palestinian calls like "Mette Frederiksen, stop your hypocrisy!".
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  The evening of March 8, the Kvinfo organization had organized a "Knowledge Center for Gender and Equality" filled with speeches and other shows to mark the day of match. Here the Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was to Keep speech and participate with many other bourgeois ministers and politicians. The bourgeois politicians had hoped to be able to spread their hypocritical speeches and try to abuse on March 8 to reconcile through their imperialist feminism. However, these dreams were crushed as soon as Mette Frederiksen was to go up the stage and give his speech.

At the same time, a large Palestine Fate and other political banners with progressive passwords were folded out over the balconies of the hall.

      Left Vega tonight without holding 8 March. Had been looking forward to me, but it became unsafe and the prime minister was harassed by the stage of loud cries.

  All in all, the evening was a total failure of the highest representatives of Danish imperialism in the Folketing, who directly have the blood of the Palestinian people on their hands. What should have been a day filled with reconciliation and bourgeois peace ended up in a major political and moral defeat for them. The Danish bourgeoisi and their representatives in the Folketing continue to actively support and profits on the genocide in Gaza, but at the same time they cannot withstand the must as soon as they are confronted with the consequences for their actions. Therefore, they do as they always do, and whine in front of the bourgeois press as if they were the victims just because someone criticized them for their active support for genocide.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-justify">
  Politicians may well continue their new strategy of quietly quietly supporting support for the genocide against the Palestinian people, while actively supporting Israel and giving them guarantees behind the scenes. But their empty words and crocodile tears cannot hide their evil deeds from the people and they continue to be revealed every single day.

 the European Parliament must be used to disorient citizens and

   We support the struggles of peoples and workers. 
 These are the struggles that the governments of the EU countries are criticizing e 
 denigrating. We support the strikes that broke out in France for the law of

 transport in Germany and Spain. We support the struggles of the farmers, such as

  </strong>
<strong>
   Week the military exercise "Cold Response" was implemented. The exercise is led by the Norwegian military and is part of NATOS
  </strong>
<strong>
   Strategic activities in the Nordic countries in general and the Barents region in particular.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  The exercise was first held in 2006, and this year's exercise is claimed to be the largest of its kind ever in the region. The exercise is carried out as part of the so-called "steadfast defender" exercise, which this year has been referred to as the largest military exercise since the Cold War.
 </p>
<p>
  The Norwegian military writes that over 20,000 soldiers participate in the exercise, and that the participants come from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and the United States.
 </p>
<p>
  This year's exercise is reportedly conducted in Norway, Sweden and Finland, and as a result of Finland's incorporation into NATO, the name of "Nordic Response" has changed.
 </p>
<p>
  - There will be particularly great activity at sea with over 50 registered submarines, frigates, corvettes, aircraft carriers and various amphibious vessels, the Norwegian military writes on its website.
 </p>
<p>
  The escalated military activity must be seen on the basis of the general crisis and decay in imperialism. Imperialism wraps itself in increasingly strong contradictions and is desperately trying to get out of them in the only way it knows, through more and more military renovation and reaction.

  Fincantieri is increasingly on 
 road of greater war production: in addition to Vario's military ships 
 type produced in Italy and abroad and sold all over the world now passes 
 Also to the direct production of torpedoes and sonar: “It is in advanced interviews with 
 Leonardo for the acquisition of Wass activities, the Livorno company that 
 It operates in the underwater industry, with the production of torpedoes and sonar ... "

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
  And the accounts are very good! 
 Fincantieri, in fact, according to his report: “he concluded 2023 with a 
 Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, devaluations e 
 of depreciation) of 397 million euros, recording an increase of approximately 
 80% compared to the previous year. Revenues grew by 2.8%, 
 reaching 7.651 billion euros ... and a cash generation of 200 
 millions ", and according to the CEO Folgiero will still grow in 
 2024: “provides for revenues of approximately 8 billion euros, up 4.5%, 
 respecting the targets of the industrial plan presented last May. 
 In addition, Ebitda Margin should stand around 6%, continuously 
 growing in line with the objectives of the plan. "

  This modern fascist government,

<p>
   March 8 as International Women's Day is a day of international solidarity with all women and, most importantly, to demonstrate the strength of proletarians, despite their double exploitation.
  </p>
<p>
   For communists, 8M keeps great importance because in 1917 women with courage they consecrated their life for a just cause, which was the socialist revolution. Women with stones, sticks, snowballs became fire and slogans against tsarism, thus demonstrated to the capital that workers are warts and that their oppression in an intolerable situation of pain and misery, were not enough to reduce fury with the fury with that the workers fought to impose a system that would support them and allow them to have their long -awaited freedom.
  </p>
<p>
   With this action it was shown that the wait and faith deposited in the state of the exploiters is idealistic, the story has already taught us many times that the capital did not attack the same and that it cannot be transformed from the inside. Our salvation only depends on us, workers who fight with our classmates.
  </p>
<p>
   The gender struggle detached from the class struggle is nothing more than an ideology professed directly by the exploiters (men and women); The bourgeois gender struggle puts everything upside down and serves the bourgeoisie to keep us oppressed. Therefore, talking about gender equality in a class society is only demagogy.
  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
   Feminism bases its struggle on obtaining the same privileges as exploiters, so it has demonstrated their great failure when solving the problems of proletarians; Its weakening is evidenced with fragmentation within their struggle, creating supposed new feminisms that would respond to our interests, but even their speeches and their actions are weak against the great oppression that poor women live. This comes from its resignation to the class struggle for what are subordinated, without realizing, to bourgeois ideology.
  </p>
<p>
   Of course, the communists oppose machismo, homophobia and transphobia of the bourgeois institutions of the State, we wake up tire Great: For the liberation and abolition of all forms of discrimination, exploitation and oppression that we live in this disgusting bourgeois society, and for this great objective we need all the groups that suffer: men, women, children, young people, mothers, poor, poor and Oppressed from Colombia and the world.
  </p>
<p>
   The communists who attended Cali at the march of 8m with our fighting partners, were censored by the media and photographs at the reason of claiming the class struggle and not of gender. We understand that the bourgeoisie, in her desire to keep women oppressed with their postmodern theories, attack us in front of the ideological, political and economic field, in this case it was both political and ideological, because we closed the possibility of demonstrating What our posters and slogans said, our positions were not collected by the media in the same way as the bourgeois and reformist slogans of feminism.
  </p>
<p>
   In this march also attended the PCC and the Juco, that is, the bourgeois ideology also dressed in red, because the opportunistic revisionism in its eagerness to follow fashion and get rid of all class speech is infected by these old ideologies and follow the foot these individualistic trends, which leave for the latest the class struggle, so they dressed as "aliades" of feminism, caricaturizing the figures of great revolutionary such as Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai, deceiving the protesters of what is the Fight for socialism, because almost for any woman who attended 8M is a secret that these organizations cover up and exert violence against women, discrediting the revolutionary struggle, to the point that women were cautious of any apparent influence of these organizations. We live in our own flesh that we tell them because when we approached the MFR platform, some girls said in the distance that, if they give them something of the juco or the PCC they would throw it away, break it or burn it, so we had To clarify that we are a totally different organization, we clarify again and by our media to all the compas that not everyone who looks red is from the juco or the PCC Mamerto.

<p>
   Companions, it is time to forget those bourgeois divisions and unite against a single and true enemy: capital. Unite with strength and freedom as Russian women, such as Chinese and like many of our mothers who, despite the double exploitation and precariousness situation in the oppressive system, led us to be great women and men.

  No to the complicity between Italy and Israel
  <br>
  No to the entry of 
 Anan Yaeesh
  <br>
<br>
  On January 27, 2024 the Italian authorities have 
 arrested, in the city of L'Aquila, Anan Yaeesh, following a 
 request for extradition made by the Israeli authorities.
  <br/>
  Anan, 
 37 years old, he is a Palestinian from the city of Tulkarem in the West Bank. 
 Leads its political activity within the second 
 Intifada and discounts over 4 years in employment prisons. In the 
 2006, following an ambush of the Israeli special forces, 
 reports serious injuries for the blows inflicted on him.
  <br/>
  In 2013 he leaves 
 Palestine directed towards Europe. He goes to Norway where he comes 
 subjected to surgery to remove bullets 
 remained in his body for years. In 2017 he arrives in Italy where in 
 2019 obtains a regular residence permit. In 2023 he went to 
 Visit to Jordan, but is kidnapped by the Giordani security service 
 For all probability, to deliver it to Israel. After 
 over six months of detention, in order to avoid discontent e 
 reactions by public opinion is released.
  <br/>
  TO 
 November 2023, his city of 
 residence where it is arrested.
  <br/>
  The decision by 
 of Italy to proceed with the arrest and extradition of Anan is of 
 enormous gravity. Italy would deliver to the Israeli authority a 
 Palestinian citizen on the basis of hypothetical resistance actions 
 in the occupied territories. The concern for the current situation 
 It is in the certainty that, in the event of extradition, Anan will be conducted 
 before a military court and subjected to inhuman treatments e 
 serious prison conditions. The numerous relationships of organizations e 
 of international associations report the 
 inhumane conditions of detention and torture in prisons 
 Israeli.
  <br/>
  Also, we believe this episode risks 
 represent a dangerous previous aimed at customs clearance 
 Palestinians' extradition and delivery in Italy and Europe 
 Upon request for Israel who, remember, carry on 
 A military employment of the Palestinian territories.
  <br/>
  We invite 
 all realities, committees, unions, organizations 
 political, social and solidarity with Palestine, a 
 create moments of mobilization, starting from March 9 in front of 
 Prefectures, to oppose extract and to ask the government 
 Italian the immediate release of Anan.

  An operation carried out on March 7 at the headquarters of “Santa Érica Farm”, divided between Maranhão and Pará, exposed a true arsenal maintained by the “security guards” (gunmen) of the Finger family landowners. The warehouse had almost a dozen long weapons, “tactical” ammunition and equipment such as vests, balaclavas and knives. The farm is accused of being the result of land grabbing and is in a territory of 12,000 hectares where about 10 peasant communities live. In addition to the weapons, two men (“security guards”) and a woman, who worked as a cook, were arrested.
 </p>
<p>
  The operation occurred after several mobilizations in the region that exposed and denounced the crimes committed by gunmen at the service of landowners in the region. The peasants also denounce the involvement of repressive forces with their own gun.
 </p>
<p>
  Since November last year, the repressive forces in the region, demoralized by the exposure of involvement with the large farmers, have moved a true campaign of persecution against the peasants of the community. At the same time as the police carried out the operation against the Santa Érica Farm, the Civil Police also served an arrest warrant and several of search and seizure against the peasants of the village Vilela. A resident was arrested,

   accused of assaulting a PM during a protest on November 29, 2023
  </a>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  The successive and constant operations against peasants stress that, despite the searches and punctual seizures against landowners, almost always motivated by the scan of crimes through massive popular mobilization, the repressive forces of the state are at the service of large farmers. Union of Communities in Fighting (UCL) denounces that, in addition to operations against the gun seek to “clean” the appearances of the Civil Police after proven involvement of the repressive forces with the landlord, the search and seizure warrant was unsuccessful to demobilize O

<p>
  On March 5, the Guarani-Kaiowá of the Indigenous Land (TI) Sasoró, from the city of Tacuru, Mato Grosso do Sul, locked the MS-295 highway in protest for the lack of water that had reached the site 16 consecutive days. The community, with more than 2,200 inhabitants, blocked the road that gives access to Iguatemi and is one of the main ways to southern Brazil and an important latifundal grain flow route. With the combative lock, a technician from the MS Special Sanitary Sanitary District (DSEI) went to the scene stating that a survey will be conducted to investigate the issue. Protesters gave a period of 15 days for the problem to be resolved. Otherwise, they are willing to perform new protest actions.
 </p>
<p>
  While water is lacking for the Guarani-Kaiowá, there are promises of pro-latifundium governor Eduardo Riedel (PSDB), who was in the city of Tacuru on 03/04. The announcement of R $ 17.9 million in infrastructure and education for the municipality did not even contemplate a real for indigenous peoples from there. Backly, Riedel sat next to Mayor Rogério Torquetti (Patriota) and Tacuru City Council to announce the “universalization of the service” of basic sanitation. The mayor stated that the funds went to “priority projects”, but nothing was done with the top truck that recently stopped circulating for mechanical problems and helped supply the village-distant 35km from the city headquarters.

  The problem, an expression of the bureaucratic-latifundity character of the old Brazilian state, is spread in the state. Just under two months ago in Dourados - a city 200 km from Tacuru - the inhabitants of the villages Jaguapiru and Bororo also
  <a href="https://anovademocracia.com.br/ms-indigenas-trancam-rodovia-contra-falta-de-agua-na-reserva-indigena-de-dourados/">
   blocked a highway due to lack of water
  </a>
  . While other villages in the state report the same situation, the State Government announced, at the end of February, at its official site, that "awaits the position of the Union to send solution to water shortage in the villages." It is the classic position of the ruling classes, who play their responsibilities to each other. Not that Luiz Inacio's government has no responsibility for it. On the contrary, your

   “Privatist bias” in indigenous health
  </a>
  , as the Missionary Indigenous Council (CIMI) denounced, it certainly has part of it. Even the indigenous people know this and some posters quoted Weib Tapeba, the Secretary of Indigenous Health of the Ministry of Health.

  A few days before the highway block, other data added to the problem of lack of water. According to the local monopoly
  <em>
   Mediamax
  </em>
  , based on 2022 census data, 27,000 indigenous people in the MS do not even have a bathroom - sometimes using only one hole in the floor or just with the toilet - and another 12,500 shared common bathrooms for various houses. Among the “critical situations” investigated by the newspaper, including the city of Tacuru, which, alongside Japorã and Paranhos, has more than 20% of the municipality's indigenous population with a lack of bathrooms. This situation of the basic sanitation of the indigenous people, however, is just another aggravating problem of the broader problem of lack of access to land. After all, Sasoró's indigenous people do not completely enjoy the hectares demarcated for them and still receive residents of other territories, such as the indigenous people who are expelled from their

  After the avoidable death of a newborn in a hospital in the municipality of Manicoré, on March 6, the people of the city Se Rebelo and attacked the house of the mayor of the city, Lúcio Flávio (PSD) and sectors of the hospital. Afraid of the mass revolt, the old state responded by sending the shock troop to identify and arrest the protesters.
 </p>
<p>
  The case began at the Dr. Hamilton Maia Cidade Regional Hospital, where on the same day, a one -day baby would have died due to medical complications. Residents and relatives of the newborn accuse, however, both medical and city neglect, who would not have been interested in providing the necessary assistance in time.
 </p>
<figure class="wp-block-video">

</video>
</figure>
<p>
  The answer of the masses, after the baby's funeral, was to summon a major demonstration that attacked part of the hospital's facilities and continued towards the mayor's own house, Lucio Flávio (PSD), who was not in residence at the time. With the help of a car, the pasta destroyed the gate and took the residence, demonstrating their fury against this injustice.
 </p>
<p>
  In response to the rebellion, the municipal government called the Military Police shock troop. In a statement, the local government stated that: “Unacceptable acts of depredation and property damage will be faced with the full force of the law. The City Hall of Manicoré ensures that those responsible for these actions will be identified and will respond to the court for their conduct. ” In another note, the city still cynically accused residents of wanting to “politicize” a tragic event.
 </p>
<p>
  The truth is that the case is not a “isolated incident” or even just a “tragic event”, but a symptom of public health destruction throughout Brazil and, in particular, in the state of Amazonas, as

  Jammed in crimes, mayor fears new rebellions
 </h4>
<p>
  The main target of the demonstration, Mayor Lúcio Flávio (PSD), also maintains an extensive condemnation racing form, where he has already been pointed out by the court as author of “voting buy” actions during the 2016 elections, as well as using funds public to hire a PM for their “private security”.
 </p>
<p>
  After the act, the politician's first action was to mobilize the city's security forces to keep his residence and, soon after, to seek a new shock troop team for the municipality. These actions demonstrate the profound dread of the reactionary in the face of a new survey of these masses, which narrowly not generalized a great revolt throughout the city.

  Can fiction be more real than reality? João Ubaldo shows us that yes. Naked and raw reality suffers from lines that tie it and give them consistency. Therefore, every vision and every portrait of reality are extremely ideological. The truth, the real, is made of ideology. All art is, therefore, as much as some seek to forget this, the result of a form of life. Every work is synthesis, frozen and alive, of concrete and contradictory individuals, about the world they live and the relationship they establish with it.
  <em>
   Long live the Brazilian people
  </em>
  , novel by João Ubaldo Ribeiro, it is quite interesting not only for its literary exceptionality, but also as an example of the contradictions that constitute a work of art.
 </p>
<p>
  Let's start with the good part. The novel addresses, under the style commonly known as fantastic realism (in which fantastic, unreal, mythological elements, etc., run side by side with reality), the history of Brazil, especially the period between independence (1822) and proclamation of the Republic (1889). We see just about everything, the gradual change of Portuguese imperialism to English, the capitalist need for the abolition of the slave system, the crisis of mills, the cultural and religious dynamics by mixing in the cultural cauldron, the emergence of an unbeaten national bourgeoisie as not Being European, the growth of cities and the sub -articization of the elite, the first struggles armed by the land, the horrors of the Paraguayan War, the conformation of the Brazilian Army and, especially, the life and struggle of the Brazilian people.
 </p>
<p>
  In this epic, it is surprised that the book has “only” 640 pages. It's just that John uses a trick, a seasoning, the "fantasy" serves as a lashing. That is, it draws apparent continuities between seemingly discontinuous events. But it's just a trick, because, in fact, these events do have a continuity, but very difficult to capture. Take the most beautiful example: almost all the fighters of the people represented in the novel have contact with a box within which one can spy "everything", all that has already been learned by past fighters. Thus, the struggles of the Brazilian people evolve from the first indigenous resistance to straws, to the communists in the Vargas era and the dictatorship of 64. Of course there is continuity between all these struggles, of course they trace a story, but one History, we can say, discontinuous, fragmented, full of roads and paths, almost irrastreable, almost countless. But through the insertion of a magical object, John "sewing" the story without false it. At this point, the use of fantasy is more real than reality, because in condensing very complex historical processes in a metaphor, it is able to enunciate a truth that would be very difficult to convey otherwise.
 </p>
<p>
  This box, however, is not limited to giving magical powers to the characters. When it is presented, we may not yet realize it, but it is the opposition that supports the whole book, a opposition to bourgeois history. Let's see: “But, the blind one explained, the story is not just the one in books, because many who write books lie more than those who tell stories of Trancoso. […] In addition, the blind man continued, the story made by papers lets all that was not made on paper and only puts himself on paper what matters. […] Someone who stole writes who stole, who killed writes who killed, who gave false testimony confess that he was a liar? Do not confess. Does anyone write well from the enemy? Do not write. So the whole story of the roles is for someone's interest. ”
 </p>
<p>
  The blind exposure - a figure that echoes the mythological seer, the one who sees otherwise - along with the presentation of the box shows us the fundamentally ideological aspect of history. Is there a better way to explain why every ideology is class ideology? Such lines echo about war and peace, when Tolstoy brilliantly points out that the intellectuals who write the books often overvalue their own deeds over the people's achievements. Let us observe this in the way we often learn history in schools: a story made only by a few great men and every now and then a Princess Isabel, erasing all the strength that the people employ to make the time compressor roll.
 </p>
<p>
  This is the thesis of the novel
  <em>
   Long live the Brazilian people
  </em>
  , recover the history of the people. But there are immense difficulties, an ideological erasure, but also one quite literal: much of the past has been lost, many files were burned, decimated populations, the huge majority of the Brazilian people were or is illiterate: it did not write its story or did not have the one write. How to rebuild a story that survives through rituals, food, garments, prayers, crafts, dictated, superstitions, scars, anything but documents? Therefore the use of fantasy is crucial to
  <em>
   Long live the Brazilian people
  </em>
  , the book would not exist otherwise, because there is a huge gap between what happened and
  <em>
   as
  </em>
  it happened. Fantasy comes to sew this gap and tell us a mythological but deeply real story that touches the struggles of our people more than any document would be capable. The box, spiritual incorporations, cannibalism, unlikely chances, mythological combatants, all resources to say what may otherwise were unquestionable.
 </p>
<p>
  Therefore, this novel is important to expand horizons for the production of truly democratic literature. We understand with John how the literary tool should be appropriate to its object and the multiplicity of possible styles derives from the infinity of available objects. We could talk about how some artistic forms are intrinsically linked to certain forms of ideology according to their material origins (the most evident example: agroning), but this is for another text, in addition, I am ready to advance that these are exceptions, after all, after all Even the police genre has been used brilliantly subverted, just read
  <em>
   The name of the Rose
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   August
  </em>
  .
 </p>
<p>
  It is just worth putting that not everything is flowers.
  <em>
   Long live the Brazilian people
  </em>
  It ends in a low grade that does not match all its energy. We advanced to a certain point for the 1970s, when Stalin José, a Brazilian communist, dies of apparent tiredness or disappointment. Soon after, we have a passage in which the continuity of the Brazilian people, hitherto sewn through fictional resources, is reduced to a specific resource: the manifestation of spirits who successively embody during generations. As if the story were just something that lives through us and of which we are not really part.
 </p>
<p>
  I don't want to tell the whole plot, so this explanation may make the book look silly. It is not. In fact, the narrative is well conducted and the closing of history follows the internal logic it has established. It took a good effort to realize, however, that the literary tool that once connected fiction to reality, only joined fiction to fiction. It should be noted, of course, that every tool is a two-edged knife. In the end, it seems that John cuts himself. After a Homeric effort to glimpse the past, it seems difficult to give the important turn to the future and resorts to an idealistic thesis of history. It is the only point that weighs negatively and significantly in the book. It is not justification not to read it. On the contrary, it may be another reason for him being so interesting.

  Residents of different slums in the Monte Cristo neighborhood closed different roads in a protest during March 9, organized after the murder, two days earlier, from a young man in the Grota favela by civil police officers of the Special Resources Coordination (Core). Residents claim that the young man was unarmed.
 </p>
<p>
  The protest concentrated residents of the Grota favelas, Chico Mendes, Sapé and other communities. Videos record huge barricades of fire on important roads in the region, such as Josué di Bernardi Avenue, Joaquim Nabuco and José Antonio Tonolli. The popular revolt in condemnation of police raids and murders in the communities began on the afternoon of 03/09 and continued until the dawn of 10/03.

 Divine indignation infiltrated the silk costumes and strangled their filthy vocal cords by the in -house and out -of -House of Livanists of a situation in the male and female exploitation. Class and not patriarchal. Covering the recent expression of "Sugar Daddies" of the Secretary -General of a rhetoric of a rhetorical and substantially valuable (for Greek things and a) reformist icon of the system.
 <br>
<br>
 Extravagant, outrageous. Mastrians are discouraged to honor virginity and morality in the beginning of the Capitalism of Capitalism!
 <span>
<a name="more">

</span>
<br>
 End of provocative as well. There is no accusation and no accusation is allowed when there is a terrible phenomenon. On the contrary, its revelation is to be stoned. That is, something as a reward for ostriches, sanctification of voluntary and embellishment of exhaustion. The capture of the oligarchs costume is intelligent. We remove something unpleasant, as long as we don't mention it !! So it is important for the outside good testimony (out of the doll) and not at all in the inner atoms (plague).
 <br>
<br/>
 Unless those who recognize the timeless existence of prostitution (caring) within this driving force of profit and therefore commercialized society, live in a parallel universe. They narrate myths of a virtual reality of a false merciful and cross the angelically fired world of capitalist power.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But, because of the relics and grounding with the surroundings, this ancient (same chronology as the appearance of inequality) needed at least a small portion of the female (and less male) poverty to be issued flesh for a living? Therefore, this behavior is slanderous and criticized. Naive question. Unless all the houses of tolerance disappear as magic (identical to the perpetuation-decorating of a good-natured material way of production). Of course, all their formal and non -formal forms. At the living classical level of physical mumble, up to modern telephone, online and cinematic. From the "gentle" version of "voluntary" bump (paid and "consensual" rape), we were the last barbaric of sexual rape.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Fantasy Product the three -year -old circuit incident in Cologne with a twelve -year -old victim and perpetrator - under an orchestrated attempt at acquittal - neo -democratic executive? Like the countless police officers, who, when they do not open with student heads or do not shoot at the Roma ps, are engaged in the lucrative role of hard promotions (nineteen years in Ilioupoli, foreigners from Cameroon, Romania, etc.). In order not to expand to the dark interplay of state mechanisms with the underworld of the underworld and the organized crime. In Chania, the two priests who have repeatedly raped (otherwise the "Christian" priesthood crushes against gay marriage) with a mental retardation of a minor, are now compensated for their "unfair" time of detention!
 <br/>
<br/>
 Certainly- and unfortunately- some needy students will become erotic objects to secure tuition fees (one of the main aspirations of the Public Horse Rapid) at public universities. This is already the case on a limited scale and which will be expanded self -evolved after a sharp increase in study costs. Unless the student struggle overturns the law.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But of course the forces and executives and people are annoyed by the projection of aspects of their choleli Truth. Even when such a nays are unleashed by its representative from the left -wing breakwater of the resentment of the majority and a seemingly opponent. From the step of the Metropolitan Temple of their Iron Republic where the colossal lie is praised. That is to say, through his processes the people interfere with their fate.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Formulations of such style in times of attempted strangulation and criminalization of any ideological and practical challenge of the strategic directions of the system are undesirable, unacceptable. Their papal appearances are capable of microscopic differences from the opposition (for the proper functioning of the alternation of managers), while their rational, ethnocentrial policy will be applied by antenna. For any heretical derogation there is mockery, threats, persecution and prison railings. Macronisia and executions, at present are considered untimely.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The secretary swallowed his tongue with the ubiquitous firing of fire, which he received and almost apologetically blended by the seats of Parliament photographic evidence of his claim. After all, he was unable to repel the prime minister's anti -communist bile for the wide known extent of prostitution in the socialist camp. When, until the last moment of its collapse and the formal return to pure -blooded capitalism, its entirely awareness was praised by its disgust for decades before glooming derailment from the course of socialist construction. With a fatal consistency of all the inherent in the surface of the rotten system. It would be funny and contradiction, if he was in the wake, that the crash, a lawful system he praised, presented exactly all the common, shameless features with his authentic Mitsotakis.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The rulers hate the truth by abusing the brutal. They are struggling to persuade that the policy of misery works for the good of our common national economy. How the future is erased auspicious. Private Higher Institutions will broaden the possibility of study. Establishing afternoon surgery improves care conditions. The disasters of water and fires are responsible for the vengeance of nature. Guilty to the mass crime in Tempi is raised by every random driver. Small nationalism -enormously defends the interests of the tribe and the drag in the full of diligence -the warrior war adventures of the western killers on the planet serves the security of the area!
 <br/>
<br/>
 They were justifiably outraged by references to prostitution. Alas and crushed the sophisticated outer shell of cheating masses. They will be irreparably exposed and only the repressive and military armor will be left. Like slugs, they will hardly hide the disgusting aspect of themselves. Being a deep and widespread homeland, they ravaged it productively, so that the multinationals and stallions of mankind could benefit. Making it a five -star maid. They were degrading her dowries. They 'issue' on the sidewalks of sucking the labor force under the most impulsive terms. They are played for the conversion of every territory of territories into US -eating imperialism and at the same time Russia's nuclear targets. Without the slightest hesitation, the local dreamers are campaigning with their most selective iron, collaborating with Zionism - imperialism in the hell of the slaughter of the Palestinian people and the brutal attempt to crush their resistance.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Mitsotakis was angry with the semificant (and "uninformed" on him) in the hearing of the pupils. It is so cut for them that it erects inaccessible obstacles to their requirement to study. But myopic are his reflexes, as well as any other aspiring commander of the bourgeois state. As it begs the bosses the provision of compensatory benefits for the presence of bases. Promoting military tourism and promising the recreation (relief of sexual impulses) of the mercenary crews from the murderous hectics, often docked in Souda. No disruption was caused by the slide of his birthplace, which faithfully walks in the footsteps of the old infamous trumpet and endless borderell. According to his reasoning, it is not that it is negative, but when it is obviously named.
 <br/>
<br/>
 There was no reckless of the cruel attack by the boss of the plutocracy against the leader of the party, which is captured by symbols, ideally the revolutionary traditions of the Left. So why so much in spite of the fresh, useful services of undermining rural and student uprising?
 <br/>
<br/>
 After the first winning chapter and the staff of the round of the match against the popular forces, their registration remains. Especially from the unpredictable impulsivity of student youth. Certainly after sealing the successes will be followed by the next sweeping raid. It will be attempted to drain anything left of the old conquests and separates the dignity of the man's man from a collapsed sub -hall with zero rights in bread, studies, health care, pension and peace. They envision the end of their anti -popular campaign, probably when they manage to cross the feet of the proletarians and scratch the slave's body with the whip.
 <br/>
<br/>
 So in order to achieve these critical goals, any perception of resistance to anti -populist storms in time must be tackled. Even if it is pronounced by formations, which acts hypocritically, but on the practitioner they are mines.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Terrorism and submission messages are sent in all directions and in all tones. The correctness of their view is redeemed. With fire and iron, their designs will be implemented.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Do you hear what the muds are spread there? Prostitution; Disappeared. Working classroom? Bless you the employer that feeds you. Hunger and deprivation? Zero and decreasing. Accuracy; International issue. Unemployment; Alchemy of statistics shrinks it. Murders in the caterpillars? Carelessness of workers. Deliro repressive? Exclusively for the margin that crosses the serenity of the whole. Raise peasantry? Measures to adapt to new data. Studies, care? You pay, you have them. Nightmares of war risks? Integrated into the "right side of the story" to sleep long. At least as carefree they rest in Palestinian blood lakes, Syrians, Libyans, Iraqis, Ukrainians.
 <br/>
<br/>
 When blatantly, sometimes screaming and as the language does not care, then with the persuasion of the bourgeois, they handle the enemy people. They have deafening speakers to disseminate their voice. They manage to cover his secluded, daily groaning of the carpenter and his anathema against them.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But when they are transformed into slogans of protest and claim and join the streets of the struggles in mass, dynamic, organized, incompatible at once, the voice of the tyrants becomes a whisper, which erases in front of the people of the people.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In this field, it stands out which - distinctly size - political power is dedicated to the popular affair. The Hera who launches the ungodly complaints and directs symbolic mobilizations along with the paralyzing gases of these - Messianic elections? Or the wheat that is constantly pushing the critical necessity to flood the roads of the struggles as the only way out of the Zofo, which spreads by the state of capital and imperialists?

    About 800 families organized by the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST) occupied a large estate in Minas Gerais and land associated with the São Francisco and Parnaíba Valleys Company (Codevasf) in Bahia, on March 8 and 10. In pronouncements, the peasants criticized the government for not delivering land to the peasants. This is the first land occupation of the MST in 2024, and occurs after a year of 2023 marked by the discrepancy between complete paralysis in the purchase of land for land reform and large investments in the government's landlord.

    The land occupied in Minas Gerais is located in Lagoa Santa, metropolitan region of Belo Horizonte. The 500 families who occupied the landowner state that the farm was abandoned by the owners and was unproductive.

<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
    According to a state leadership, the occupation was a response to the slowness of the government to meet the peasants' demands and occurred as "the most legitimate alternative to fight for the right to land."

     The Lula government did not buy any land for land reform
    </a>
    despite the government's promises to set up a “land shelf”. The central justification for the lack of land delivery was the “lack of budget”, but many peasants question the explanation against the destination of values that exceed R $ 300 billion to agribusiness through low interest credits.

    A request for repossession was fired in court, but denied by the judicial body. About the request, the MST stated that "they could not demonstrate that they have land possession and failed to prove the productivity of the farm, which has been abandoned for almost a decade."
   </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
    In Bahia, the peasants made similar requirements. There, there were about 300 families who occupied an area of Codevasf on March 10th. The peasants denounced both the lack of land and the lack of water in the region, and blamed Codevasf for the situation of precariousness.

    Codevasf said the available water is offered to farmers regularly registered in the venture.

    Throughout 2023, Luiz Inácio's team insisted on the impossibility of carrying out land reform with the low value left by Bolsonaro's budget. However, there was no significant difference in the budget for the Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform from 2023 to 2024: while in the budget left by Bolsonaro the total figure of the institute was R $ 2.85 billion, the one set up by Lula dedicated R $ 2 , 89 billion to the agency. According to calculations by groups such as the National Confederation of Agriculture Workers (Contag), the increase of $ 400 million is far from enough. For Contag, an effective land reform policy would require at least $ 7 billion.

    With such miserable elevations, it is expected that the results for 2024 do not differ much from 2023. Last year had the smallest number of settlers in all petist governments.

   Plusted before the Armed Forces Generals, President Luiz Inacio gave a direction directed to all his ministries: to paralyze any and all initiative that deals with the Military-Deputy Coup of April 1, 1964, which this year will turn 60. Official acts, solemnities, mentions of speeches by government members, publication of materials or inauguration of Mark in memory of the crimes and violations of rights that the reactionary military committed in the 21 years of the regime - everything is suspended by express orders from Lula.
  </span>
</p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  Last Thursday, March 7, President Luiz Inacio met with Silvio Almeida, human rights minister, a folder that had (until then) an extensive program on the subject. The information is from Correio Braziliense.
 </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  Nor should the creation of a memory and truth museum be effective. While still at the head of the Ministry of Justice, Flávio Dino announced the initiative during an event in Chile in repudiation at the 50th anniversary of the Pinochet coup.
 </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  Luiz Inacio's order is to offer an agreement with the generals who, in return, would no longer publish their “order of day” on March 31. Year after year, Armed Forces Commanders celebrate the date through the "Order," which is read in all the country's barracks.
 </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  The Federal Government had already disadvitered the recreation of the committee of politicians. And on February 27, Luiz Inácio, during an interview, said that one should not "break the story." The statement was defended by Hamilton Mourão.
 </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  It will be up to the true democrats, popular organizations and struggle movements of the Brazilian people the fundamental task of denouncing yesterday and today's coup of the military regime.
 </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  The newspaper
  <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">
   The New Democracy
  </span>
  will organize a political act on April 25 under the motto
  <span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">
   Neither forget nor appease: condemn the blow yesterday and today!

 </p>
<p style='background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: "roboto serif", sans-serif; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 24px; text-align: justify;'>
  “It is urgent that progressives, genuine and revolutionary democrats undertake serious combat of coup, condemning the 60 years of the 1964 military coup and coup today. As part of combating the policy of appeasement (only one way of cowing), we demand that the Special Commission on the Dead and Missing Politicals by the shift government is reinstalled, as it is a demand from family members and of unique importance to bring to the national political debate the fascist horrors of the military regime. It is necessary to defend democratic freedoms, already so much and under permanent attacks, through urgent mobilization. ”

<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   On the eve of the Council Chamber at the Court of L'Aquila 
 On the extradition in Israel of the Palestinian political refugee 
 Anan Yaesh, and while mounting mobilization throughout the national territory for its liberation and against its extradition, 2 other Palestinian refugees were arrested this morning by Digos at the request of the Public Prosecutor of L'Aquila, 
 District Anti -Mafia and Anti -terrorism Directorate, in coordination with the National Prosecutor.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   According to the accusation 
 An operational structure called “Group would have been established 
 quick response - Brigades Tulkarem ”, filiation would seem 
 of the brigades of the martyrs of Al-Aqsa, which has among its objectives 
 acts of violence against the state of Israel. The brigades to the AQSA, 
 relating to Al Fatah, at the request of Israel have been inserted 
 from the European Union in the black list of organizations 
 terrorist.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   For all three arrested 
 An extradition procedure has been activated on stress 
 of the Israeli authorities.
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   The accusations against Anan were obviously not effective enough to quickly obtain the extraction, as is also deduced from the intervention of his lawyer yesterday during the garrison at the Terni prison, where he relaunched, in addition to that of 12 tomorrow in L'Aquila, Also another important date for national mobilization, that of March 20 in Rome at the Court of Cassation
  </span>

</span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
   The timing, to say the least suspect, between the hearing and these new arrests push us to relaunch the mobilization more forcefully. Below is the appeal of the Aquila coordination for Palestine:
  </span>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
<br>
</br></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
    No to the entication for Anan and to the torture of the Palestinians, the eagle calls to mobilization
   </span>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
    The Aquila coordination for Palestine tomorrow in garrison to 
 Court for the hearing on the release of Anan Yaeesh
   </span>
</i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm;">
<span style="font-family: verdana;">
<br>
   With 
 A perfect timing, a few hours after the hearing to the Court of Appeal 
 of the L'Aquila in which the request for release of 
 Anan Yaeesh, three other arrest mandates were carried out in the 
 Night at L'Aquila. One of the three concerns Anan himself. Particular 
 that a arrest warrant is issued the day before in which it comes 
 The request for release is discussed.
   <br>
<br/>
   The accusations are of 
 International terrorism and subversion. The media, bringing back so 
 Certosino what has been suggested by the Police Headquarters, they even refer 
 the preparation of suicidal attacks. Meanwhile, in this 
 context, and with these heavy accusations, people arrested again 
 they do not have access to their file, nor do they know anything, except that they are 
 Be took from home to dawn and transferred to prison. 
 Exactly as it happened in Anan in late January.
   <br/>
<br/>
   There 
 In short, we would amaze if the accusations proved unfounded, 
 Considering Italian collaborationism with a correspondence status 
 Like Israel. It is clear that in the ethnic cleaning project 
 perpetrated by the Jewish state also enters the elimination of 
 Palestinian people who live abroad, often by virtue 
 of the political persecution to which they were subjected to the territories 
 illegally occupied. In our city and in our country there is a 
 very heavy climate against dissent, against those who try to oppose a 
 a genocide that is underway thanks also to the complicity 
 of Italy. Against those who dare questioning a meaning 
 Unique and totalizing.
   <br/>
<br/>
   For this it is important to raise the 
 voice against the request for extradition from those who constantly violate e 
 For decades human rights and international law has killed 
 30 thousand people in 4 months, forces a apartheid, deport one whole 
 Population and torture the prisoners, even minors.
   <br/>
<br/>
   For 
 This we reiterate how much more important it is to be present at 
 Presidium of tomorrow 12 March, at 11, at the Court of via XX 
 September in L'Aquila. We invite the population of L'Aquila and the 
 country to mobilization.

  Mauro Cid's new testimony, a former Bolsonaro-joint, should not bring anything that completely modifies the course of events. As it cannot lie or omit in the face of questions - since it is an official whistleblower - and may lose the benefits of
  <em>
   caring
  </em>
  Awarded, it is certain that Cid will produce new frictions in the military crisis, more clearly revealing the role of certain characters. One of them is former Defense Minister Paulo Sérgio Nogueira.
 </p>
<p>
  So far, Paulo Sérgio-who is also former army commander-has been spared, according to Bolsonaro's own allies. However, it is a fact that he was on the front line of several initiatives to accident the country's institutional land in 2022, and, for example, responsible for making the “report” of the Armed Forces about such reliability of the electronic ballot boxes, in which, in which, Although there was no evidence collected from fraud, he manifested ambiguously as he burst-armed actions in the interior of the country calling for military intervention. At a meeting, this same general was caught referring to his participation in the Electoral Transparency Commission as an operation “in the lines of contact with the enemy”. Innocence is not the case of this general.
 </p>
<p>
  Although not the most likely, it is also possible that something else is said about the then Army Commander, General Freire Gomes. He, who presents himself as the "Santinho" of the Republic, for refusing "boarding" in the coup in "time H", is not immaculate. In December 2022, for example, former pocketmaker Ailton Barros exchanged the following messages with Mauro Cid: “There was
  <em>
   change in the wind
  </em>
  ? FG [Freire Gomes]
  <em>
   it returned
  </em>
  denying the door? ”, To which Cid replied,“
  <em>
   It returned
  </em>
  … ”And Ailton replied:“ FDP ”. As it turns out, Freire Gomes was not the example of Democrat, but until the last moment he flirted, was permissive and waited until the last moment for the "stop" if he decided and he made his decision; arrived at
  <em>
   to change
  </em>
  of opinion, generating anger in the core core pockets. Perhaps that is why he kept the scammers, issued "notes" greeting the camps of "green chickens" such as "democratic" and other maneuvers more, until the last day of Bolsonaro's term. Maybe that's why it was called
  <em>
   shit
  </em>
  by Braga Neto.
 </p>
<p>
  Finally, ICD will probably be asked about the exchange of messages with the Major of the Special Forces, Rafael Martins de Oliveira, in which both make transactions of values to fund “Protesters Expenses” in Brasilia. Everything points to the proof of the thesis, long raised by this podium, that those manifestations of green chickens, both in Brasilia and in the rest of the country, had an operational core of professional people, functioning as an extreme political party right and with military capacity. These people, in whom they have lost the initiative and passed on to the defensive tactical, did not disappear: follows with their opinions, mirroring and waiting for the first opportunity to put yourself again in the offensive. And there is no conciliation that can sweep this scammer threat from the map.

   Indeed, following the dismissal by Grand Lyon Habitat of this former guardian of the building in early January, the discontent won the inhabitants knowing him, and solidarity was built very largely, until the holding of a rally on Wednesday March 6.
  </p>
<p>
   Let's go back to the story around this dismissal: last November, the goalkeeper was awakened one morning at 7 a.m. by several police officers who are drumming at his door. In question, a vast police descent in the United States district. Police forces then ask him for the keys to the cellars. The goalkeeper then came across 4 young people, handcuffed and kneeling, and, abused, under pressure and completely destabilized he replied that he did not have them.
  </p>
<p>
   Upon the arrival of the agency director more than an hour later, the latter also attacks the goalkeeper, who gave him the keys explaining to him that he had found them after the request of the police officers, that he does not want to hinder the police but that in the midst of the operation he preferred to wait for his superior.
  </p>
<p>
   The continuation is funny or terrifying, as desired: the 4 young people are released for lack of evidence, the garages forced by the locksmith prove to be empty, and the exploration of the cellars offers absolutely no element for the investigation.
  </p>
<p>
   Neither the police nor justice then criticizes the former Garden for having hampered the investigation, but Grand Lyon Habitat Si, and the agency director begins disciplinary procedure with regard to his employee for fault serious, hinders the work of the police, and an attitude which would have been disrespectful and close to the insubordination in front of his superior.
  </p>
<p>
   While his work is recognized and praised by his colleagues and the inhabitants, the proof is with the wave of solidarity which swept, Rachid is finally dismissed in January, after several months of procedure, not receiving after more than 30 years of work at GLH that a little more than 2000 € and having to make its official accommodation.
  </p>
<p>
   Indeed, its official housing is handed over to the private housing market, which implies that the next building goalkeeper, who will potentially be an employee in subcontracting, will have no function housing. The lessor would thus kill two strokes with one stone, recovering more accommodation to add to his housing stock, and getting rid of the management of employees who would be delegated to an intermediary.
  </p>
<p>
   Faced with this new demonstration of the unworthy methods and thugs of Grand Lyon Habitat, the CPES and Rachid decide to organize a rally in front of his home, a hundred meters from the United States agency of the lessor.

<p>
   About 60 people therefore found themselves during the gathering to listen to the various speeches, sign the support petition or discuss the continuation to give this mobilization.
  </p>
<p>
   It was first Rachid who thanked the people who came to support him at length, supporting the fact that collective mobilization is the strength of "small against large".
  </p>
<p>
   A spokesperson for the CPES then supported this declaration, calling for continuing the fight, and insisting that the committee would continue to fight alongside Rachid and all the inhabitants abused by the lessor Voyou Glh.
  </p>
<p>
   "We take this opportunity to inform you that a legal proceedings of formal notice is currently underway to require control of these charges coming to couple all our popular mobilizations, and we also affirm that we will support Rachid as much as it is necessary Until he obtains compensation,
   <strong>
    Because whether Rachid or the charges, we are faced with the same problem: residents of despised working-class neighborhoods, as are workers in factories or women relegated to secondary and underpaid jobs. ”
   </strong>

<p>
   We were also able to question Coralia, member of the CPES, on the consequences of this mobilization:
  </p>
<p>
   New era (ne): Hello, thank you for answering our questions. First of all, how did you know this case?
   <br>
   Coralia: So we got to know this case because Rachid contacted the CPES. Indeed, he had already seen our work in the neighborhood, it was one of his neighbors who provided him with our contact.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Ne: Now that this gathering is made, what do you prepare to continue the fight against this injustice?
   <br>
   Coralia: What came out of this gathering is that everyone wants to go further, gathering in front of the antenna of the United States of Grand Lyon Habitat to affirm their dissatisfaction with this injustice. We will continue to broadcast this case in the neighborhood so that the tenants are aware that GLH despises them but also despises its employees.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Ne: You are talking about the contempt of Greater Lyon Habitat against his tenants, this takes us on the question of your fight against abusive charges, can you tell us where the situation is?
   <br>
   Coralia: We have started first legal proceedings for formal notice through a lawyer in order to obtain a check of the charges. We are not fooled, we are aware that it is not only by the judicial route that we will achieve our ends, but it is a tool to show once again than together we are strong, and in order to Unmask the mafia schemes of Grand Lyon Habitat.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Ne: Finally, last question: what do you want to say to all those who are in the same situation, who are crushed by thugs or dishonest bosses and who undergo injustices?
   <br>
   Coralia: I take a sentence from Rachid, we will "show the big ones that the little ones when they are all together, they are strong". This is the goal of the CPES, to recreate solidarity in the neighborhood to be able to fight, to be aware that collectively we are a force and to win victories and no longer let it go.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Don't you: would you like to add something?
   <br>
   Coralia: As everyone in the neighborhood has understood, the situation of Rachid is neither trivial nor isolated, it reminds us of the difficulties that everyone faces, and today we must fight together to do justice To the people who will no longer let themselves be done, for all those who have been crushed and could not make the blows.
  </br></p>
<p>
   Ne: Thank you, and see you very soon!
   <br>
   Coralia: Thanks to you, good evening.

    This year there was a rally on Mariahilferstrasse on March 8, organized by the Women's Center Vienna (FZ), the Red Women's Committee Vienna and the Frauenhetz. Around 100 people gathered, speeches were made and songs were presented. The speeches dealt with current topics and how these women affect in particular. A large part of the women works in those sectors that receive lower wages and around half of them part -time. This made them particularly hard by the inflations of the past few years, as well as the wage cuts as a result of poor KV degrees. In this context, the increase in the age of pension from women was also criticized. This increase was planned in the 1990s and should be introduced

    The speakers of the rally also opposed the increasing militarization and upgrade and explained the need to organize themselves for the struggle. In addition, important revolutionary movements in the world - such as in India, Peru, Turkey and on the Philippines - were held up and emphasized that numerous women are at the forefront in fights like this. The speakers also criticized the introduction of the parent-child passport, since its defective data protection enables social security to read, among other things, the number of abortions from a woman.

    The demonstration on March 8, the International Frauenkampftag, was organized together this year in Linz from the "Alliance March 8" and "DIY" ("Do It Yourself: Frauensag"). The demo train of around 2,500 demonstrators started at the music theater/Volksgarten and moved across the country road to Hauptplatz. The red flag was also represented with an information table for acquiring the newspaper and accompanied the demonstration.

    Although numerous party -related clubs tried to prevent a combative expression on the demonstration, there were some participants the democratic and revolutionary demands powerfully and combative with their slogans in the demo train. Among other things, the demands for more childcare places and against the closure of women's protection facilities were heard here. Furthermore, higher wages, an increase in unemployment benefit to 80 percent and the need for a revolutionary women's movement content of the slogans were distributed.

    Some participants rightly criticized the fact that some parts of the demonstration were more of a "party mood" than a combative attitude spread. This in turn shows the need for a revolutionary women's movement and the struggle and merger for it!

 The clouds of war are darkening our days and our system policies are immersed in poverty. The objective reality we are experiencing is so gloomy that it requires that subjective weaknesses and suspensions created by the adverse correlation of power to the detriment of the peoples to change the Rous of History and not to lead humanity to the devastation that is pushed by bourgeoisie. . The forces struggling to overthrow the unequal and unjust class social system cannot bypass the female issue. There can be no massive moves seriously in questioning, let alone the overthrow of capitalism, without the involvement of women in the struggle, without giving the prospect of a solution to the woman's inequality. There can be no reason, not only for socialism, but also for complete and stable democracy, without the attraction of women, that is, without half of the human population, in politics and the struggle, as Lenin used to say. He always emphasized that there is no social equality without a solution to female inequality.
 <br>
<br>
 In recent years it has been rich in unpleasant news and tragic events with victims of women. The rape and murders of women have become a daily routine. Sexual scandals in the field of art and sport involving people above criticism. The way they are treated or explained shows that nothing is self -evident or commonly accepted around the case of female liberation. On the one hand they throw responsibilities on the male sex and on the other to the female. Increasingly, the voices that justify the murderers and the victims exaggerate. The system is fascist and with affection the most reactive there is, justifies and gives it a step. Women's conquests at work and insurance have been abolished and her basic rights are threatened and disputed in various ways, such as the right to abortion. The pandemic of Coronovirus, which has caused great social and economic upheavals, the attack on the income and rights of the workers and the people, as well as the systematic effort to control and suppress youth, exacerbate its problems and multiply the crimes of all kinds at the expense of it. The EU has set up a series of programs, institutions and observatories, in the name of gender equality, so that it can pass its anti -populist policies through this path and impose cuts of rights, such as layoffs of pregnant women. The US and the EU imperialists, to control peoples, penetrate every human activity, exploit every need and use the woman as bait and victim. This side of imperialism is exported to it countries either as an ideological and cultural product or as a direct exploitation of their inhabitants…
 <br/>
<br/>
 The retreat of revolutionary and communist ideas and the defeat of the labor movement has dragged its defeat and its female part. A number of false perceptions such as: "The female movement is not needed because it is covered by the labor", "all the classics" were developed, "the woman's integration into the movement will solve the problems with the other sex on its own. "," All the issues of the woman will be resolved by the revolution "and others. Today, the bourgeois ideology that feeds feminism is dominated, which is trying to lead any women's movement appears in the spotlight. Although it fails, despite his clear support from the propaganda urban systems, to move the popular female population, which remains dumb and decommissioned, confuses the youth and seduces several pieces of the left, who do not see or do not see that they do not see that they do not see that Its modernity lies all the rotten bourgeoisie.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Nowadays there is nothing self -evident. There is a need to clarify the elementary ones, such as what the female issue is, how it appeared and above all what are the characteristics of today. Because the female issue didn't always exist. The story of the woman may be the story of her oppression but she was not conscious of her condition. She also believed that her lower position in society was a will of God, that her destination was to serve others. As long as the woman's life was limited in the family home, her enslavement within the family could, at best, cause humanitarian sympathy and various reasoning for the means that would relieve the fate of the humiliated, within the exploitative society. , female sex.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The appearance and development of the female issue is an important development of the capitalist period. There are two reasons for it. The former has to do with the phase that the bourgeoisie when claimed power and came out with slogans trying to support all the oppressed groups, the poor masses of the proletariat and of course women. The second is related to the massive entry of the woman to work in capitalist businesses. To meet the need for capital in cheap labor hands, he brought the woman to the factories, as did the children. The rights raised by the bourgeoisie during its revolutionary phase became a salaried slavery, and the liberation that promised the enlightenment theorists promised to the woman's theorists became a double harsh oppression, at home and at work. But the entry to work, the fact that she was coming out of her home, made the female worker realize her miserable position and claim human life and rights.
 <br/>
<br/>
 At that time, all members of a working family were converted into wage slaves. A young couple, in the 19th century, by moving them from a rural to an urban area, reduced their life expectancy by a decade. The conditions of her work and life are miserable, so she has to fight from a very early age. The first recorded female strike, with demands for better salary and working conditions, took place in the English city of Worster in 1804 by the workers of a factory that made gloves. As Kolondai says, "the female movement was only a result of women's integration into production".
 <br/>
<br/>
 Then, in addition to improving life conditions, the worker could not imagine that he could claim full rights with the man. Indeed, the workers' unions refused to write members of the workers. Since the mid -19th century, Marx and Engels meet with the movement of the workers who are taking his first steps, which they have gained with their ideas. They showed the way the woman had to take to improve her life until her full emancipation. They emphasized that no discussion could be made for female liberation without its financial independence. But as working on capitalism does not liberate anyone, nor the man, but on the contrary it is the basis of the alienation of the worker, so women's work in capitalism reproduces and perpetuates the inequality of the sexes. Maternity, for example, in capitalism can only "work" on the condition that the woman is excluded from work because motherhood is her primary role.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In the 19th century and early 20th century, the working woman was the worker, the woman, the poor woman. The women of the bourgeoisie and any mediums that existed at that time, as a rule did not work. The work of the worker was complementary to the man. The request was then for the woman to come out in production. Today, the landscape has changed. Women generally work. Women of all social classes and strata work. So we are not only talking about workers but workers today, which are obviously not included. In our country is dominated by de -industrialization, the destruction of the primary sector and the development of public and private services while the crisis is constantly closing in business. The bourgeoisie of the country is in search of a productive model. At present, statistics records that the woman has a high level of education and works in the services. Endless hours of work, precision, low wages, characterize work in our country and first affect women. The type of work, salary and working conditions have an impact on all aspects of a woman's life, inside and outside the house.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The woman is now an integral part of the workforce, and at the beginning of the 20th century she claimed the right to work. New forms of exploitation of the woman has invented the system. Her body, her femininity, maternity and other characteristics of the sex and the roles she is called upon to play, are either converted into commodities or press on them to sell goods.
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>
  FAMILY
 </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 For years, what dominated Greek society and educated the youth was the slogan "Father-Religion-Family". In a time, like the one we live in, everything collapses, the family seems to have remained unique. It has been spilled a lot of ink to prove that the institution of the family, despite the crisis that is going through, supports its members in difficult times, so we do not see hordes of homeless and destitute. Young people and young people, in the face of financial difficulties, continue to stay with their family. Today a man, if needed help, can only rely on himself or turn to his family. How do some people dare and say it should be dissolved? The family is still the whole world. Today, how to argue for its abolition without stoning? "Abolish the family! Even the most radicals are indignant about this shameful intention of the Communists, "Marx and Engels wrote in the Communist Manifesto 177 years ago. And yet the goal remains.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The bourgeois family reflects all the contradictions and contradictions of the social system and influence its members and their relationships. Of course, if the members are bourgeois or workers, it changes certain things, but it does not change its function. A family of workers is also an urban family, where the woman depends on her husband and child on his parents. It reproduces standards and urban ideology and educates with these members. He teaches what he is.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The woman is oppressed through the roles she is called upon to play and oppress herself. Capitalism removed any work that covered the needs of the family (manufacture of clothes, food production) and left it with the "uninvited" homework that never ends, so tired and resent. She is the daily night of her life. Whatever the laws and papers, analyzes, statistics and theories say, the woman is still the slave of the house. The exceptions prove the rule. Socialist construction has tried to solve the problem with the socialization of domestic work.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Today, within feminism there is a theory that home work is the key to the production of labor force. Housewives are considered part of a global class of unpaid workers, the exploitation of which is central to the accumulation of capital. They do not consider homework as unhappy, but the basis of the capitalist organization of labor. Housewives should not be related to the workers in the factories, but they can be organized worldwide, starting to control the reproduction of the labor force. Because, as men say, they control the work today, the time and the movement of their women, through family salary, women must first fight within their own families and relationships. This theory results in the request for salary to housewives and the feminist strike. According to the "99%feminist manifesto" "the production of people and the special care for their growth and prosperity are acting as a prerequisite for capitalism" so we all invite us to abstain from sex, to abstain from sex. Do not smile and not show tenderness to the faces of our family.
 <br/>

<br/>
  WOMEN'S MOVEMENT
  <br/>
</b>
<br/>
 When in 1917 the Bolsheviks took power, granted, with the first decrees, full political rights to women, the political marriage and divorce was established, prostitution was banned, homosexuality was decriminalized, abortions were allowed, abortions were abolished, It was banned from the night shift in pregnant women, etc. For their time it was unprecedented. Today all this is data. There is an equilibrium, institutionalized "equal remuneration for equal work" and numerous instructions, actions and programs of the EU ensure the elimination of all kinds of discrimination and violence against women. One would say that there are no demands for women to claim today. Of course, a series of women's conquests are lost in the context of the overall attack that the system has launched to workers and the people and they will have to win them again. One could argue that you do not need a particular formation of a female movement.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In fact, what they have given under pressure from the movements of a previous period is what capitalism could give. Double oppression at work and at home remains. Because the oppression of women does not start with the existence or not of some rights. Its roots are in class society, but each season takes other forms. That is why it is important to study the causes, forms and the consequences of female oppression today. Bebel said that "women cannot have illusions that men will help them get out of this situation, in the same way that workers have nothing to hope for the bourgeoisie." Addressing the workers, Lenin invited them to be activated, because their release from double oppression is, first of all, their own affair.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The female movement must be rebuilt as a distinct part of the labor -popular movement, and therefore much of the process is identified with the course of reconstruction of the labor -popular movement. But female has particularities and additional difficulties. He has to defend his existence, even within the female masses, to clarify his characteristics, study his story, criticize and criticize, to argue with feminism and bourgeoisie, to be tested in battles for her rights. Woman, to support her daily struggle and her confrontation with the other sex, on the basis of her opposition to the man is an expression of class contradictions, to develop arguments against the rotten dominant ideology and to reveal the multi -faceted network of control and exploitation. . This process cannot be academic. It must be alive, organized, with action and involvement of the woman of the popular strata. In this process, the woman will shake off her dominant perception of herself, which means being reinstated for the so -called "values" that are attributed to woman's relationships with society, with family, with men, with the Its function as a spouse and mother, as well as as a worker.
 <br/>
<br/>
<b>
  The anti -communist propaganda
 </b>
<br/>
<br/>
 It is obvious that the female issue and the rights of LGBTKI are used as tools to deconstruct Marxism and degrade socialism. Everyone, almost without exceptions, theorists of every trend in feminist currents are against Marx and Engels. The cursor that got up has not yet gotten up when the government has tabled the marriage of homosexual couples, which is now law. The KKE's stance has given the government's right and conservative elements, and not only, to appear as progressively and talking about the conservatism of the Left. They do everything they can to exterminate the ghost of communism that haunts them.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Today, the EFSYN newspaper is entitled "Homosexuality in the Soviet Union". It reproduces a series of Trotskyist positions that distort and slander the colossal efforts of the Bolsheviks, but especially of the Russian people, to build a new society. Trotskyism has a political form that repeats it monotonously on any subject. He praises the October Revolution, presents Trotsky as Lenin's right hand, which the two built all the good, until Stalin came, who, due to his malice and ambition to climb power, murdered and terrorized. This Trotskyist narrative has many times exploited the system to support its anti -communist propaganda. So, in 1917, the Bolsheviks decriminized homosexuality, but Stalin, in 1934, found the opportunity to invite it and began pursuing homosexuals.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Before we say about this one, we will generally say that there were problems when building socialism in the SE. And we need to recognize them and explain their causes, to draw conclusions that will help us in our struggle today. It is important on which side is criticized and why it is done. The same criticism has another function when the opponent does. After all, inside the SE The different positions on a number of issues were openly expressed. For example, the different approaches between Kolodai, Kroupskaya and Chetkin for the upbringing of children was openly expressed. Kolontai believed that the child should belong to the socialist state, Chetkin, parents and Kroupskaya, to themselves. The Chinese approached the issues of marriage, sexuality and economics, etc. We have also criticized us on aspects of the 1934 Constitution. The Chinese until 1956 criticized, but after the 20th Congress passed into the confrontation.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Indeed, in 1934, criminal punishment was decided for pedophilia and sodomism and in 1936 free abortions were banned. The reasons that led to these decisions, according to the Soviet leadership, were, for the first, the many cases of pedophilia and rape, and for the second, the huge increase in abortions. This resulted in a significant decline in births. Many men left the woman when she became pregnant, and that was another reason. Kolodai, who participated, both in the drafting of the first laws ('17 -'20) and 1936, in an interview on 17/7/1936, explains the reasons for these changes. Interesting is the point where he speaks of the need for men responsible. Characteristically, he says that "men try to avoid fulfilling their obligations. In many cases, it was especially the man who pressured the woman to have an abortion so that she would not be forced to pay for a diet. " That is why, in the debate that preceded the law passing the workplaces, women were in the majority of it, while men were more hesitant. He also explains that free abortions were allowed in the early years of the revolution, not for reasons of principle but because the conditions did not allow the young Soviet state to truly protect the mother and child. For these reasons, women's arguments are not weakened in capitalism that claim free abortions. It should be noted that there were no contraception measures at that time. Zhenotdel (Bolshevik Women's Department) had suggested in 1920 as a "temporary measure" free abortions. In general, what characterized all the laws of the Soviet state was that motherhood is a social affair and not individual.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Today we see that the solutions or "solutions" given then were the estimate that existed since 1933 that war was coming. Then it was decided to the Anti -Fascist Front and open to the Church. They were weighed in the decisions. With a distance from things today, with the knowledge of the events that followed, with the experience of the movement of a century after the conclusions of the Cultural Revolution, we can say that social issues are not resolved by administrative decisions and bans, the openings must be resolved. They sometime but they remained after the war. We also know that the revolution does not automatically erase the ideological rust, prejudices and fears that people carry. Thus, the bias that people had on these issues was real and the dislike for homosexuality most had. The rape was the punishment of the revolutionaries arrested.
 <br/>
<br/>
 There is a basic rule in historical materialism. How every season is judged by its own measures.
 <br/>
<br/>
 But since lately, many have been said about sexuality I close with some general findings as a trigger for a debate that must be opened.
 <a href="#_edn1">
  [1]
 </a>
<br/>
<br/>
 First of all, there is no physical sexuality. The alleged natural forms in which sexual needs are met are determined by the characteristics of society, but also the sexual needs themselves are produced by society.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Capitalism and imperialism view sexuality as a commodity that is sold and purchased like everything else, undergoes the same laws and demand laws and is also destroyed by consumption. The question is what is the function and the effects of this type of sexual culture in humans.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The sex industry that leaves a footprint everywhere does not treat sex as the means to express the particular content of relationships between individuals, but as a means for each person separately in order to escape society and as a moment of enjoyment in a life without joy and hope. It seems to have distanced itself from its social characteristics, not binding but on the contrary to separate people.
 <br/>
<br/>
 There is no concept of equality in sexual standards that the bourgeoisie is promoting. It characterizes them a relationship of sovereignty and enslavement, where the dominant is a male. Nothing is positive from the reversal of sovereignty roles.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Sexuality for the ruling class is a way of demonstrating and enforcing its power and power. The triptych "Sex - Violence - Power" is promoted everywhere, is the new fashion that plays the system, especially in youth, is the promotion of the bourgeoisie in a standard.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Prohibitions and oppression of sexuality are part of sexuality. They do not oppose it but identify it. Sexual freedom in capitalism is like all other capitalist freedoms, exist only in theory and papers.
 <br/>
<br/>
 In urban sexuality we cannot contrast a model of revolutionary, labor or Marxist sexuality. Nor in socialism, the satisfaction of sexual impulse, the erotic need will not be as simple and rough as a glass of water. In sex life, Lenin used to say, not only physical elements, but also acquired culture, play a role.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Urban theories about sexuality are dominated by reasons of desire. It has become a common place to regard sexuality as a separate from class. Thus the autonomy of desire has become one of the deeper bourgeois "truths". Such positions are contrary to materialistic perception. We need to understand sexuality as both a social and a historical relationship.
 <br/>
<br/>
 The sexual crisis and the sexual problems that seem to plague people and often take up a lot of space in youth concerns, "not solved", Kolontai wrote, "without fundamental reform of human psychology, without increasing" erotic potential. " But this mental reform depends entirely on the basic reorganization of our socio-economic relations on communist bases. "

<u>
    Side One: The class root
   </u>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The female issue is class because it was born with class society. Marx and Engels have shown that the cause of the woman's unequal position is neither psychological nor biological. It didn't always exist. Changing the way material life production resulted in the appearance of the historical social phenomenon of the woman's enslavement. Therefore, there will be no forever, it can be overthrown.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  During the long period of humanity, where the origin of children were determined by the mother, the two sexes were equal and there was communion. In those primitive communist societies there was a division of labor, but it had no competitive characteristics. In a certain phase, people's work created excess tools and food, which brought the separation of society into classes.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The man was in the advantageous position to handle the superixture, which is owned. The family goes to its monogamous form in order to serve the need to transfer ownership to the descendants of the man, who must be sure to be his. Woman's work loses her social character and she is oppressed and humiliated.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  All of this builds the appropriate superstructure. With the help of religion, oppression, exploitation, lower position in society, violence, and strict monogamy of the woman are justified. With the creation of the classes, that is, the corresponding "law" was created, which consistent with this new relationship of things. It was then that, according to Engels, the "cosmopolitan defeat of the female sex" took place.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
<u>
    Side second: The intensity of the problem according to the class position
   </u>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Women are not a homogeneous social stratum but, like men, belong to different social classes which, between workers and bourgeois women, are competitive. Working women are victims of oppression due to sex and class exploitation. The lower a woman's socially, the more heavy heavy on her (pay, access to education, etc.). Women of the people and the working class experience multiple exploitation and oppression. They do not have the financial means to get rid of the burdens of the household such as the women of the ruling class who pay for other women or men to do their homework and child care. A worker is oppressed by the bourgeois feminist employer, who oppresses the male worker.

    Side Tuesday: The female issue as a case of 'order'

   "Without women there can be no real movement of the masses"
  </i>
  Lenin used to say. This is a serious compass for the case we serve. The emergence of the female issue and the struggle in the direction of female emancipation and widening of women's rights
  <i>
   'It's not feminism, it's a practical revolutionary effort'
  </i>
  (Lenin).
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As bourgeois women, when they raise bourgeois democratic demands, do so in their social class: they support capitalism, which is the basis of the exploitation of popular strata women. They defend the existence of allegedly common interests among women, regardless of which class they belong to, to hide that they belong to the one that exploits the rest. That is why bourgeois feminist organizations are completely absent from wage and pensions struggles, from motherhood claims and labor rights struggles.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>
   In summary, for us the female issue is class, because the inequality against women stems from the creation of classes and is reproduced by the bourgeoisie, today's exploitable class, without the crushing of which the woman will not be redeemed. It is, on the other hand, class because it first and primarily the poor, the working mother, the unemployed. And third, it is class because it is tied to the class workers' movement. Any disconnection of the class element from the struggle of women leads to outrageous distortions that put a serious obstacle to the hypothesis of female masses.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
   As for issues related to the superstructure:
  </b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The class nature of the female issue, which has its roots in exploitative production relations, is reflected in the construction, shaping perceptions and prejudices about the position and role of women. The school, the church, the art, the customs and the customs, the family, the media, every institution or social activity maintain and reproduce ideologies about the inferiority of the woman. Yesterday's darkness is reproduced in today's modern. All of these perceptions are not sufficient to be denounced. We do not refer the female issue to socialism, saying it will be resolved then. We are fighting for - for millennia - perceptions that consider the woman, a man of the man.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When we talk about the class of female issue, we do not underestimate the ideological struggle, but we stress that it also has a class sign. We criticize feminist organizations, not because they deal with the superstructure, but because they exhaust their action on it, and their proposals do not question the system that generates female inequality.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Marxism and the communist movement have inherited us to have a body of views on the female issue, which must be enriched, spread out, modernized. For marriage, motherhood, family, gender relationships, work and unscrupulous work at home, abortions and everything else the big issue is raised, we have an opinion. Class and ideological struggle go together. The confrontation with the perceptions that support their philosophy in the class structure of society is essential and is not easy at all. The formation of our point of view must be accompanied by an attitude of life and come out of our organized struggle.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<u>
   Unlike Marxism, feminist theories want, the exploitation of the woman and her unequal relationship with the man, to come from patriarchy
  </u>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<i>
   "Patriarchy is understood as a system that is social, political and economic. Therefore, economic practices may be patriarchal or not. Correspondingly, capitalism is an economic system that is a more specific form of the general economic system of patriarchy. This means that patriarchy historically can take various forms and capitalism is only a form of it in specific historical and social contexts.
  </i>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A common basis for different currents within the context of feminist organizations is the claim of an informal capital-men. Men benefit because they ensure that their wife is their personal maid while getting this family salary and the best jobs. They are hostile to the unions, charging them that they have historically contributed to the reinforcement of male interests with their demands (welfare for women, labor wages sufficient for the whole family, etc.) and in the depth of these views hides that they are hostile to the labor movement .
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Although the theories of patriarchy have differences between them, they agree that gender is what defines the social system, the contrasting man-woman is regarded as the basic opposition of society, not the contradiction of capital-labor.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Today, the theories of patriarchy and their derivatives, that is, the theories of social sex and gender -based violence, dominate. They have managed to penetrate almost all the spaces of the left and anarchy, which have adopted, not only the term feminism, but also everything related to feminist -bourgeois perceptions.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We disagree vertically with these views because they see the roots of the female issue in biology, in the "brutal nature of the man", as they consider that the man is the enemy and not the class structure of society.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  These views beyond that they are completely unmistakable, they extinguish every hope of the woman for emancipation. Because the basic contrast of society is between the two sexes, if its root is biology, then the only thing left is gender deconstruction. The abolition of man -woman distinction and the conversion of all into "changing subjectivity", "constructions of society". Gender is distinguished in "biological-sex" and "social-genders". These theories are metaphysical and openly state that they are confronted with Marxist views.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
<i>
    The ending of these theories is that there is no class enemy but racial. There are no bourgeois and proletarians, employers and workers but only men and women. In the name of the unity of female sex, or rather female, class peace is signed and the war is raging.
   </i>
</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The different interpretations of the female issue, class or racial, inevitably lead to two anti -diametrically opposed and, ultimately, opposing lines within the movement. On all aspects of the female issue, both in interpretation and in the way it is addressed, the goals of struggle and the demands, the same existential questions are reflected:
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The enemy is men who by their nature are violent and sexist or class society and capital. Is the enemy overturned, or should we pretend that there is no metaphysical theories? And even further, the capitalist system can or not be overturned?
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Because, if it can be overturned, then we want to overthrow it and want it all. To be liberated from the oppression that generates the capitalist mode of production that oppresses and the male worker. To build the construction that will support new production relationships and want the woman really equal.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But is feminist theories the first to defend the capitalist system itself? Is their basic concern to hide the class contradictions and the rotten of this system that is deeply rotted? They are trying to disorient and convince women that in war, poverty and poverty, hand-in-hand, bourgeois and workers, urban governments and pioneering fighters, Palestinians and Israeli femininity, they will be released Sexism.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This line struggle is shown on all aspects of the female issue. We will refer to some aspects, not because we underestimate the rest, but because our goal is not to exhaust the discussion, but help to open it after you.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
   For gender -based violence
  </b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Already before the pandemic, one in three women in the world of 15-49 years, was a victim of abuse every year, mainly by her erotic partner (Un Women, 2020). After the start of the pandemic in the US, Asia and almost everywhere in the world, the numbers of victims increased dramatically. In Greece, in January 2021 up to 10 rape of women per day, much smaller than the real one, as forensic and police authorities are estimated to be reported to be reported 1 out of 24 cases. About 4,000 incidents of rape are committed, but only 200 are reported. In all countries of Europe in recent years, women's murder has increased significantly. A pan -European study showed that between 2001 to 2014, women's murders have gradually increased. In 2017, 58% of the murdered women worldwide were murdered at home by familiar faces. The oppression and exploitation of the woman in the crisis is deepened, her position is getting worse.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  At the same time, civil law welcomes the perpetrators, through a series of laws that confirm the system's intention to subdue women even more. The Law of Tsiara (2021), for the compulsory cooperation, which gives rights to the life of former woman and minor children even if they are victims of his abuse. Changing the law on rape by submitting the victim to a forensic examination in order to prove that it was in a hurry, the anti -labor law Hatzidakis according to which the employer (ie number one perpetrator in the workplace) assumes… protection from the sexual harassment. The questioning of the right to abortion by the Church and far -right aspects of the system confirm the class origin of violence.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
   But what is the reason for this explosion of violence and what should our attitude be?
  </b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The conditions in which the people live and who do not define them do not shape them but are imposed by the greats of the world, are the ones who give birth to violence and crime, with women first on the list because of their double exploitation. The peoples are immersed in poverty, poverty, diseases and poverty. Despite technological achievements, artificial intelligence and space conquest, societies, and even in the developed West, are condemned to a modern Middle Ages characterized by inhumane working and living conditions for millions of poor, and indescribable violence. Refugees, immigrants, unemployed, employees with hunger and hunger wages, workers without rights and basic security conditions make up the millions of modern -day hells, who strive to survive in a world that does not fit them and have no prospects for them and have no prospects for them their children.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The removal of the people from collective struggle, solidarity, class consciousness. The difficulty of politicizing any movements that erupt and the difficulty they face in being victorious lead to individualism and leave everyone and everyone exposed to the attack of the system and its rotten ideals. Consumerism, the commercialization of love, the dissolution of human relationships, the treatment of the female body as a commodity, the promotion of easy wealth through gambling and prostitution, and the absolute lack of vision and perspective, alienate people. They are unable to see the class enemy, turn against each other, trying to survive in an inhumane and violent system.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Violence is therefore not gender, but class. Poor women are more exposed to violence. Their financial situation makes it more vulnerable to the blackmail and harassment of the employer, and often does not allow them to be removed from the abusive spouse, since they are not able to maintain themselves and their children who are also at risk. In addition, the laws and courts are at the service of capital and the powerful, the examples of dozens in our country, but I leave them for the debate.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A necessary clarification. We do not ignore or overlook that the rich women accept violence or, if you will, the most favored. Nor do we even more consider that rapists, killers and sexists are victims. But the rapist is not enough for us, we do not consider that the capabilities and needs can fit into such a limited and often controlled and useful, system. Treating all men as potentially rapists and murderers is not only unfair and unfounded, but hides their system responsibilities and in fact adopts the bourgeois perception that brings all issues to personal responsibility.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
   For the work
  </b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We do not mention here in the position of woman at work, we have done it in our various texts and we could see it after the conversation. More we want to dwell on two sides that have been put in the discussion on the female issue and want attention.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There is a lot of talk about women's right to have their bodies as they want themselves and to be "sex workers" and the movement to fight to have labor and professional rights and to recognize their work and contribution to society . I'm not going to say how vulgar it sounds in my ears. How tragic I think, a woman or any man, to have to sell his body and emotions to make a living. Just to say how tragic they are people who are struggling to adopt and reproduce the ideals and values of such a rotten and inhumane system and sprinkle the shit with sugar to consume them easier.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Why poor women and men, marginalized trans people have to be led to prostitution to survive or why young and young people follow the same path with a little fancy wrapper to live a comfortable life with easy money, very consumption and unbearable . Who defined these ideals and values, who left so few passes open if not the capitalist system itself. How can we consider it to be a real choice. That these people could have a decent life, with pleasant and creative work, with fees that allow them to live decent, have roofs, food, education and health for themselves and their children, but preferred to self -sustain the body and invest in the sex industry.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Isn't it hypocrisy, at the same time that we know that thousands of women are victims of trafficking, when 12 -year -olds and 14 -year -olds are systematically rushed in exchange for a plate of food and, while threatening, in fact, their own lives to talk about processing and self -determination? We do not hide behind our finger and do not rinse the system of mastic, cops and judges covering the davids and rapists, adopting such demands. Under no circumstances are we against those who are in this position, but it is our revolutionary duty to reveal the real responsible and to fight for life with rights and dignity. Because otherwise we leave the system undisturbed to reproduce its rotten rot and use the female movement to its advantage.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>
   For homework and feminist strike
  </b>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The homework is that a person can be more uninvited and created. They offer nothing to the human mind, they are boring and trap women in a microcosm monotonous and bone. Much more when it is loaded with the main responsibility of children's upbringing and old age and illnesses of elderly parents. Millions of women have spent their whole lives doing homework and taking care of all other family members, young and old, including spouses, perhaps, especially those. The feminist movement, which claims to be aimed at directly improving women's life conditions, claims a salary for homework, considers that the process of reproduction is a job and must be paid. It also defines the feminist strike. So on March 8, we do not cook, we do not wash and we do not smile, we do not hug, we do not give our children cards. In this way we are able to first accept that it is really our job to take care of the home, hoping for a small pay and, secondly, to confuse the mop with love, affection and feelings to our children and comrades. Human relationships of companionship and solidarity to be treated as a job.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On the contrary, we believe that the point should be that we will get rid of these unscrupulous jobs. Until we can have another society as mentioned by Vangelio previously, we first owe women and men who are in class struggle and on the side of women to fight so that the homework will be restricted and shared among those who are shared among those who They live in every house.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We need to decide the relationship and the role we want to have at home and in society in general. Certainly not each one alone can shake the role that the system wants to load it, but it is important to question it and try to move on to more creative roles to fit us. Instead of constantly questioning the abilities, through the burden of responsibility and guilt that have loaded us, to see our role and participation in the movement.
 </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Left and the Movement must make their account and self -criticism, whether they have succeeded, in recent decades, under the burden of the defeat of the communist movement, to deal with these issues. Participation in the movement, politicization and class consciousness constitute and steal every poor and exploited man. Talking about women and the double oppression they live in, this is not enough. They need to discuss, to challenge, to persuade themselves first to shake off the bourgeois ideology and the superiority that the system gives them to women.
 </p>
<p>
<span style="text-align: justify;">
</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Both men and women, we need to see the patterns, values, ideals, attitude, the attitude of life we adopt. The system has found new, more complex, ways to invade our minds and shape consciousness. No, it is not all -powerful, equally in deep crisis and sepsis, and the millions of poor people, the peoples, are looking for a way out and are looking to find out how they will answer. Part of this search are the outbursts of youth, which in addition to anti -war or labor claims are also concerned with broader anti -systemic issues, such as the crime in Tempi.

  The hospitable site of the books of publications outside the walls was filled, on Saturday afternoon on March 9, by people, men and women, who responded to the call of the KKE (M-L) to take part in the discussion organized by the female issue . An issue that leaves its marks on human relationships, generally on all aspects of life and which is part of the social issue, as emphasized in the opening of the discussion,
 </p>
<p>
  The discussion started with two suggestions. In the first presentation, Yianna Antoniadis developed the main aspects of the KKE (M-L) view on the subject, as recorded in the brochure that issued a year ago, as well as a number of issues, such as the issue of feminist strikes, prostitution- 'Droopic' and more (you can read it
  <a href="https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_27.html" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  ). In the second presentation, Vangelio Dermitzakis developed the dual character of female oppression, how to see the female issue today and the need to reconstruct the female movement. He also referred to issues raised in the Soviet Union in 1934 and 1936, on the occasion of the Insert Tribute to the EFSYN newspaper for "homosexuality in the Soviet Union" (you can read it
  <a href="https://antigeitonies3.blogspot.com/2024/03/blog-post_81.html" target="_blank">
   here
  </a>
  ).
 </p>
<p>
  Subsequently, a rich dialogue was developed with many placements that added additional elements to the various issues that had been raised. Maternity, work, women's rights, homework, sexuality, LGBTKI rights, problems and dilemmas of a woman who is militant in the movement and much more. The discussion that kept everyone's interest undiminished has helped to understand the multifaceted female issue and to the efforts made by the KKE (M-L) to study it in today's conditions, to contribute to the reconstruction of the female movement and to chart it with its tools Historical materialism, the lines and goals of its struggle.

<strong>
   Comrade Lenin is the leader of the international proletariat and the great mentor of Marxism -Leninism.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  “
  <strong>
   We are the army established by Comrade Lenin, a great proletarian strategy. Nothing has a higher honor than this army. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin).
 </p>
<p>
<a>
</a>
  As shown in the pages of history, on January 21, 1924, the immortal Comrade Lenin was the world's worker class and the great leader who oppressed the people, and the second great milestone of Marxist Maoism. He left an inestimable great heritage. Comrade Lenin's doctrine has changed the foundation of the "future body" laid from Marx and Engels from abstract possibilities to specific reality. , Still sufficient significance. In order to correct yourself in the class struggle, you must accept this "reality" and position yourself here. This "reality" is also a good medicine to deal with improvementism, amendments and parliamentary fans. These ideas mean the surrender and compromise of any form of dominant ideology. This "reality" is the guarantee of the conviction and determination to establish the communist world.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   As a mentor of Communistism, Lenin broke the deadlock and paved the way to oppose the process of opposing international reactionists and corremists.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Correctly recognizing the contradictions in the history of class struggle and grasping the time of historical breaks, and preparing for these breaks are the most prominent feature of Comrade Lenin's lifelong immortal struggle. After Marx and Engels died, the leadership of the international proletariat was taken over by the opportunityist of the Second International for a long time. In the words of Comrade Stalin
  <strong>
   : "During this period, the second international political parties cannot continue the theoretical struggle that the international proletariat and the world are oppressed from the influence of the influence of the social Democrats of the social Democratic party, which are opportunistic and class compromise. In addition to the theoretical struggle that is oppressed by the world, with the establishment of the Communist International, he has developed a form of dynamic organization and struggle suitable for the new period of capitalist class struggle. "
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin liberated the Communist Party and the Communist International from the restraint of the legal struggle in the legal struggle, and turned the Communist Party and the Communist International into a war tool against the bourgeoisie.
  <strong>
   ：“
  </strong>
<strong>
   There are no revolutionary policies, but relaxed vulgarism and dirty politics bargaining, and parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary conspiracy. Of course, for the sake of appearance, they passed the "revolutionary" resolution and slogan.
  </strong>
<strong>
   ”
  </strong>
  But it "stored in the drawer in the office" has got rid of the constraints of the form of legal struggle.
  <strong>
   "At the same time, the new period of the imperialist war and the proletarian revolutionary struggle is coming. In the face of the omnipotent of financial capital, the old combat method is proven to be obviously insufficient and weak. Reform thoroughly, reform all its working methods, and remove all vulgarism, narrow thoughts, politicians' style of drama, rebellious social sand literaryism and social peaceism. It is necessary to check the entire thermal arsenal of the Second International and throw away all rust of rust. And forging new weapons. Without this preliminary work, it is useless to start against capitalism. Without this work, the proletariat may find that it is insufficient for armed forces in the future revolutionary struggle, or even There is no armed at all. The honor of the second international Ode Asl (here to accumulate the accumulation of accumulation of accumulation), the honor of comprehensive reform and large cleaning has fallen on Leninism's shoulders. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin, "On the Basis of Leninism")
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin seized the core of the contradiction with his talent. He realized that if you do not get rid of the burden of suppressing the international proletariat, different amendments and opportunism are struggled, and the theoretical and practical nature of these views will not be shown to the masses. Enough effectiveness and success. By establishing a dialectical and inevitable connection between the establishment of "internal struggle" and "external struggle", he made double struggles.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin left a very important lesson for the Communists, that is, the struggle against revisionism and opportunism, and the struggle of the reactionaries against the imperialism and all forms was inseparable. On the contrary, in the struggle against imperialism, we must clear the amendments and opportunist ideas in their own teams.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   In the increasingly acute contradictions of the imperialist system, Lenin's teaching
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin's system of imperialism in detail in the early 20th century was still retained in the past time, but its contradiction is still sharp, and it is in a spiral rise of conflicts that cannot be resolved. Although the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the integration of capitalism in China have not erupted the contradictions for the time being, the law of uneven development of capitalism continues. This system is in crisis, and the previous "solutions" are no longer effective. The imperialists have long transferred their own burdens to the semi -colonial land, and they can also come here to delay their crisis by deepening their plundering to delay their crisis.
 </p>
<p>
  One of the contradictions of the inherent problems of the imperialist system developed according to Lenin's definition of imperialism is one of the internal struggles of imperialist imperialism in various forms in recent years. It is currently being launched in local war. When Lenin enumerated the contradictions of imperialism, mentioning that the internal contradictions of imperialism are one of the three most important contradictions.
 </p>
<p>
  We can see that the development of the situation is in line with Comrade Lenin's observation of the nature and contradictions of imperialism:
  <strong>
   "The second contradiction is the contradiction between the financial groups and the powers of imperialism to compete for raw materials and compete for other territories. Imperialism is to output capital to the origin of raw materials, which is crazy for the original raw material origin. The struggle is to fight the world that has been divided by the melon, which is to find the new financial group and the powers who are looking for "under the sun" to seize the old financial groups and the powers who are not released from death and the powers. Fighting. The characteristics of this crazy struggle between capitalist groups are the inevitable factor that contains the war of imperialist war and a war to seize the territory of other countries. Weaken each other, weaken the entire capitalist position, approach the timing of the proletarian revolution, and make the proletarian revolution. "
  </strong>
  (Stalin, "On the Basis of Leninism")
 </p>
<p>
  The two former socialist countries, Russia and China, have provided an opportunity to breathe the imperialist system through their own new markets. They have become the main participants in the internal competition of imperialism and compete with the United States as an hegemonic country. This means that as new and powerful participants are increasingly participating in the struggle of re -distribution of territory, the degree and nature of contradictions will increase. The great confrontation with the Russianist invasion of Ukraine happened in this context. It is foreseeable that this trend will further deepen and spread. As long as there is no direct confrontation between imperialism, the regions where territorial redistributions are assigned to the semi -colonial and colonies. The semi -colonial and oppressed people in the world will continue to pay for these wars until the imperialists directly declare war.
 </p>
<p>
  In this way, the world has split into a few imperialist countries and most of the oppressed countries -Lenin cleverly analyzed this -and deepened this. The third contradiction is sharply sharp with the various plundering of imperialism, and accompanied by the powerful national liberation war and the people's war of the imperialist system with the upward trend of the semi -colonial and semi -feudal countries.
 </p>
<p>
  In the process of being in their own internal contradictions and the contradictions between their own internal contradictions and the contradictions of the oppressed people and the oppressed nation, all parts of the rule system, especially the imperialist countries, have become more concentrated. The same militarism and good emotions as in the past paved the way for all fascist emotions and brought society into the corresponding ideological style. This is either realized by the so -called right -wing extremists, or under the veil of the Social Democratic or Liberal Party. The reality of the Communists and the oppressed people in the world, in the face of the increasingly reactionary and aggressive system, requires a Leninist party to lead the proletariat to fight for power from the proletariat. Essence Only such a party is now the party of Marx Lenin's Mao Zeduism, can we lead an irreconcilable struggle against the bourgeoisie.
 </p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">
<strong>
   Lenin's great heritage, Leninism's concept of the party, is the general staff of the proletariat
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
   The revolution is not to dinner, not to do articles, not painting and embroidery. It cannot be so elegant. Revolution is a riots, a violent action of a class overthrowing a class.
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong)
 </p>
<p>
  How the Communists define the contradictions of the existence and how they position themselves in the development of the situation. In the 100 years after Comrade Lenin's death, imperialists have turned their dominance structure into larger machines. Their army, police, Special Service Bureau, etc. all have their unparalleled ability in the past. On the other hand, a considerable part of the person who claims to be "communists" or "revolutionaries" ignores this reality (even if it seems to be accepted theory), and it is far from positioning itself according to it. However, by following the ideological and practical reconciliation line, the working class and the oppressed masses are locked in the rule of the masses in the rule of the rule, and served as a dyke. When imperialists and exploiters are equipped with more and more violent equipment and institutions for themselves, as followers of Comrade Lenin, it is necessary to carry out strong ideological struggles and oppose those who claim to be "revolutionaries" and "Communist Communities" and "Communist Communities". People of doctrine are more and more away from the reality of the revolution and revolutionary struggle on the basis of weapons and violence. Guided by Comrade Lenin's unremitting struggle against the second international opportunism, it was one of the important tasks of the centennial death of Comrade Lenin's death.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin defines the new Communist Party as "the war organization of the proletariat." This definition is necessary due to the corresponding position of the imperialist system and class. The process of triggering the October Revolution and the civil war that broke out with the October Revolution was the specific reason why Comrade Lenin said the Communist Party was the "proletarian war organization". The Communist Party, which leads the proletariat and the liberation of the masses, must have this characteristic, but the counter -revolutionary is armed with violent machines and means from top to bottom, and all these terrible massacres are on the working class and the oppressed people. The revolutionary war needs a party to launch it. Only the fools who rely on the bourgeoisie and the irregular amendments have other opinions on this.
 </p>
<p>
<strong>
   Some people laughed at us as the supporters of the "Universal War". Yes, we are the supporters of the omnipotent revolutionary war. This is good, not bad, this is Marxism. The Russian Communist Party's gun created socialism. We will establish a democratic Republic. The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us that the working class and the workers can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords only with the power of guns. In this sense, we can say that only with guns can change the entire world.
  </strong>
  (Mao Zedong)
 </p>
<p>
  The International Communist Alliance has determined the construction and reorganization of the Communist Party as an important task in the fighting of the Communist Party at its establishment conference. Comrade Mao Zedong's understanding of the Communist Party was the understanding of Comrade Lenin, and it was also enriched by Stalin. It was the realization of the party's understanding of the party in Marxism -Leninism. During our imperialism and proletarian revolution, we can oppose the increasing aggressiveness of the imperialist reactionaries, and the Communist Party, which can lead the proletarian and the world's oppression of the people, must have the quality of the "proletarian war organization".
 </p>
<p>
  An important heritage of Lenin is to take political power as the basic issue of every revolution. Lenin stated,
  <strong>
   "There is no violence on the bourgeois state machines, and no new state machines are replaced by it. The proletarian revolution is impossible."
  </strong>
  ,as well as
  <strong>
   "Except for power, everything is fantasy."
  </strong>
  Essence Under Lenin's personal leadership, the world's first socialist country and proletarian dictatorship was established, and the road of the proletariat obtained power and maintained it.
 </p>
<p>
  After the death of Lenin, it was his successor Stalin's outstanding definition of Leninism, further developing Leninism, and making it the basis of the entire international communist movement. On the great Lenin's shoulders, Chairman Mao was able to push the world's proletarian revolution to a higher level and develop the ideological form of the proletariat. Today's Leninism, now Marxism -Leninism, must be accepted, defended and applied.
 </p>
<p>
  As a member of the International Communist Alliance, we will continue to complete the task proposed by the great Lenin and better use the heritage left by Comrade Lenin.
 </p>
<p>
  Comrade Lenin, the great mentor of the international proletariat and Marx Lenin Mao Zedongism, leads us in the current era to lead us to fight for the world's proletarian revolution.
 </p>
<p>

   Long live Marx Lenin Mao Zedongism!

   In this moment of deep crisis that our country is going through, women and dissidents take to the streets because we live a serious and alarming situation with hunger, unemployment, salary gap, work precariousness, sexist violence, miserable wages, dismissals, etc.
  </p>
<p>
   To this situation are added the abuses and violence towards the feminisms and diversities of the misogynist and fascist Milei: the ministry closed, there is no budget to combat gender violence, with 75 femicides this year that is not simply a number that alarm, they are women whose lives snatched the sexist violence. They want to prohibit the law of voluntary interruption of pregnancy and eli. And they caused when on Friday morning they announced that the Women's Hall of the Casa Rosada would be renamed as Hall of the Próceres, replacing the Juana Azurduy box with that of the deliveryman and vendatria Carlos Menem.

<p>
   This massive national day expressed that we are not going to take a step back in defending the rights conquered with years of struggle and we give the fight for which we still have.

   At the closing of the act in Congress, a document of the group of women and dissidents was read "Here we are: we were tide, we will be tsunami." In one of his paragraphs he points out: “We are facing an authoritarian government that represents the patriarchal reaction, which speaks of the chainsaw to celebrate a systematic plan of looting and hunger and to destroy the rights of the working class and the people, because it is at Service of international capitals that come for our common goods and our life, and to be able to do it, they need a hungry town, without work, without housing, without education and without health. We repudiate the drainage of the State: the deregulation, privatization and emptying of public policies. We repudiate the layoffs! ”

   Throughout the province we live a massive and forceful day of the working woman of struggle, for our specific claims as women.
  </p>
<p>
   We all marched by ourselves and in self-defense against this reactionary policy of Milei-Macri-Bullrich that hunger us and condemns us to violence and femicides. Today women are the most affected by the deep economic and social crisis.

The column left from the high of the city ending in the civic center with a popular pot. In a unified document we denounce how this policy affects us and that is why we are about to face it. We join all: women from unions, of social movements, originally.

Then, an immense column of more than five compact blocks with Nicol Posada's family in the head, the last victim of femicide in the province on February 17. The emergency campaign in violence against women and the pink scarf was the protagonist of the mobilization. A unified document was read by denouncing the adjustment of the national government and the burning of dolls was made with the face of Milei, Villarruel and Bullrich.

   We focus on the family's square, a place that historically houses the struggle of women in our city. The particularity was the meeting of many women from different neighborhoods and of different ages who sang against Milei's adjustment and hunger policy and demanded to maintain the conquered rights. The grandmother and aunt of Agustina Atencio, one of the three victims of femicide of Catriel was present in the march. The undersecretary of women, equality and diversity of the municipality, Lucia Galván, expressed concern about the situation that women are going through and promised to continue working in territory.
  </p>
<p>
   In Río Negro, we live a massive 8 m, unity and in the streets denouncing each and every one of the abuses. The only need and urgency is to stop hunger and femicides. We reaffirm that without public policies, there is no gender equity, there is not one less.

   More than fifteen thousand women copied the streets of our province in commemoration of the historic day of March 8. We did it under the slogans below the DNU, enough of adjustment and in defense of our rights.
  </p>
<p>
   The successful and massive day was the result of a great effort to unify the entire women's movement of the province.
  </p>
<p>
   The multisectoral of women, in coordination with other forces converged in an extraordinary act where we could express our total repudiation of the reactionary government of Milei, a hunger and hunger partner by particularly attacking women and diversities, attacking our rights and holding misogynistic and patriarchal speeches .
  </p>
<p>
   All sectors were present, occupied workers, unemployed, native, peasants, secondary and university students in a column of wide unit coordinated by the strain, the companions of the house of women Nassif, the women of the CCC, FNC, the companions of guilds and unions, the environmentalists, of the culture, the teachers, retired, relatives of victims of femicides and other sectors.
  </p>
<p>
   This massive day of struggle firmly demonstrated that we are not going to take a step back in defending the conquered and fighting for what we are still owed, that we are not afraid of the antipiquetes of Milei and Bullrich protocol.
  </p>
<p>
   The repudiation was enormous with the positioning of our provincial deputies, who endorsed by Governor Jaldo, voted against the interests of the country.

   The day of March 8 in the province was massive and summoned many women, more than at other times. In Paraná, the unity between the two historical currents that have approached the Movement of Women and Feminist - the multisectoral of entrerrianan women and the assembly of women, lesbians, transvestites, trans and not binaries -, arises as the key to face reactionary policies and macho of Milei. The Assembly document for 8M, joint elaboration, raises “neither one more attack, nor one less right. We are not the caste. With hunger, precarization and repression there is no freedom. General unemployment now! "

Founded by the Comintern in 1920, Red Aid in 1923 declared the 18th of March, the date of the founding of the  Paris  Commune,  the  "International  Day  of  Solidarity  with  Political  Prisoners"  and dedicated it to political prisoners. On the 18th of March, solidarity with political prisoners is expressed worldwide. In every period of history, there has been great resistance to the systems of exploitation and oppression in which we have lived for thousands of years, and a high price has been paid. The reaction of the ruling classes to every struggle against the ruling systems of exploitation, to every resistance, has been similar: to crush every movement against their existence in order to preserve their existence and, above all, to destroy those who led this movement. Because the anger that has built up against the ruling order, the dynamism that comes from the desire and the effort to change the existing order, can only be directed in the right direction under the right leadership. That is why the ruling classes want to destroy those who channel the people's  anger  and  desire  for  change  and  isolate  from  the  people  those  who  cannot  be destroyed. The other dimension of the intolerance and aggression of the ruling classes against the  revolutionary,  communist  and  democratic  popular  movements  is  to  ensure  that  the oppressed masses of the people remain silent and do not dare to revolt. By massacring and suppressing the vanguards of the people, the ruling classes send a message to the oppressed masses of the people: "If you act against us, we will do the same to you". "Philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change  it"  said  Karl  Marx,  the  great  master  of  the  proletariat.  Communists  and<br/><br/> revolutionaries  fight for the  realization of  this  ideal,  they  are murdered  for it,  they  are imprisoned for it. Communist and revolutionary prisoners have shown again and again in torture centers and prisons that as long as life goes on, great examples can be created for the continuation of the class struggle under all living conditions. The way requires taking these risks and it is with this consciousness that communists and revolutionaries fight against the ruling systems of exploitation. The body of every murdered communist and revolutionary, every time spent in prison also lays the foundation for building the society of the future. The bourgeoisie and its lackeys want to ensure the capitulation by putting those who cannot be slaughtered  in  prisons  under  the  most  oppressive  conditions.  The  communist  and revolutionary prisoners, on the other hand, do not hesitate to turn the prisons, where the enemy feels strongest, into an arena of class struggle. For this reason, we must not define the communist and revolutionary prisoners in prisons as victims, but we must define them on the basis  of  their  justice  and  embrace  them.  Communists  and  revolutionaries  are  not  only murdered,  imprisoned  and  tortured  because  they  have  alternative  ideas  to  the  existing systems of exploitation, but also because they do something to change these ideas, to organize and unite the people. It is first and foremost an ideological war, embodied by two hostile and irreconcilable  classes.  Since  the  objective  conditions  of  the  imperialist  system  keep  the contradiction  between  the  oppressor  and  the  oppressed  constant  and  current,  the assassination  and  imprisonment  of  communists  and  revolutionaries  does  not  solve  the problem for the bourgeoisie. The existing objective situation, the deepening contradictions are directly reflected in the class contradictions and the gap of the murdered and imprisoned revolutionaries and communists is filled with new ones.  To the extent that the contradictions of the ruling system deepen and its impasses multiply, to the extent that their fear of the "gravedigger" grows, the ruling classes do not hesitate to reveal their true character more and more concretely. At the same time, the deepening and unresolved crisis of the system is leading the bourgeoisie and the exploiting ruling classes of all kinds to centralize the mechanism of the sovereign State more strongly, both with its laws and its de facto organizations, and to bring the mechanisms of oppression more to the fore. In the  imperialist  capitalist  countries,  which  call  themselves  "ideal"  and  "progressive democracies", the successive security laws, the new laws extending the powers of the State repressive organs, show us concretely that the bourgeoisie has left behind the ability to wear the "mask of democracy". The bourgeoisie is re-establishing its position against the working class,  the  oppressed  laborers  and  the  oppressed  peoples  with  all  its  reactionism.  In  the colonial and semi-colonial countries dominated by imperialism, parliamentary and extra- parliamentary forms of government with various shades of fascism and reaction are the usual  regimes.  In  these  countries,  all  oppositionists,  starting  with  the  communists  and revolutionaries, are subjected to systematic and permanent State terror. The depth of the contradiction  between  the  ruling  classes  and  the  oppressed  people  in  these  countries determines the intensity of the class struggle. For the ruling classes, who can only maintain the servitude of imperialism through an unbridled regime of terror against the people, State terror is a necessity rather than an option. The laws are only a cover for fascism, reaction and State terror. Prisons, on the other hand, are a mechanism of torture and oppression. The<br/><br/>ruling  classes  of  Turkey,  India,  the  Philippines,  Peru,  Iran,  Israel  etc.  are  deepening  the isolation they label with almost all the letters of the alphabet in order to capture the prisoners in the prisons. The treatment of seriously ill prisoners is prevented under various pretexts, many  sick  prisoners  are  left  to  die  and  there  are  repeated  actual  attacks  on  prisoners. Thousands of members of the Kurdish nation are caught in prisons as the price of the Kurdish national  liberation  struggle.  In  Turkish  prisons,  the  release  of  people  who  have  been imprisoned for more than 30 years is prevented on the grounds that they "do not give up their thoughts". The reactionary Indian State has locked up over ten thousand communist, revolutionary and political activists, including Varavara Rao, Sanjoy Deepak Rao, Ayinoor Vasu, Rona Wilson and Gautam Navlakha to pre vent the People’s War. Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has been imprisoned by French imperialism for 40 years and has not yet been released, although he has served his sentence. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a member of the Black Panthers, has been imprisoned by US imperialism for over 40 years. Thousands of communists, revolutionaries and prisoners of oppressed peoples from different parts of the world have spent decades in prisons. The ruling classes' fear of the communist and revolutionary prisoners and the class enmity they  feel  towards  them  is  so  great  that  they  ruthlessly  prevent  the  communists  and revolutionaries  they  hold  captive  in  open  violation  of  their  own  laws  from  leaving  the prisons. The assassination of Chairman Gonzalo in 2021, the leader of the PCP, who lost his health  after  29  years  in  solitary  confinement  and  whose  death  was  caused  because  the necessary measures were not taken, is very imp ortant to understand the extent of the fear and class hatred felt by the imperialists and the servile owners of the ruling system. Those responsible for the death of  Chairman Gonzalo even burned and destroyed his body. The communist and revolutionary prisoners in the prisons are trying to fulfill the demands of the class struggle at the risk of their lives by going to the limits of prison conditions. They refuse to capitulate and do not hesitate to resist all kinds of pressure, torture and solitary confinement.  We  must  mobilize  to  support  the  legitimate  struggle  and  resistance  of  the prisoners, to fight against any kind of aggression against the prisoners, to be the voice of the prisoners outside, we must support their struggle under the conditions of imprisonment as part of the class struggle outside. THE COMMUNIST AND REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS ARE OUR HONOR! SUPPORTING THE COMMUNIST AND REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS MEANS SUPPORTING THE REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE! LET US MAKE THE RESISTANCE AND STRUGGLE OF THE COMMUNIST AND REVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS OUR OWN. LET US BE THE VOICE OF THE PRISONERS! International Communist League March 2024</p></div>
