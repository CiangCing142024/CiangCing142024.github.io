But this time we could not rely on the light of the candles and, even if the batteries of our phone were about to discharge, we all turned on the torches on our cell phones to help Nour to see well\n  </em>\n  , \"Nabeel said.\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  Aya, her husband and their two children had left their home in Al-Rimal Street, in the center of Gaza City, during the first week of war, and had refuge in the house of his family in the Al-Sahaba neighborhood in the east . \"\n  <em>\n   The sounds of the bombings were very strong, mixed with the cries of Aya and the voices of his relatives and other displaced people who prayed\n  </em>\n  \" - Nabeel's tone, Sorella in Aya.\n  <br/>\n  The house has several floors and apartments, so the entire enlarged family was welcome.\n  <br/>\n  During war times, the families of Gaza tend to meet in a single place, looking for protection and comfort. There is a common desire to live or die together.\n  <br/>\n  Nabeel described the birth of the new family member as something left from the screen of a film and \"\n  <em>\n   Beyond reality\n  </em>\n  \u201d.\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  \u201c\n  <em>\n   The women directed their torches to Aya and the men out prayed for his salvation. All in the building, all the displaced people in all apartments, were awake and repeated 'Ya Rab, Ya Rab\n  </em>\n  \u2019[In Arabic means oh, God],\". \"\n  <em>\n   The sounds of the bombings were very strong, mixed with the cries of Aya while fighting to give birth and the voices of her relatives and other displaced people who prayed and told her that they were strong and to resist. Everything was surreal. As much as the details can describe, nobody can imagine the scene\n  </em>\n  \u201d.\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  <strong>\n   No medical equipment\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, the Israeli army destroyed 52 medical structures and 56 ambulances in the Gaza Strip, and killed at least 283 health workers. So far about 18,000 Palestinians have been killed, the vast civilian majority. Aya's family did not expect it to give birth so soon, so no emergency plan had been agreed. Without medical equipment, they had to use domestic objects they had at home. \"\n  <em>\n   The weather was about to expire and we feared for the life of the girl while Nour and Aya were struggling to pull her out. The voices of the prayers were heard and I kept the cell phone with the torch, I read the Koran and cried\n  </em>\n  \", Nabeel continued.\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  \u201c\n  <em>\n   A few minutes later, the girl finally was born and once out, Aya and everyone broke out in tears. It was a moment of relief for all of us. Nour embraced Aya strong and kissed her on the forehead, and the displaced people applauded and thanked God\n  </em>\n  \".\" Nabeel said they managed to get away with disinfected scissors and laundry springs, but when it was a placenta, there was nothing appropriate at hand to extract it. \"\n  <em>\n   Nour had to perform the postpartum treatments with bare hands, cleaning Aya's uterus and manually extracting the placenta. And fortunately, he didn't have to cut part of the vagina during childbirth, so he didn't need to suture it\n  </em>\n  \", he added. \"\n  <em>\n   The next morning, they went to the complex\n  </em>\n  [medico]\n  <em>\n   of Al-Sahaba to control Aya and the girl's health, and thank God they were in perfect condition\n  </em>\n  .\u201d\n  <br/>\n  According to Dr. Adan Radi, obstetric and gynecologist of the Al-Awda hospital in the north of the Gaza Strip, there are about 55,000 pregnant women in Gaza who need regular health care.\n  <br/>\n  \u201c\n  <em>\n   We called the small mass\n  </em>\n  [diamond, in Arabic]\n  <em>\n   because the conditions in which it was born were unusual, but also because it is precious and stubborn\n  </em>\n  \", Nabeel said. \"\n  <em>\n   He insisted on being born, in the middle of all adverse circumstances\n  </em>\n  .\u201d\n </p>\n <p align=\"justify\">\n  (*) Source:\n  <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-war-gaza-giving-birth-home?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Social_Traffic&amp;utm_content=ap_ebmrtmmlrx\">\n   English version\n  </a>\n  .
