Representing the military right, ultra-reactionary Hamilton Mour\u00e3o had no doubt: \"He is right, this is passed,\" he said, referring to the military coup and the fascist military regime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Estad\u00e3o, accustomed to criticizing Luiz In\u00e1cio, rushed to leave in his defense: \u201cLula acts correctly\u201d when she refuses to talk about the 1964 coup in the passage of her 60 years, in line with \u201can imperative of governability in a context of Wounds waiting for healing \u201dand\u201c is also a way to honor the current military command, also artificial of pacification \u201d, said in the editorial\u201c The accommodation of Lula with the military \u201d(March 17). Speaking of wounds, it is simply pathetic that Estad\u00e3o who has already argued that the government reopens the Special Commission on Political Dead and Missing (CEMDP), what Luiz Inacio refuses to do, capitule choir with the cowardly complicity of this government.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Only reactionary ideologues - committed first and foremost to the continuity of the exploitation of the people and the nation - and the opportunists, whose castrated mentality by decades of subservience and conciliation with the enemies of popular masses believe that appeasement will lead to the country's stabilization.\n </p>\n <p p=\"\">\n  <p>\n   Even before Bolsonaro, the High Command changed the result of the elections (2018), when removing Luiz Inacio from the match, through blackmail during a habeas corpus vote of that candidate in the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As we see: Long before Bolsonaro assumed - and independent of him - the latent wound of coup again manifested acutely, even because it was not properly treated since 1988, when the previous appeasement with gorillas and transition with the amnesty military regime General and unrestricted, he led that there was no punishment, nor change in high military official, nor in the curricula of formation, nor in the doctrine of the Armed Forces, which followed, all these years, glorifying the 1964 coup as a legitimate movement and even as \u201cDemocratic Revolution,\u201d and when they remove from the forefront of managing the old state, resuming the belief of being the armed forces as a moderating power and spitting of the \u201cdemocratic rule of law\u201d - and therefore also spun from their restriction or Even suspension, as he blatantly tried to make Bolsonaro.\n  </p>\n  <p p=\"\">\n   <p>\n    When Luiz In\u00e1cio elects the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all the favorable conditions to be restored for the Military High Command to return to the offensive later. When the masses rise in defense of their rights, which is inevitable, gorillas, as a moderating power to believe, will again rise threatening the country with military intervention to save the nation from \"disintegration.\" Because they were not seriously confronted when they were demoralized and fragile, the gorillas will find favorable ground for a new coup climb.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The appeasement with the military summit only breastfeed the coup!\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    To genuine, progressive and revolutionary democrats, in addition to the popular masses in struggle, there is no other way other than with the 60th anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the ignominious 1964 coup and coup, either in the form of institutional rupture, or in the form of \u201cmoderating power\u201d. Commitments to fascists and scammers - who would only lead us to coup and fascism are not acceptable.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://anovademocracia.com.br/editorial-semanal-apaziguamento-so-amamenta-o-golpismo/", "type": "article", "title": "Weekly editorial - appeasement only breastfeeding coup - the new democracy", "description": "When Luiz In\u00e1cio elects the policy of appeasement to deal with the military crisis, he is allowing all the favorable conditions to be restored for the Military High Command to return to the offensive later.", "modified time": "2024-03-20T20:36:37-03:00", "updated time": "2024-03-20T20:36:37-03:00", "author": ["Reda\u00e7\u00e3o de AND"], "categories": ["Editorial"], "tags": ["60 anos de 1964", "crise militar"], "sections": ["Editorial"], "link-section": "situacao-politica", "source_name": "A Nova Democracia"}
