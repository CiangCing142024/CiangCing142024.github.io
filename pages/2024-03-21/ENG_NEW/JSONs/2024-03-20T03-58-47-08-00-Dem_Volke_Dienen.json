The boycott of the elections refuses to legitimation to the old system and answers the question of how change can instead go to the fact that the popular masses, led by the revolutionaries, have to fight against the old system with revolutionary violence. This applies not only to the conditions in Mexico, but is a strategic question which applies to every country in the world, regardless of whether it is an oppressed nation or an imperialist nation.\n </p>\n</div>\n", "source": "https://demvolkedienen.org/index.php/de/t-international/8386-wahlboykott-in-mexiko-angriffe-auf-institutionen-des-alten-staates", "keywords": ["Internetplattform", "revolution\u00e4re Bewegung", "Dem Volke Dienen", "Nachrichten", "Theorie"], "author": "laji", "description": "Internet platform for the development of a revolutionary movement", "title": "Election boycott in Mexico: Attacks on the old state institutions", "tags": ["Mexiko", "Wahlboykott"], "source_name": "Dem Volke Dienen"}
