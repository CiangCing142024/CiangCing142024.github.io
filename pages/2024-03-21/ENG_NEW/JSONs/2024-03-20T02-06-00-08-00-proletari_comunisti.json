late evening of yesterday, various patrols of the Carabinieri Radiomobile Operational Unit carried out home searches at the home of three Si Cobas unionists, active in the front row in the fight against the Maxi of Belfiore: Asmerom Zemenfia and Abbas Mohsan of the national executive and Florina Ghiorghita of the national coordination.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: start;\">\n   All three companions were seized by cell phones and their respective SIMs, considered \"body of the crime\", relating to the strikes started from June last year to claim the actual and integral application of the CCNL freight and logistics transport in the warehouse of the GDO of Belfiore, and which in recent weeks has produced 17 days of strike and garrisons outside the gates following the will of the new supplier (the Manhandwork Cooperative) not to recognize the SI Cobas, largely majority among the workers.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: start;\">\n   The main charges, needless to say, are the usual: private violence, resistance to public officials and road blocking as well as \"revised and corrected\" by the new security decree of the Meloni government.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: start;\">\n   Evidently the Prosecutor of Verona, who issued the search mandate, intends to use the seizures of the personal goods of our companions as an intimidation tool in order to stop\n   <span>\n    <a name=\"more\">\n    </a>\n   </span>\n   The strikes outside the Maxidi warehouses and the protests of the workers who have developed in recent weeks also on the-sales points, reaching the point of expressing assessments of merit on the rightness or otherwise of the strikes: an all political judgment that should exhate from the role and by the Duties of a prosecutor ...\n  </div>\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: start;\">\n   Indeed, the investigation deeds accuse the strikers of having turned on fires to warm up during the garrison at night, and even justify the imminent aggression of a company vigilante that last month, as well as widely documented by us, He came to point the gun in the face of workers !!!\n  </div>\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: start;\">\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align: start;\">\n   As far as we are concerned, we strongly report this yet another repressive and intimidating act towards our organization, and we reiterate once again that the legitimacy of the strikes decide are not the courts nor the owners, but the workers: those workers who in the Strike put their wages and their jobs at stake in order to eliminate exploitation, hunger wages and anti -union reprisals.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div class=\"x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n  <div dir=\"auto\" style=\"text-align:
